Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Superior Uniform Group's 2017 Fourth Quarter and Year-end Earnings Conference Call. With us today are<br>Michael Benstock, the company's Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Demott, the Chief Operating Officer and CFO.<br>
(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded and your participation implies that you agree to this. If you don't, then simply drop off the line.<br>Now I will turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Senior Vice President of Halliburton Investor Relations, who will read the safe harbor statement.<br>Please go ahead.<br>
<b>Hala Elsherbini</b> - Halliburton Investor Relations - SVP and COO<br>
Thank you, Phil. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements about Superior Uniform Group's business opportunities and its<br>anticipated results of operations. Please bear in mind that forward-looking information is subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may<br>differ from what you hear today. Many of these risks and uncertainties are described in Superior Uniform Group's annual report on Form 10-K for<br>fiscal 2017 in this morning's news release and in the company's other filings with the SEC.<br>
Forward-looking statements in this conference call are based on our current expectations and beliefs. Management does not undertake any duty<br>to update the forward-looking statements made during this conference call or elsewhere. Please note that all growth comparisons that management<br>makes today will relate to the corresponding period in 2016, unless otherwise noted.<br>
With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.<br>
<b>Michael L. Benstock</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - CEO &amp; Inside Director<br>
Thank you, Hala. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results. This quarter, we've provided<br>a few supplemental slides to augment our remarks to better explain the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Andy will specifically<br>address during his remarks. We've also included a slide that outlines our updated expectations for our long-term top line growth guidance. These<br>slides can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.<br>
As usual, I will begin by discussing key highlights for Q4 and 2017 and provide our thoughts on market trends. Next, Andy will provide more detail<br>about our financial performance, tax reform impact and accounting changes. Afterwards, I'll review our outlook and offer some general thoughts<br>on the future. We will then be happy to take your questions.<br>
We had a strong finish to fiscal 2017 with the fourth quarter marking our 21st consecutive quarter of increasing year-over-year revenue. Fourth<br>quarter consolidated net sales in 2017 increased 12% over the same quarter in 2016. For the entire year, consolidated sales were up 5.6%.<br>

<A name=8></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 7:00PM, SGC - Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call<br>
Our net sales growth was highlighted by double-digit growth in Promotional Products, and The Office Gurus, our remote staffing segment, had<br>record growth. Our uniform segment had mixed results from channel to channel and posted a decline of 1.5% in the fourth quarter.<br>
Overall, we achieved solid profitability with a great boost from our sourcing strategies and further streamlining of operations. Throughout the year,<br>we saw a margin improvement and into the fourth quarter as well with an operating margin of 9.7% compared to 9.3% in the 2016 fourth quarter.<br>For the full year, our operating margin grew to 9.2% compared to 8.6% in 2016.<br>
Now let's review fourth quarter segment performance. In our core uniform segment, revenue declined 1.5% for the fourth quarter and 2.7% for<br>the year. For the quarter, we saw positive signs in our employee ID business led by HPI Direct, which delivered solid performance. For the full year,<br>however, sales on the employee ID side of the business declined and were impacted by the loss of one of our large legacy customers we described<br>during our first quarter call as well as the elimination of 2 recurring promotional uniform programs. Andy will detail this further in his remarks.<br>
In the latter part of 2017, we kicked off strategic initiatives to integrate Superior I.D. and HPI, leveraging the strengths of each group to create a<br>strong and more efficient organization. We are already seeing some benefits from the utilization of our administrative and operational shared<br>services and expect to continue to benefit as we aggressively create one even stronger entity from these 2 solid, well-managed organizations. We<br>will continue to fully integrate the groups over the next year or so, taking our time to make sure that we enhance our customer's experience at<br>every step.<br>
For the full year, we were disappointed in the performance of our health care indirect channel, which is our legacy uniform business selling primarily<br>to laundries and dealers. This business has experienced a lot of consolidation in the past 2 years. It is also an extremely competitive environment,<br>in fact, our most challenging environment from a pricing standpoint. Particularly during the second half of the year, pricing pressure in the<br>marketplace pushed some prices so low that we chose simply not to chase certain opportunities that would not have met our profit goals. In the<br>end, this sector was up in Q4, making up for most of the decline earlier in the year, and we have implemented some new strategies that are already<br>yielding positive results.<br>
Our direct health care business continues to perform well. We continue to diversify in this market, expanding opportunities in the medical college<br>sector and further deepening our relationships with key integrated delivery networks. We are recovering more opportunities in long-term care<br>and in other direct channel areas that don't have the same pressure as the indirect channel. While the direct channel is not the largest portion of<br>our health care business, it certainly is the fastest growing.<br>
Looking ahead, we do expect to see some margin pressure from several sources. In some of the regions that we operate, we have seen significant<br>mandated wage increases. We are also seeing increases in the prices in many of the components of fabric and trends, particularly from China,<br>where the government is forcing many textile plants to spend heavily on environmental compliance. Their increased costs in turn drive up our<br>prices. Fortunately, our broad footprint and operating scale helped to somewhat mitigate the impact of those pressures.<br>
We have explored expanding our factory in Haiti beyond the 300 operators currently in place to ultimately accommodate as many as 450 operators<br>producing multiple product lines. We are in the process of moving forward with some of this capacity expansion, which will increase our production<br>capability beyond what it currently is.<br>
In the fourth quarter, we finished the build-out of our start-up remote distribution facility in Sparks, Nevada that will allow us to provide shorter<br>delivery times to customers in the Western U.S. The small investment and more nearby distribution is meant to create higher satisfaction from<br>current customers, but also to help gain new customers we can serve on a more timely basis. We will call this experimental at this point and look<br>forward to reporting more after we have had more time to judge its impact.<br>
Looking at BAMKO, our branded merchandise segment. Net sales increased a remarkable 79.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 2016 and 54.2%<br>for the year. This included one month of sales from the December 1 acquisition of Tangerine Promotions, a promotional products and branded<br>merchandise agency that serves some of the best-known brands in the world. Tangerine is one of the leading providers of point of purchase and<br>point of sale merchandise in the country.<br>

<A name=9></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 7:00PM, SGC - Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call<br>
Additionally, earlier in the year, we acquired Public Identity, a small yet niche-oriented company, which provides us with an entr�e in collegiate<br>license products. Both of these acquisitions are expected to be accretive to results in 2018.<br>
Tangerine and Public Identity have become true partners in supporting the BAMKO mission. Our Promotional Products segment has gained a<br>larger geographic footprint, new market segment penetration, new product lines, expanded channel distribution and new customers. The<br>management teams of all of our companies have been meeting regularly to strategize and capitalize on cross-selling opportunities in other segments<br>and using the benefits of our larger share organization.<br>
To give a couple of examples of where we have worked together to try to take care of all the synergistic benefits of our large organization, BAMKO,<br>for instance, has been able to take advantage of our Arkansas warehousing facilities for their customers who want their products stored, staged<br>and distributed. As a result of having this capacity and capability, BAMKO and Tangerine are able to take on more business that would have been<br>out of their reach prior to being acquired by us.<br>
Public Identity has partnered with The Office Gurus using El Salvador outreach team to drive additional sales opportunities. BAMKO in India is good<br>doing a good share of our customized Web development, which has already been rolled out for some of HPI's customers and has received very<br>favorable results. This is just a few of the dozens of synergistic benefits that we're realizing from our current structure.<br>
Let's speak about The Office Gurus. The Office Gurus had an exceptionally strong quarter with revenues up 51.2% and reported a 61.2% increase<br>in net sales to outside customers. The Office Gurus continues to broaden its footprint. And as we grow, we will expand the infrastructure ahead of<br>anticipated strong demand.<br>
In 2017, our call center in Belize added 150 seats. We have signed a lease on another facility in Belize, where our target is to add another 250 to 300<br>agents. Because of our success at accelerating ourselves, we are also currently exploring the Caribbean, Central and South America to determine<br>where to best place our next call center. By the end of the fiscal 2017, the total employee headcount in this segment was nearly 1,200.<br>
Segment growth has come from new customers as well as gaining deeper penetration into our existing base. The Office Gurus services our entire<br>organization as well, and we continue to leverage SG&amp;A across segments and capitalize as much as we can on synergies and cross-selling opportunities.<br>
Shifting a little bit now to the macro environment. From our perspective and what many economists are saying, we can expect more inflation<br>driven by full employment, which will result in wage increases. And with that, we can expect to see higher employee turnover. Unemployment<br>has been at or below 5% for more than a year as more people have returned to the job market and hiring has maintained momentum. The<br>unemployment rate is currently 4.1%. Some might call that full employment.<br>
Additionally, we believe uncertainty around health care should be behind us at this point as fully formed have not seen to be within reach and<br>we're seeing some uptick in activity. We also believe that with the tax benefits many companies were given, not only have bonuses been given<br>out, but we expect that there will be rebranding, upgrading of uniforms and more acquisitive activity. These all spell an increase in demand for<br>uniforms and promotional products.<br>
As it gets harder to hire for entry-level call center positions in the U.S., we also see our call centers abroad benefiting greatly from the higher wages<br>and shortages here. To sum it up, we see the employment wage picture in the U.S. being very positive influence on our near future.<br>
I'll now turn the call over to Andy to review our financial highlights.<br>
<b>Andrew D. Demott</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - COO, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. We filed our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 this morning. So I'll limit my<br>review to key income statement highlights for the quarter and fiscal year period. Let's begin by looking at fourth quarter highlights.<br>

<A name=10></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 7:00PM, SGC - Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call<br>
As Michael mentioned, net sales for the quarter improved 12% to $72.4 million versus $64.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Segment<br>contributions include Remote Staffing Solutions accounting for 3.4% as Promotional Products segment contributed 9.8% of the net sales gain. Our<br>uniform segment partially offset these gains with a decrease of 1.2%.<br>
We had another strong quarter of gross margin improvement with consolidated gross margins up to 35.8% compared to 34.1% 1 year ago. Our<br>margin performance speaks to our methodical efforts to improve operational efficiencies and diversify revenue while gaining economies of scale<br>across our segments.<br>
SG&amp;A expenses increased 18.2% to $18.9 million. As a percent of net sales, SG&amp;A was 26.1% compared with 24.8% in the same quarter of last year.<br>Income from operations increased 16.5% to $7 million. This gave us a 9.7% operating margin compared with 9.3% for last year's fourth quarter. In<br>our view, operating margins offer the best clarity as related to our overall profitability.<br>
Earnings before taxes on income increased by 16% in the fourth quarter. However, our quarterly net income results decreased 57.6% to $1.8 million<br>as a result of accounting for the tax reform act. The net impact of the tax act was an increase in our tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2017 of<br>approximately $4 million or $0.26 per diluted share. After we review the full year results, I will go through the impact of the tax reform act in more<br>detail.<br>
On a diluted per share basis, earnings for the quarter were $0.12 per share compared with $0.30 a year ago. We also paid a regular quarterly dividend<br>of $0.095 per share.<br>
On a year-over-year basis, for the full year, net sales were up 5.6% to $266.8 million versus $252.6 million in the prior year. The increase in net sales<br>was driven by our March 1, 2016, acquisition of BAMKO and our 2017 acquisitions of Public Identity and Tangerine Promotions contributing 6%.<br>The Remote Staffing Solutions segment contributed 1.9%, and this was partially offset by a decline of 2.3% contributed by the uniform segment.<br>
Sales for the uniforms or related product segment declined by 2.7% when compared to the prior year, primarily due to the loss of the large customer<br>in 2016 discussed earlier. The net sales impact from this customer was a total of $4.6 million, which includes the partial offset from the sale of their<br>remaining inventory commitment in the second quarter. We also experienced a negative sales impact of approximately $2.9 million from the<br>elimination of 2 large promotional uniform programs from a customer that elected not to repeat that part of their business.<br>
Remote Staffing Solutions revenues increased 28.2% with net sales to outside customers increasing by 33.7%. Significant market penetration in<br>2017 accounted for the continued sales improvement. Promotional Products sales increased 54.2% in 2017, totaling $42.9 million and represented<br>16% of total sales. Organic growth in this segment was just over 15% in 2017.<br>
Consolidated SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales was up slightly at 26.9% of sales for 2017 versus 26.2% in 2016. Of note, in the Promotional Products<br>segment, SG&amp;A expenses included approximately $1.1 million of acquisition-related expenses in 2016 and approximately $0.3 million for 2017.<br>
During 2017, we sold our original call center building in San Salvador. The sale generated net proceeds of approximately $2.8 million and resulted<br>in a pretax gain of approximately $1 million. Operating income exclusively gained on the sale of the call center building increased by 19.2% to<br>$24.5 million and came in very strong at 9.2% for 2017 versus 8.1% for 2016. Excluding acquisition-related expenses, our operating margin would<br>have been 9.3% in 2017 and 8.6% in 2016.<br>
Now let's take a look at the slides, which will elaborate on the tax impact as there are several components. As you're well aware, on December 22,<br>2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law and among other things, reduces the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% from a previous maximum<br>rate of 35%, creates a hybrid territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on previously differed foreign earnings, requires companies to<br>pay minimum taxes on foreign earnings in excess of specified amounts and subject certain payments from U.S. corporations to foreign-related<br>parties through additional taxes.<br>
First, as a result of the change in the U.S. tax rate, we were required to remeasure our net deferred tax asset. This resulted in a reduction of our net<br>deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase to our provision for income taxes of approximately $1.8 million in the fourth quarter.<br>

<A name=11></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 7:00PM, SGC - Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call<br>
Next, we've recorded a reasonable estimation of our tax liability related to repatriation tax and the corresponding increase in our tax provision in<br>the fourth quarter in the amount of $1.4 million, which we actually -- which will actually be paid over the next 8 years.<br>
Additionally, as a result of a change in taxation on earnings of foreign subsidiaries, we now anticipate repatriating previous and future earnings<br>from our El Salvador operation where historically, we consider that income to be permanently reinvested. We are subject to certain withholding<br>taxes in El Salvador when we dividend income out of the country.<br>
Based upon our intention in the past, the way these earnings in El Salvador, we have not previously recognize any tax liabilities associated with<br>those earnings. This change has resulted in the increase on our deferred tax liability and the corresponding increase in our tax provision in the<br>fourth quarter of approximately $0.7 million. The net impact to the Tax Act was an increase in our tax provision in the fourth quarter of approximately<br>$4 million or $0.26 per diluted share.<br>
Overall, the company's effective income tax rate in 2017 increased to 39.4% versus 26.4% in 2016. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act increases or partially<br>offset by an increase in the benefit of foreign sourced income of 1.4% and an increase in the excess tax benefit associated with share-based<br>compensation totaling 2.8%.<br>
Moving forward on a consolidated basis, we do believe the act will have a positive impact on our effective tax rate from the lower U.S. federal rate.<br>However, this benefit will be partially offset by the GILTI tax on global intangible low tax income on our foreign earnings.<br>
Additionally, we have the ongoing 5% withholding tax that will accrue as we now intend to dividend earnings out of El Salvador in the future. Our<br>El Salvador operations had a previous tax rate of almost 0 and will now have an effective rate close to 15%. Our Belize location, which also previously<br>had an effective rate of 0, should now have an effect of rate close to 10%.<br>
Finally, net income for the year rose 2.6% to $15 million in spite of the $4 million charge associated with the tax act. Diluted earnings per share<br>were $0.99 versus $0.98 in the previous year with 2017 diluted earnings shares have been reduced by 26% -- by $0.26 per share by the tax act.<br>
In order to take advantage of the higher tax rate in 2017, we made $4 million in additional contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in<br>December. As a result, we do not expect to have to make any significant payments to fund these plans over the next several years. Our financial<br>condition remains very healthy supported by free cash flow and ample liquidity to fund our future growth, and we are well fortified with our capital<br>structure as we continue to execute against our long-term growth plan.<br>
Before turning the call back to Michael, I want to touch on the anticipated financial impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard, ASC<br>606. A significant portion of our net sales come from the sale of customized products to our customers. Due to the long lead times associated with<br>our supply chain, we also carry a significant amount of this customized product in our inventories for our uniform segment and to a lesser extent,<br>our Promotional Products segment. Much of this customized inventory qualifies as specialized inventory with no alternative use and is covered by<br>our customer's contractual obligations to purchase this merchandise on an ongoing basis and to ultimately take all of this inventory at the end of<br>the related contract.<br>
Historically, the company has recognized revenue for these products when they were shipped to the customer and title had passed. As a result of<br>the new accounting standards, any such product that is in our inventory at the end of each accounting period will be recognized in net sales and<br>a contract receivable will be recorded. The initial adoption of this standard, which will be recorded effective January 1, 2018, will result in an increase<br>in our retained earnings on that date in the range of $10 million to $15 million.<br>
On an ongoing basis, we don't expect that the new standard will have a significant impact on our operating results as we would expect to record<br>a similar amount of contract receivables for products on hand at the end of each quarter in the future. However, given the nature of our business,<br>this new accounting standard could have significant impact relative to the timing of recognition of sales on new uniform rollouts and significant<br>promotional product orders in the future. Essentially, it will be expected that certain new large rollouts could be recognized in revenues 1 to 2<br>quarters earlier once the new inventory is actually received.<br>

I'll now turn the call back to Michael for his closing remarks and a general outlook for the remainder of the year.<br>
<b>Michael L. Benstock</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - CEO &amp; Inside Director<br>
As we talk about our strategy from future growth, we are very focused on all areas of our business, where we are not only leveraging synergies to<br>segment operations, but also strengthening our brand and marketing capabilities to create more integration where appropriate, with the ability<br>to leverage our installed customer base and capture increase cross-selling opportunities. We're making solid progress, creating a very broad and<br>deep organization that continues to serve a significantly larger customer base. Now if you'll refer to Slide 5, which, if you haven't found it, you will<br>be able to find it on our website under Investor Information.<br>
First, we'll discuss our uniform business and our updated long-term growth targets. In the past, we've provided revenue guidance for our uniform<br>business based on historical performance, which fluctuates up and down with rollouts, big wins and potential loss customers. This is the nature of<br>our business, and we do not believe the future will be much different from our history.<br>
From an organic standpoint, our compounded annual organic growth rate for the past 5-year period has been 8.1%. Our long-term target for our<br>uniform business is that we will grow organically at an average annual rate of 5%.<br>
Next, in our Promotional Products segment, 2017 is the first full year of net sales for this segment. In 2017, the segment generated organic growth<br>of 15%. We have a target of average organic growth over the next 5-year period of approximately 12%. This reflects potential for customer overlap<br>that will happen as we continue to do additional acquisitions in this segment. Additionally, we will supplement organic growth in the segment as<br>we have said in the past with 1 to 2 additional acquisitions each year.<br>
Remote Staffing Solutions growth from 2012 to 2017, all organic, was a CAGR of 41%. We expect this segment to add approximately $7 million per<br>year on average for the next 5 years, yielding an average annual growth rate of approximately 23%.<br>
Lastly, on a consolidated basis, this should give us company-wide average organic sales growth of approximately 8.5% over the next 5 years. Of<br>course, we also intend to supplement this growth as we have said time and time again with additional acquisitions as they play a large part in our<br>strategic growth.<br>
As I mentioned earlier, we expect BAMKO to continue to seek out strategic and accretive acquisitions. On the uniform side, we continue to nurture<br>our pipeline of acquisition candidates. As we have described in the past, they will likely be more sporadic than the promotional segment.<br>
In conclusion, we've had a strong year that positions us well for the future. A solid balance sheet and expected cash flows from operations enables<br>us to continue to preserve growth through acquisitions and other investments that leverage our strengths and are strategically aligned with our<br>core business vision.<br>
We are executing well against our strategic plan that combines diversification and integration. Through acquisitions and organic growth, we are<br>a much broader, deeper and certainly, more valuable organization than we were just a few years ago. We will now open up the call for questions.<br>

<A name=13></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 7:00PM, SGC - Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Kevin Mark Steinke</b> - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
I wanted to start out by asking about -- you've been talking in the last couple of quarters about uncertainty in the political environment, regulatory<br>environment, causing customers to hold back on spending a bit. And as you mentioned though, we've gotten clarity on tax reform, health care<br>reform seems to be kind of in the rearview mirror or unlikely to change anytime soon. So are you starting to hear from your customers a greater<br>willingness to spend? You mentioned seeing a bit of a pickup in activity, but I'd be interested in any more anecdotal evidence you're seeing out in<br>the marketplace on perhaps some increased spending plans.<br>
<b>Michael L. Benstock</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - CEO &amp; Inside Director<br>
The sense I get is this, that, yes, tax and health, those aren't questions. But we saw the market a couple of weeks ago a little crazy. So certainly,<br>investors look to -- are seeing some uncertainty out there. I don't see it. I think our customer base is extremely optimistic. Everybody realizes that<br>there will be some wage inflation. So there is a lot of efforts being made from a technology standpoint to stem the need to have -- to hire a lot of<br>additional people. But additional people isn't -- will drive us more than turnover will. And there will be turnover and higher wages will definitely<br>create that. The full employment picture helps with that as well at this point. I'm feeling very good, and I think our customers are. I meet with each<br>of our presidents every single week. We have -- or today, I've met with a couple as well earlier in the week. And they're all feeling very optimistic.<br>Their pipelines are as strong or stronger than they've ever been. As I said earlier in my remarks, maybe I didn't say it, we're having only bigger --<br>more opportunities and bigger opportunities are coming our way. And when I say are coming our way, we're seeing RFPs. We're seeing -- people<br>asking us to bid on certain things or just give them pricing, existing customers and new customers than we've seen in a long, long time. More<br>customers and bigger opportunity. We're a bigger company now, so maybe our view is that we can handle bigger opportunities as well now and<br>we're more open to that. So I think the future looks pretty good. I'm not concerned about inflation. Inflation, that will tend to work its way through<br>any organization without setting higher wages or suppliers having higher wages. Therefore, we're going to have to be passing price increases on<br>to customers ultimately. A lot of our contracts, most of them allow us some latitude in that respect. And we've done a great job on the sourcing<br>side of our business. So I'm not -- I feel we can offset whatever happens from an employee share standpoint by using the large organization now<br>to leverage our strength with our suppliers. So I'm not concerned at all. It's been a very -- pretty robust economy going on finally, and I see it only<br>getting better.<br>
<b>Kevin Mark Steinke</b> - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Okay, great. And just following up on that line of thought there, you had talked about in your prepared comments potential margin pressure from<br>wages, fabric, et cetera. But from what you're saying, it sounds like you can -- and pretty much handle that, pass on price increases. But at the same<br>time, it makes sense to explore other alternatives, new sourcing relationship or expanding in Haiti. I mean, so I guess, you're not feeling like, &quot;Hey,<br>we can't handle the inflation out there, and we're going to continue forward kind of as we have been.&quot; I mean, is that fair to say?<br>
<b>Michael L. Benstock</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - CEO &amp; Inside Director<br>
That's a very fair statement, yes. And you also have to keep in mind, what we have that most of our competition doesn't have is we have quite a<br>large office in China with over 75 people who are managing relationships for BAMKO and now for Superior in many, many factories. We've got a<br>terrific sourcing group here in Florida that doesn't spend much time in Florida, that's -- quite frankly, who spend most of the time traveling the<br>world. But the kind of hands-on sourcing that we do versus what other people does is a very, very different animal. And because we're there, I<br>mean, we're not locked into a particular situation. In fact, I'd say, yes, a factory -- a mill might be having issues with compliance and it's have to<br>spend money or shut down. But we're not just dealing with one mill. We've got so many sources there for textiles and for sewing our uniform<br>products and for BAMKO producing their products. I worry less and less for us. I think it puts us to an advantage to our competition as opposed to<br>otherwise.<br>

All right. If I could just boil it down here. In terms of your business model as it is today and the improvements you're going to continue to make,<br>the initiatives you have in place, do you feel like the business is well positioned to continue achieving some margin expansion in 2018 and growing<br>the operating income line faster than your sales?<br>
<b>Michael L. Benstock</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - CEO &amp; Inside Director<br>
I'll take a stab at that and then I'll throw it over to Andy. The -- as we continue to use the synergistic benefits of all of our shared services within the<br>organization and cross-selling and everything else, from an operating margin standpoint, I'm fairly confident that we will be working really hard<br>to improve that. On the other side, on the gross margin side of product margin, we could see some increase -- we could see some decreases in our<br>gross margin. But I'll let Andy -- he's modeled this out 25 different ways, and I'll let him jump in at this point.<br>
<b>Andrew D. Demott</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - COO, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
Yes. I mean, generally, we don't give a lot of guidance going forward. But what I will say on our -- from an operating margin perspective, you have<br>to be a little bit careful whenever you look in 2018 on a percentage basis, something we did do a nice acquisition on the promotional side right at<br>the end of the year, beginning of December. And as you know, our Promotional Products business does outrun at a lower operating margin to<br>date. They are -- we do expect that margin will continue to improve as they grow. But with them being a larger portion of the mix, that could weigh<br>on the overall operating margin just a little bit. I don't think it will have a tremendous impact on it. I think that we continue to look at -- really, we're<br>not looking just at the gross margin. We're look at the operating margin together, and we still expect positive momentum in that area.<br>
<b>Kevin Mark Steinke</b> - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
All right, fair enough. The -- can you talk about -- in the quarter, specifically, I mean, gross margin was up, but also SG&amp;A was up as a percentage<br>of sales. Was that due to business mix as you generally talk about some business can have higher gross margin but also higher SG&amp;A? Or what was<br>the dynamic going on there in the quarter?<br>
<b>Andrew D. Demott</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - COO, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
Sure, on a consolidated basis, there were a couple of things. In last year's fourth quarter, we had a gain on a settlement. It was about just under<br>$0.5 million. Obviously, that didn't repeat this year. And then in this year's fourth quarter, we're probably close to $300,000 of acquisition-related<br>expenses. So those items alone are about $800,000 of SG&amp;A in the quarter. The other side of it is really just tied to a mix of customers. You saw the<br>significant increase in the gross. There were some offsetting increase in the SG&amp;A associated with servicing those accounts.<br>
<b>Kevin Mark Steinke</b> - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
All right, perfect. Could you just touch on the benefits you expect to see from integrating HPI and Superior I.D., I guess, both from a cost perspective<br>as well as your ability to sell to the market?<br>
<b>Michael L. Benstock</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - CEO &amp; Inside Director<br>
Sure. We've -- HPI has been driving our sales now for a couple of years. But since we purchased them, actually, for the markets that they serve --<br>and we let our -- we just, on the Superior I.D. side, work towards maintaining the business we have. They -- 2 business operate with 2 presidents.<br>They -- once that's combined, they'll be one. The 2 business operate on 2 IT platforms. When this is done, they will operate on one. Because of that,<br>they operate essentially with 2 web platforms. We'll be able to operate with one. So a lot of the cost of IT and web development or the redundant<br>cost will go away. And they operated 2 marketing departments. And just about -- mostly everything else is on a shared service basis. It will be a<br>

much strong organization and a more efficient organization once they're put together. And that won't be completed -- finished in total, we're<br>expecting, the end of first quarter 2019. Most of the work will get done this year, and a lot of the benefit we should see towards the end of the year.<br>
<b>Kevin Mark Steinke</b> - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Okay, great. Just -- could you just dig a little bit more into the 5-year growth targets that you issued there. Slight, slight tick down in the uniform<br>side and the Promotional Products side, but a dramatic increase in the growth target, at least on an annual revenue added basis, for Remote Staffing.<br>So can you just delve a little bit more into the thinking behind the tweaks to each of the 3 segments, which -- obviously, it still rolls up into basically<br>the same organic growth on a consolidated basis you were targeting before, but just trying to dig into the 3 different elements there.<br>
<b>Andrew D. Demott</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - COO, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
Sure. I mean, first off, and let me clarify. It's not quite the same target. We were at 8% consolidated before. Now we're at 8.5%. I think when we look<br>at it, we're a much -- when we first started giving this guidance probably a couple of years ago, we weren't nearly as large as are today. So part of<br>the impact is that we're a large organization, so it takes more dollars to get a higher percentage. Also, just looking at the uniform segment and<br>kind of where it's been, we really felt more comfortable in that arena with the 5% number. I think it still got healthy target for what we're trying to<br>get to. And I'll make sure -- Michael will probably add a little more color on that when I'm done. But on the promotional side, there, we -- again,<br>we're, on a pro forma basis, at the end of this year, we're basically double the size we are right now. To try and continue to grow that at 15%, one<br>of the things we find as we buy these companies and we buy more. There will be a little more overlap on the customers that are there. So you won't<br>be able to -- you may be cannibalizing a little bit of what would have been the organic growth. We feel very comfortable with that 12% number<br>on a go-forward basis. On The Office Gurus business there, I mean, we have had tremendous momentum with the change we made at the sales<br>organization a year ago as well as the -- quite honestly, a lot of us, the word-of-mouth and the positive impacts we've had on our existing customers.<br>Many of our customers have grown tremendously with us. We're capable at this stage of being able to handle a lot more business in that area. And<br>we're, quite honestly, we're turning some business away just to make sure that we're taking the right business and being -- what's the most profitable<br>business for us to handle as we go forward. And I mean, we feel -- again, we feel comfortable with that $7 million a year. And we're still giving that<br>one. I mean, that shows a percentage there. But obviously, the percentage growth is coming down because of the fact that, that organization --<br>that level of growth each year is making that $7 million a smaller percentage. That's when you get down to that 23% over time.<br>
<b>Kevin Mark Steinke</b> - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Okay. All right, that's helpful. So just want to ask a little bit about Tangerine. And how would you characterize their customer base in terms of the<br>industries they serve? I mean, is it -- do they have a strong mix of retail, consumer products? What's really the areas that they're strong in, in terms<br>of that kind of POS and point-of-purchase offering that they have?<br>
<b>Michael L. Benstock</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - CEO &amp; Inside Director<br>
Yes. Their primary customer are other businesses who are looking for point-of-sale display, the signage, for their businesses. And I just got back<br>from the PPAI show not very long ago, about a month ago, where we had all of our different companies out there, probably one of the largest<br>groups out there. And I could tell you that their reputation is stellar when it comes to what they do and that they're considered a thought leader<br>and deal with some of the largest spirits companies in the country, doing much of their point-of-sale work. They still have a pretty diversified<br>portfolio in -- below that or below the spirits is definitely an (inaudible) and a signage of point-of-sale is definitely an issue. Even though -- they do<br>some of the same traditional work that makes up a small part of what BAMKO, the company we bought about a year ago, does as well. And as they<br>all -- probably every acquisition we do, we'll have some niche or some strength that will also still -- 20% to 30% of their business will still be in the<br>traditional ad specialty work. We really created -- get for ourselves, if I can explain it. I wouldn't like to say we're a French player in the promotional<br>products that's going to (inaudible) we are one of the few companies who has the ability to customize and actually work with some of the best<br>brands in the world on developing the unique promotional product for them and -- which makes us different. And that's what made BAMKO<br>different and that's what makes Tangerine different from the other 22,000 companies out there who are in the promotional products world. And<br>

what we're finding is that as we're looking at other companies, even from an acquisition standpoint and just from a competitive standpoint is that<br>it really is a very strong selling point. There's not -- everybody wants what everybody else has. And we're finding that our customization capabilities<br>are even greater than we can imagine compared to other people when we look at other acquisitions. And that everybody we look at would love<br>to have the same capabilities that we had. Look, at the end of the day, the standard mugs and cups and pens and drinkware and all that, my own<br>sense is that and what -- a lot of the smaller promotional companies were embedded to the Amazon effect because Amazon ultimately could figure<br>out how to do that and how to screen print that and how to logo that and everything else. And -- but that's not really our business. That's the --<br>our business is much more towards the customized side. And that's the side we prefer to stay on. A lot less risk, much higher barrier to entry, makes<br>us much more unique when we're in front of a customer. And I can tell you, from a -- if you look at our customer list in that area, they think that<br>we're unique as well. So does that answer your question?<br>
<b>Kevin Mark Steinke</b> - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Yes, it does. That's helpful. Just a couple more here. But you mentioned some pressure on the indirect health care channel and some new strategies<br>that you're going to try to implement there. Could you maybe delve into a little bit more what the strategic approach will be going forward?<br>
<b>Michael L. Benstock</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - CEO &amp; Inside Director<br>
Well, then I'd be telling all my competition what my strategies are. So no, I'd have to leave it that we have some -- we have both some sales and<br>marketing strategies as well as product strategies that will help us reach the ultimate decision makers sooner. And with our strategies, we believe<br>that we would -- they will not be able to walk away from a conversation with us. Doesn't mean they're going to buy from us, but they're going to<br>at least be a lot more interested in what we have to say.<br>
<b>Kevin Mark Steinke</b> - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Got it, got it. Makes sense. Just a couple of housekeeping questions here. Do you have the revenue contribution from Tangerine in the fourth<br>quarter?<br>
<b>Andrew D. Demott</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - COO, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
We -- I don't believe we put it into our filings. I believe it was about $2.5 million. But again, they're only -- it was less than -- it was really just one<br>month. And December is not typically one of your bigger months of the year. So you -- but we do have some pro forma information and the financial<br>is showing what they would have been for the full year, and that was about $35 million.<br>
<b>Kevin Mark Steinke</b> - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Yes, okay. And just lastly then, with all the various puts and takes going into the tax rate, you've been running at kind of this mid to high 20s rate<br>for the last couple of years, excluding what just happened in the fourth quarter. So what do you think is a fair approximation for where your tax<br>rate might average out post tax reform?<br>
<b>Michael L. Benstock</b> - Superior Uniform Group, Inc. - CEO &amp; Inside Director<br>
Sure. Look at this year's rate and we were at 39.4%. If you pull out the tax act and then also, let's pull out our excess benefit we get on our options<br>and so ours will come back to that in a minute, our rate this year would have been about 30%. The benefit from those options and SARs was about<br>another 7.2%. That 7.2% is the one that we have no way of controlling. It's all timing of when people exercise options and SARs and they disqualify<br>dispositions and we get to benefit from that. So when I look at it, without that number, when you look at next year's rate, that 30% number would<br>probably be between 22% and 24%, and then we'll get some benefit from the effects in options and SARs. Does that make sense?<br>

<A name=20></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, BCOV - Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
Thank you, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I am excited to report that we delivered a strong finish to 2017. Our fourth quarter<br>financial results exceeded our expectations. We have made significant progress on our strategic priorities, and we are well positioned to deliver<br>improved growth in 2018 and to exit the year at a double-digit year-over-year revenue growth rate.<br>
Taking a quick look at our strong fourth quarter financial results. We delivered fourth quarter revenue of $40.1 million, which exceeded the high<br>end of our guidance range. We delivered positive adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 million, which was well above our guidance range even after adjusting<br>for some onetime benefits in the quarter, which Kevin will detail later. We generated $4.2 million of positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter.<br>
We signed exciting new logo up-sell and renewal agreements with such notable brands and content providers as Adobe, AMC Entertainment,<br>Burberry, Discover, Franklin Templeton Investments, Hudson's Bay, Hugo Boss, Le Figaro, McKesson, Schlumberger, Sky NewsAustralia, Starwood<br>Hotels, Subway, Trinity Mirror and Yahoo Japan Corporation, among others.<br>
From a bookings perspective, overall, we had a very good fourth quarter, and I am pleased with how our sales organization performed. For the<br>year, we achieved double-digit annual bookings growth. Although this fell modestly short of the mid- to high-teens ACV bookings growth target<br>that we had set at the start of the year, I'm very pleased with the sales team's performance and what we achieved during the year and in the fourth<br>quarter especially.<br>
We would have been within our targeted range if we had closed the 7-figure deal, which we received a verbal commitment from the customer,<br>but is taking longer to get through their deal execution process than expected. In addition, during the year, we made an intentional choice to<br>incent our sales team to sign multiyear deals. This incentive is working. We signed 59 multiyear deals in the fourth quarter alone. By doing so, we<br>have increased our strategic importance with these customers, we are able to better plan and align on product road map, ensure healthier account<br>management relationships and lock in multiple years of committed revenue, reducing annual renewal risk and reducing or eliminating, altogether,<br>market and competitive risk until the final year of the contract.<br>
Many of our deals also include price escalators in the subsequent committed years of these contracts. We also saw, in Q4, increasing new opportunities<br>across geographies in use cases. And when we look at the state and quality of our pipeline and the productivity of our recent sales hires, we're very<br>encouraged by what we see.<br>
Retention rate is also a significant driver of future revenue growth, and we expect that it will become a tailwind in the second half of the coming<br>year as we lap the impact of the commodity pricing reset in our media business. As Kevin will describe, we remain on track with the guidance we've<br>provided for the timing and impact of our media pricing reset and its impact on retention rates. All-in-all, we are confident that our sales momentum<br>and improving retention will drive consistent double-digit revenue growth over time.<br>
We entered 2018 with strong market momentum, the best product portfolio in the history of the company and a better organized, better managed<br>and more effective sales and marketing organization. I am pleased with how the team is performing. And I believe, we will do even better in 2018.<br>I would like to share some additional specific reasons why I'm so optimistic about the business.<br>
First, in the media market, we have reached a critical referenceable mass of large OTT and SVOD offerings. You've heard us talk about a number of<br>significant rollouts in Japan and Asia-Pacific during 2017. These deployments are going very well. Several of these customers have already increased<br>substantially their investment with us to expand their offerings. And as we head into 2018, they are looking to spend even more with us.<br>
We are seeing that success begets success in this market. And we are focused in 2018 on leveraging what we've done in Japan and Asia-Pacific<br>around the world. These efforts will include the best practices that we've learned in utilizing our professional services team and industry experts<br>to engage with customers early in the process in their OTT plan design. Combining this approach with our market-leading and scalable platform<br>offerings, provides a highly differentiated go-to-market model. We see a rapidly growing pipeline of OTT and SVOD opportunities, and we feel<br>good about our ability to win these customers.<br>

<A name=21></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, BCOV - Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call<br>
Second, we've made very meaningful improvements to our sales organization. As I discussed on our last earnings call, we've completed a thorough<br>review of our entire sales team, which has led to improved and better aligned processes across the company as well as changes to existing personnel<br>and the hiring of new reps. This continues to be an ongoing process, but I believe we entered 2018 with a much stronger, better aligned, more<br>productive sales organization that is clear on how we want to go to market and how we differentiate ourselves. Let me share a couple of the<br>highlights about our revitalized sales organizations.<br>
In Q4, as we told you before, we relocated our Head of Sales from the Asia region to run the North American media sales team. Although we are<br>in early days with this change, so far this transition has gone very well. His first priorities had been to revamp how we identify and source prospective<br>customers and develop opportunities with existing customers and to ensure that we are going to market with the more strategic consultative<br>solution-based approach. We know this methodology works. And we are seeing positive early signs in this important market. He has also revamped<br>the structure and certain personnel within the team. And we are very pleased with the moves he has made. The very strong Asia sales organization<br>that he had left behind has not missed a beat.<br>
Our North American digital marketing and enterprise sales organization is hitting its stride and, in particular, had significant success in the fourth<br>quarter in growing the new logo side of the business. We are becoming more efficient in managing leads and converting them into sales. We have<br>better marketing attribution analysis, stronger insight into our sales funnel and a more tenured and stronger sales organization there as well. Our<br>EMEA sales organization also performed well in the fourth quarter, and we are now seeing dividends from the organizational moves that we made<br>during 2016 and 2017.<br>
A third reason that I'm very confident heading into 2018 is that the new product innovation that we introduced in 2017 and the features and<br>functionality scheduled to be delivered in the first half of 2018 have received very positive feedback from customers. We are seeing exciting and<br>positive trends in the market as customers increasingly look to leverage video to drive new revenue opportunities and enhance customer and<br>employee experiences. This is a sweet spot for Brightcove as our expanded product portfolio positions us well to take advantage of these market<br>trends and increase the strategic value we deliver for customers every day.<br>
For example, our new Enterprise Video Suite brings together a collection of internal communication tools that enterprises can use to engage, to<br>train and to interact with their employees. As Millennials become a growing part of the workforce, enterprises need new tools that resonate and<br>engage with this demographic. And as we all see every day, that is taking the form of video.<br>
With Brightcove EVS, enterprises can easily deploy video in a secure and efficient way as a core part of employee training, onboarding, compliance<br>testing, group meetings and other forms of communication. We're seeing strong customer demand for Brightcove EVS, which represents our<br>biggest push to date in the internal enterprise communications market.<br>
A great example of the opportunity for Brightcove EVS is our win this quarter with Subway, the world's second-largest fast-food restaurant. Subway<br>chose Brightcove's Enterprise Video Suite to deploy internal training to reinforce brand standards and to improve their internal communications<br>for their employees and franchise owners around the world. Subway chose Brightcove after a competitive sales process. We were successful due<br>to the power and scalability of our platform, our reputation in the marketplace and our high-quality integration with Sitecore.<br>
As another example of demand for our expanding product portfolio, our new Live offering is also seeing very significant customer interest, which<br>we expect will only grow with an updated release of that product scheduled for the first half of 2018. Compelling live content is proving to be one<br>of the most effective ways to engage consumers and to attract attention in an increasingly crowded and diverse entertainment market. Customers<br>are looking for solutions that are easy to use, highly scalable, reliable and cost-effective. These are the core tenants of Brightcove's Live offering.<br>
Yahoo Japan Corporation is a great example of a long-standing Brightcove customer, which, in Q4, substantially grew its relationship with Brightcove<br>by choosing Brightcove Live for its high-scale news programming and for other live content to be displayed on Yahoo! News.<br>
An exciting industry recognition of our product leadership and success in the video market is Brightcove's inclusion just this past week in Fast<br>Company's list of the Top 10 Most Innovative Companies in video for 2018. This is a tribute to our whole team, of which I'm very proud, and is also<br>a testament to our heritage as an innovation and productive-driven company. Innovation is and has always been at the core of our DNA.<br>

<A name=22></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, BCOV - Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call<br>
A fourth reason why I am confident heading into 2018 is that, as excited as I am about our successes in the field and in continuing to develop<br>market-leading products, I am equally pleased with the commitment that I've seen across the company in ensuring that we execute and operate<br>efficiently and profitably. We've instilled across the company a more rigorous process to identify and to decide upon investment opportunities.<br>
As demonstrated by our fourth quarter results and indeed by our second half results, we are laser-focused on achieving the financial targets that<br>we set for ourselves and for our investors. As Kevin will review later, we will return to full year adjusted EBITDA profitability and to positive free<br>cash flow in 2018, which is an important first step. We will continue our focus in this regard throughout the year. We've already commenced a<br>detailed review of our cost structure to seek opportunities to drive future margin expansion, including, but not limited to, looking at ways to drive<br>increased efficiencies from our infrastructure as we grow. Our senior executives from our product, engineering and finance organizations are all<br>deeply involved in this process.<br>
We will also continue to look for ways to drive efficiencies across our operating expense structure in our organization so that we can increase<br>operating leverage, while still driving accelerating product innovation and improved sales growth. I want to be clear that, along with accelerating<br>growth, enhancing our margin profile is a top strategic priority for the company.<br>
In summary, Brightcove ended 2017 with strong financial and operating results. We believe we have positioned the company for accelerating top<br>line growth and profitability in 2018 and beyond. We are committed to executing on our strategy for the year and for delivering value for our<br>customers and shareholders. We are confident that our investments in our products and go-to-market teams will enable Brightcove to build upon<br>our market leadership position.<br>
With that, let me turn the call over to Kevin to walk you through the numbers. Kevin?<br>
<b>Kevin Rhodes</b> - Brightcove Inc. - CFO<br>
Thank you, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. As Andy mentioned, we delivered a strong close to 2017, and we are setting up well for 2018.<br>
I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'll finish with our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2018.<br>
Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $40.1 million, $300,000 above the high end of our guidance range. Breaking revenue down further,<br>subscription and support revenue was $36.9 million, which was up from $36.1 million in the year-ago period. Professional services revenue was<br>$3.2 million in the quarter and was up from $2.5 million in the year-ago quarter.<br>
On a geographic basis, we generated 58% of our revenue in the North America during the first (sic) [fourth] quarter and 42% internationally. Breaking<br>down international revenue a little bit more. Europe generated 16% of our revenue and Japan and Asia-Pac generated 26% of revenue during the<br>quarter. Japan and Asia-Pac continue to be strong markets for us come as we won several more large deals during the quarter.<br>
From a vertical market perspective, our media business represented 54% of our revenue in the quarter and our enterprise business represented<br>43% of our revenue, while volume business represented the remaining 3%.<br>
Let me now turn to the supplemental metrics we share on a quarterly basis. Our recurring dollar revenue retention rate in the fourth quarter was<br>87%, which was below our target range of low- to mid-90s. However, as we noted earlier this year, we're working through a pricing reset and<br>expected our retention rates to be lower this year. We had a number of these contracts reset during the fourth quarter. We continue to expect that<br>the full impact of the pricing reset will be between $10 million and $13 million, and it will conclude at the end of the first quarter.<br>
Our customer count at the end of the fourth quarter was 4,168, of which 2,167 were classified as premium customers. We were pleased with our<br>new customer acquisition activity during the quarter, with a net 54 new customer additions.<br>
Looking at ARPU. Within our premium customer base, our annualized revenue per premium customer was $73,000, which was up 3% year-over-year<br>and excludes our entry-level pricing for starter customers, which averaged $5,000 in annualized revenue.<br>

<A name=23></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, BCOV - Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call<br>
Looking at our results on a GAAP basis. Gross profit was $23.8 million, operating loss was $1.3 million and loss per share was $0.04 in the quarter.<br>
Turning to our non-GAAP results. Our non-GAAP gross profit in the fourth quarter was $24.5 million compared to $24.8 million in the year-ago<br>period and represented a gross profit margin of 61%. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit was driven by investments in strategic customers<br>made by our professional services team.<br>
Subscription and support revenue represented approximately 92% of our total revenue and generated a 68% gross margin in the quarter, up 160<br>basis points sequentially.<br>
Non-GAAP income from operations was $1.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to a loss from operations of $309,000 in the fourth quarter of<br>2016.<br>
Adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 million in the fourth quarter, a significant improvement compared to $800,000 in the year-ago period and well above<br>the high end of our guidance range in the quarter.<br>
During the quarter, we recognized $1.2 million of onetime expense benefits that contributed to our strong bottom line performance. This included<br>the reversal of an accrual related to a favorable tax determination in the state of Illinois as well as lower bonus expense. Even without these onetime<br>benefits, we would have been above the high end of our guidance range.<br>
Non-GAAP income per share was $0.04 based on a 35.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss per share of $0.03<br>on a 33.9 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year-ago period.<br>
Looking at our full year 2017 results. Total revenue was $155.9 million, up 4% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was $91.3 million,<br>operating loss was $19.7 million and loss per share was $0.57 based on 34.4 million weighted average shares outstanding.<br>
On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit was $94 million, loss from operations was $9 million and adjusted EBITDA was negative $4.5 million and loss per<br>share was $0.26 based on 34.4 million weighted average shares outstanding.<br>
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $26.1 million. During the fourth quarter, we<br>generated $5.2 million in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $4.2 million. After taking into account $1 million in capital expenditures<br>and capitalized internal-use software. For the full year, we used $6.4 million of cash from operations and $10.6 million of free cash flow after taking<br>into account $4.2 million of capital expenditures and capitalized internal-use software.<br>
I'd now like to finish by providing our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018. For the first quarter, we were targeting revenue of $40 million<br>to $40.5 million, including approximately $3 million of professional services revenue.<br>
From a profitability perspective, we expect a non-GAAP operating loss of $1.9 million to $2.4 million and adjusted EBITDA loss of $800,000 to $1.3<br>million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in a range of $0.06 to $0.08, based on 34.9 million weighted average shares outstanding.<br>
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2018. We expect revenue to be in a range of $164 million to $168 million. This includes approximately $11.5<br>million of professional services revenue for the year.<br>
In terms of profitability, we're expecting a non-GAAP operating loss of negative $1.5 million to income of $1.5 million and adjusted EBITDA $2.5<br>million to $5.5 million. In addition, we now expect non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.06 to income per share of $0.02 based on 35.2 million weighted<br>average shares outstanding.<br>
For cash flow, we expect full year free cash flow to be in a range of $1 million or $3 million. From a bookings perspective, we are targeting another<br>year of double-digit annual bookings growth, which reflects strong performance across business units and geographies. It's important to recognize<br>that our bookings guidance does not include the impact of our growing number of multiyear deals as well as a price escalators built into many of<br>

these contracts. Bookings are an important part of our growth story. But ultimately, improved retention will be the biggest driver of consistent<br>double-digit revenue growth we are driving towards.<br>
With that, I'll now take your questions. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&amp;A.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Tom Roderick from Stifel.<br>
<b>Jeffrey Parker Lane</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Associate<br>
It's actually Parker Lane in for Tom. I was just wondering if you could provide an update on the migration of your customer base to Dynamic Delivery.<br>I think you said about 20% last time we spoke. And what kind of value your customers are seeing out of that solution as well as the level of investment<br>you have to make to complete that process?<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
Parker, thanks for joining us, and thanks for the question and good to hear from you. We're making progress. We are approaching about halfway<br>done. We still have a lot of work to do. But it's proceeding very nicely. Customers are certainly seeing the benefits.<br>
<b>Jeffrey Parker Lane</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Associate<br>
Thanks. And then, Kevin, on the professional services side, obviously, you're indicating a little bit down on the growth rate there. So I'm wondering<br>if you can provide a little bit of color as to why that is and whether or not this is just exercising some conservative philosophy here before investing<br>for new customer growth.<br>
<b>Kevin Rhodes</b> - Brightcove Inc. - CFO<br>
Yes, sure. I mean, as we all know, we had some large service engagements last year related to some of those OTT deployments that we had. Those<br>engagements have largely started to wind down. Of course, we've got a very good pipeline of OTT and SVOD opportunities. But as you can<br>appreciate, those opportunities are a bit lumpy, unpredictable to forecast. And so at this point, we were a little bit more conservative in what our<br>revenue guide would be until we actually ink those deals.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from the line of Mike Lattimore from Northland Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Michael James Latimore</b> - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst<br>
Just on the pricing restructuring of the top 100 media customers. Are you sort of 75% all the way through that at this point? And do you expect it<br>to be 100% at the end of the March quarter?<br>

<A name=25></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, BCOV - Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
Well, thanks for joining us. Yes. As we indicated at the outset, we are on track. We expect to be done with the pricing -- media pricing reset for the<br>top customers by the end of Q1. We are right on schedule.<br>
<b>Michael James Latimore</b> - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst<br>
Great. And then from a professional services gross margin standpoint, any general guidance there? Does that kind of improve? Or do you -- is that<br>still some investments going on there for the customer?<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
Kevin, why don't you take this one?<br>
<b>Kevin Rhodes</b> - Brightcove Inc. - CFO<br>
Sure. Yes, Mike, we are largely through some investments that we had made there on the services side for some of these large deals. As you can<br>probably appreciate, there is this services component, but then there is also subscription components for those 2. And we look at that as a blended<br>deal of margin as opposed to one or the other. And so some of these did have investments, strategic investments with these customers on the<br>services side, but overall, we are pleased with the opportunity and the SVOD deals that we have overall. So I think in terms of like this year, we do<br>think we're going to get back to positive margins in services. We think that we still got a little more investment here in Q1, but not a lot. And then,<br>certainly, less than what we had in Q4 and then should be positive in Q2 and beyond.<br>
<b>Michael James Latimore</b> - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And then, I mean, the guidance implies that you're improving profitability or at least EBITDA throughout the year, is that largely tied to<br>expected revenue growth? Or do you expect to do some additional cost reductions?<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
So it's across the board. All of the elements play in. Certainly, as we described, we're excited about the results that we had in the second half of the<br>year. We feel we have some really good momentum. We are anticipating exiting the year with double-digit revenue growth. And so that certainly<br>plays a significant role. But as I also indicated, we are committed to looking at all aspects of our operating margin. We believe that there are<br>opportunities there to gain efficiencies as we scale and continue to grow. So it's both sides of the equation and all aspects of it.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha from B. Riley FBR.<br>
<b>Lee T. Krowl</b> - B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
This is Lee Krowl filling in for Sameet. First, I wanted to touch a little more color on the contracts. Definitely a positive sign that customers are signing<br>multiyear deals. But, I guess, generally, longer deals require some sort of concession. So I was curious since you did mention there is price ratchet,<br>is there any sort of sweetener or discount you guys offer in the front part of the terms in order to get them to sign these longer-term price ratcheting<br>deals? Any color there would be helpful.<br>

<A name=26></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, BCOV - Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
Sure. Thanks for joining the call and for the interest and for your question. Each deal is different. We view it as a whole. As a typical measure, we<br>won't be discounting the first year, but we certainly try wherever possible to get as much of a commitment as we can out of the totality of the<br>contract. Yes, I probably should share with you, there is a lot of value in these multiyear contracts that go beyond just the commitment. Certainly,<br>the additional years help build our backlog, and our backlog did grow year-over-year in excess of 14%, and you'll see that when our K is filed in a<br>few days. In addition, having the customers locked in for a longer period of time or I should say committed for a longer period of time, really enables<br>us to focus a number of different things. Number one, we can focus the account management dynamic and dialogue on ensuring the customer<br>success rather than be caught in an annual cycle of having a renewal negotiation. And that's really valuable. Second, with a longer-term commitment,<br>we're able to really reliably and confidently plan a product road map based upon what that customers' initiatives are. And so those are all really<br>good things for us in helping operate the business.<br>
<b>Lee T. Krowl</b> - B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Got it. And then just kind of talking about the enterprise, the mix of enterprise in media customers. In your opening remarks you kind of mentioned<br>what I would it take to be primarily enterprise customers. So as we see growth throughout the year, should we expect more growth from the<br>enterprise side, just given your ongoing traction? Or how do we think about kind of a customer growth in terms of media versus enterprise<br>throughout 2018?<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
Sure. So we look at it holistically, of course, and we are interested in growth across the board. We are very excited about the enterprise space, and<br>we've had some real success and some excitement about our enterprise offerings. The media business is also growing quite nicely. And so we've<br>got different areas of the world where different dynamics are playing out in different growth rates. And so, for example, we're seeing wonderful<br>excitement and adoption for our media products in the JPac region. In North America, we're seeing great excitement and a lot of adoption, a new<br>logo adoption in particular on the enterprise side. And so we're excited about all of it.<br>
<b>Lee T. Krowl</b> - B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Okay. And then just the last one for me. You guys mentioned one of the biggest opportunities in terms of cost savings is likely to come from the<br>infrastructure side. Is that to the extent that you guys can talk about it, is it contemplated into guidance that you guys will be driving savings<br>through infrastructure in 2018? Or is there possibility for outside to the current outlook if you guys are able to drive or maybe find more opportunities<br>to cut costs in infrastructure?<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
Kevin, I'll let you handle that.<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
Yes, I think -- I mean, our guidance contemplates everything that we can think of and reasonably forecast today. Of course, we'll be looking at areas<br>across the organization and certainly the infrastructure costs or the ability -- or the COGS, right, to deliver our service is certainly one of those areas<br>we will continue to focus on and try and drive costs out there and potential margin improvement in the future. So it's all baked in there.<br>

<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
We do believe that there are opportunities to exceed and overachieve on our plan, but we have to identify them and do the work. And so we're<br>not forecasting them yet.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Steven Frankel from Dougherty.<br>
<b>Steven Bruce Frankel</b> - Dougherty &amp; Company LLC, Research Division - Senior VP &amp; Director of Research<br>
I'd like to dig in a little bit on the recurring dollar retention rate. And I know it's going to bounce around this year or in '17 because of the media<br>repricing. Maybe could you give me some insight as to whether that was really the primary factor in Q4 that caused it to come in below normal?<br>Or were there also maybe some smaller customers that didn't renew that contributed to that number?<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
No. Thanks for the question, Steve. No, the result that you saw was driven by and exactly in line with what we were anticipating due to the pricing<br>reset. That was the fundamental driver.<br>
<b>Steven Bruce Frankel</b> - Dougherty &amp; Company LLC, Research Division - Senior VP &amp; Director of Research<br>
And in the last couple of quarters, it's been a little better than you thought. Was it just a mix of deals? Or was there anything particular about the<br>media deals that repriced in this quarter that led to this result?<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
Sure. A couple of different things. Number one, Q4 is one of our largest quarters. In fact, it is our largest quarter, and so more was up for renewal.<br>And so there was a more pronounced impact and that played an effect here. And yes, each quarter is a different mix of deals because you've got<br>different customers and contracts up. And so we did a little better than we thought and in some prior quarters. And now we got the full mix in<br>there. And so that's why this is within what we anticipated at the beginning of the year.<br>
<b>Kevin Rhodes</b> - Brightcove Inc. - CFO<br>
And Steve, I would just add that we did 90% on the full year, 87% not that far off that than it is within the $10 million to $13 million that we originally<br>said.<br>
<b>Steven Bruce Frankel</b> - Dougherty &amp; Company LLC, Research Division - Senior VP &amp; Director of Research<br>
Okay. And were overages within the normal band in Q4?<br>
<b>Kevin Rhodes</b> - Brightcove Inc. - CFO<br>
Yes, they were, about $2.4 million.<br>

<b>Steven Bruce Frankel</b> - Dougherty &amp; Company LLC, Research Division - Senior VP &amp; Director of Research<br>
Okay. And where are you in transitioning your infrastructure to drive higher gross margins on the services and on the subscription side? Or are you<br>through that transition to the cloud? Or you still have some legacy infrastructure that's coming off?<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
So we still have some legacy infrastructure that's coming off. However, the opportunities that we're looking at are -- involve more than simply<br>moving to the cloud. We are looking at all aspects of the architecture. We're looking at the relationships with our vendors across the board and a<br>number of other elements. It's not simply moving from legacy to cloud.<br>
<b>Kevin Rhodes</b> - Brightcove Inc. - CFO<br>
Yes, we feel like we're 90-some-odd-percent moved into the cloud at this point, and we've got a couple of legacy data centers that we are working<br>through to get those shut down. But it's the long tail of getting customers off some older technology that we have, that's being supported by those<br>infrastructure -- those data centers. And once we do that, we'll be fine.<br>
<b>Steven Bruce Frankel</b> - Dougherty &amp; Company LLC, Research Division - Senior VP &amp; Director of Research<br>
And given your media momentum, especially in the Far East, what would you say is that the biggest competitive roadblock you run into? Is it still<br>the DIY focus that so many media companies have?<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
So it varies within the sub-geographies and the subregions out there. But certainly the DIY mentality is something, which is sort of the largest<br>single, I'll call it, competitor that we come up against. We've had more and more success showing the value of not going DIY. And my reference<br>earlier to reaching a critical mass of referenceable deployment is relevant here that's sort of what I'm talking about, being able to show within the<br>region or within the different regions, examples of notable deployments by larger, well-known companies that are successfully outsourcing and<br>doing so efficiently and productively and are very well done execution presentation is really helping with that.<br>

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Andy Feinberg for<br>closing comments.<br>
<b>Andrew W. Feinberg</b> - Brightcove Inc. - Acting CEO, President &amp; COO<br>
Sure. So thank you, everybody, for joining and for your interest. We're really proud of the success we had in Q4 and in the second half of the year.<br>We're excited about 2018, and we're looking forward to talking to you all of you again soon.<br>

I'd now like to turn the call over to Joe.<br>
<b>Joseph W. Dziedzic</b> - Integer Holdings Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thanks, Amy. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining to hear about our fourth quarter results. I am happy to share with you another quarter<br>of continued improvement, in fact our highest sales and profit quarter since Integer was formed 2.5 years ago. But before we get into the results<br>of the quarter, I want to start by thanking all of our Integer associates for delivering another quarter of strong top line and net income growth and<br>continued strong cash flow. The teams and the manufacturing plants and everyone supporting them delivered not only strong fourth quarter<br>results but a strong 2017 as well. The positive trajectory is clear. Thank you.<br>
Now let's review our fourth quarter results. Our fourth quarter results demonstrate strong revenue growth of 8% and net income growth of 28%.<br>We've continued to generate strong cash flow from operations and paid down $129 million of debt during 2017. Gary will take you through the<br>

financials, but I want to highlight that we finished the year above our original guidance on sales and at the high end on EPS. We understand our<br>credibility with our customers is based on delivering on our commitments and it is no different with our investors.<br>
Today, we introduced our new strategy to drive accelerated sales and profit growth. Late last year, we completed a comprehensive strategic review<br>of all aspects of our business and developed our new strategy, which is focused on portfolio management and operational excellence. Within<br>portfolio management, we organized our product lines into 3 groups, which are Invest to Grow, Protect &amp; Preserve, and Improve Profitability. I'll<br>cover our strategy in more detail later in the presentation.<br>
Turning to Slide 6. Annual sales growth consistently improved throughout 2017, and we closed the year with organic growth of 5% for 2017,<br>reflecting the progress we have made to change the trajectory of our sales back to growth. Every product line improved their trajectory, either<br>going from a decline in 2016 to growth in 2017 or slowing the rate of decline. 2017 was an inflection point for Integer back to growth.<br>
Gary will now provide more discussion regarding our financial results for the quarter and the full year.<br>
<b>Gary J. Haire</b> - Integer Holdings Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon. I'm going to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results, and I will also take you<br>through our 2018 full year outlook. Consistent with prior quarters, any reference to organic when we are referring to sales excludes the impact of<br>foreign exchange and M&amp;A activity. Any reference to organic as we talk about adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS excludes<br>the impact of foreign currency gains and losses that are reported in nonoperating other income or expense.<br>
Turning to Slide 8. Here's a quick look at our results for the fourth quarter. Sales increased 7.6% organically, closing out the year with record sales<br>in our fourth quarter. In the quarter, we saw growth accelerate in all of our Medical product lines and continued double-digit growth in our<br>Electrochem business. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% year-over-year. And during the quarter, we incurred just under $1 million of losses due to<br>foreign exchange impacted by the continued strengthening of the euro versus the dollar. However, the impact is lower this quarter due to<br>restructuring actions we took to reduce our exposure. Excluding this FX impact and taking into account the foreign exchange gain in last year's<br>number, which was $3 million, adjusted EBITDA would have been up nearly 17% year-over-year. Our adjusted net income increased 28% organically<br>when you exclude the impact of the FX losses I just mentioned. Adjusted EPS was $0.96 on a reported basis and includes $0.02 related to the FX.<br>And also worth noting is that our EPS was impacted by about $0.04 from share dilution year-over-year for a total of about $0.06 from these 2 items.<br>Overall, we had a really strong finish to the year with solid execution.<br>
Now moving to Slide 9. You could see that fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income and EPS all had double-digit growth year-over-year<br>on an organic basis. Organically, adjusted EBITDA increased 17% year-over-year in the quarter. This can be attributed to our stronger sales volumes<br>as well as improved gross margin, which is -- which was up a full percentage point versus last year. Organic growth was up 28% for adjusted net<br>income and up 24% for adjusted EPS. This growth included unfavorable year-over-year impact of higher incentive compensation, which amounted<br>to about $11 million versus last year's Q4. These higher costs were driven by our stronger performance as we finished the year.<br>
On Slide 10, I want to summarize our full year 2017 results. Looking at sales, we had a strong year with 5.3% organic growth. This was led by the<br>Electrochem business growing almost 37% as well as organic growth of 9% in Cardio &amp; Vascular and almost 6% growth in AS&amp;O. This was partially<br>offset by the decline of about 2% in Cardiac &amp; Neuro. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% organically, which excludes the impact of FX year-over-year.<br>Impacting adjusted EBITDA for the year was a headwind of approximately $14 million of bonus expense or nonstock incentive compensation given<br>the improved performance versus the prior year and the company meeting its operating metrics. Adjusted net income was up 23% organically,<br>which is driven by the improved operating performance, lower interest expense and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, which was about 20% in<br>2017 versus 23% in 2016.<br>
Now looking at Slide 11. I want to compare our actual results versus our original guidance that was provided at the beginning of 2017. For sales,<br>as we have discussed, we were well above our original guidance range, driven by stronger sales than we expected in both the Medical and<br>Non-Medical business with the combination of better execution across the business and better-than-expected markets, specifically in Electrochem.<br>

<A name=33></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ITGR - Q4 2017 Integer Holdings Corp Earnings Call<br>
For adjusted EPS, we are well within the -- we are within the range on a reported basis, but we're near the high end of the range when you exclude<br>the impact of FX -- that FX had on us for the year.<br>
Now turning to cash flow on Slide 12. I want to make a few comments around our 2017 cash flow, our debt, leverage as well as give you some<br>thoughts on our 2018 outlook. As I mentioned before, we are committed to generating continued and sustainable operating cash flow as well as<br>reducing leverage. We finished the year by generating $34 million of operating cash flow during the fourth quarter for a total of $149 million for<br>the full year, and this translated into $103 million of free cash flow. Our strong cash flow allowed us to accelerate debt payment throughout the<br>year, and we repaid $129 million of debt in 2017, consisting of $98 million in accelerated payments. In addition, we reduced our leverage from 6.1<br>to 5.6 during the year.<br>
Now looking forward to 2018, we will continue to focus our -- on cash flow and reducing our leverage. We anticipate generating over $150 million<br>of operating cash flow and over $100 million of free cash flow in 2018, and we will continue to reduce our leverage with an initial goal of getting<br>below 5.0. With our strong cash flow generation and our efforts to effectively manage working capital, our near-term debt and interest payments<br>remain very manageable. We will continue to monitor markets on a regular basis and evaluate additional opportunities as appropriate, particularly<br>as we move into the back half of the year and look at our existing high-yield notes.<br>
Now turning to Slide 18 (sic) [Slide 13]. I'd like to now discuss our full year outlook for 2018. We expect 2018 full year sales growth to be between<br>2% and 5% for the year. We believe our revenue outlook appropriately balances product line growth opportunities as well as market realities and<br>our customer programs. For adjusted EBITDA, we're expecting a range of $305 million to $315 million, which will be a growth rate of approximately<br>7% to 10%. We expect 2018 full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.45, an increase of 17% at the midpoint of the<br>guidance.<br>
In addition to this guidance, I also want to provide you with some additional information for 2018. We expect capital expenditures to be in the<br>range of $50 million to $55 million for the year and depreciation and amortization to be in the range of $106 million to $108 million. Stock-based<br>compensation is expected be in the range of $10 million to $12 million for the year. And for other operating expenses, we're expecting to spend<br>approximately $10 million to $15 million, which is a significant reduction from prior years as the majority of our spending on acquisition integration<br>activities is now behind us.<br>
The 2018 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in a range of 20% to 25%, and cash tax payments are expected to be between $13 million<br>and $15 million for the year. Now in regards to the tax rate, it is very important to note that we are still in the process of analyzing the implications<br>of the new tax law. Given both the magnitude of the changes involved and that we expect further clarification with regard to the application of<br>certain provisions of the legislation, we are providing a broader range than normal and we have assumed the current target in the middle of this<br>range for our guidance.<br>
Now I want to switch gears and I will cover our product line sales results, and then I will turn it back to Joe to cover our new strategy. First, turning<br>to Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics &amp; Portable Medical. Sales growth year-over-year was up 11% in the fourth quarter, driven by a continued tailwind<br>from one customer accelerating its sales related to one of their initiatives, continued ramping up of new products as well as increased development<br>work, which can be lumpy. We expect that we will see year-over-year sales growth continue into the first quarter, resulting from the completion<br>of plant transfer activity as well as new product ramps. However, we anticipate an offsetting impact in 2018 from the one specific customer's<br>inventory management, which we expect will lead to a more modest overall growth rate for the full year of 2018. Going forward, we believe the<br>large and growing orthopedic and advanced surgical market provides us with significant opportunities to leverage our capabilities in implants,<br>instruments and arthroscopy, in particular.<br>
Turning to Slide 16. The Cardio &amp; Vascular product line has been a significant driver of top line growth for us, and we once again saw strong<br>year-over-year sales growth in the quarter, driven by continued strong demand for existing Integer-owned products and increasing demand from<br>contract-manufactured products, particularly in the areas of vascular access and peripheral vascular. The rolling 4-quarter sales trajectory continues<br>to remain strong, consistently staying in high single digits over the last few quarters, driven by the continued success of our Cardio &amp; Vascular<br>product offering in most markets. Market momentum remains strong, and we continue to have success with both large, well-established customers<br>as well as emerging and fast-growth customers. We are focusing on the faster-growing high-value segments like structural heart, peripheral vascular<br>

and electrophysiology. In addition, we are innovating in areas such as developing faster prototyping turnaround capabilities with the goal of<br>accelerating our customers' speed to market and overall success.<br>
Looking at Slide 17. Sales in the fourth quarter for Cardiac &amp; Neuromodulation stabilized during the quarter. For CRM, the market's remained flat.<br>However, our customers experienced a nice return to growth in the quarter. In neuromodulation, sales remained strong, and these products and<br>our customers continue to gain strength in the market. The rolling 4-quarter sales trend further reflects the stabilization we saw in the fourth<br>quarter. We expect to return to growth in the first half of 2018 as midyear 2017 supply constraints have been resolved and customer activity<br>continues to improve. The neuromodulation market remains a key driver of long-term growth for the product line. There are many opportunities<br>for continued growth. As the market-leading medical device outsourcer, we are focused on accelerating neuromodulation sales through the active<br>support of customers of all sizes and the design, development and manufacture of everything from components to full systems for customer<br>applications. We continue to execute on our strategy in cardiac rhythm management and neuro, partnering with customers to provide full component<br>design, development and manufacturing capability that enables success and support growth. We also believe our OEM partners and customers<br>are seeking more comprehensive, value-added solutions and supply chain efficiencies, which Integer is well positioned to provide.<br>
Now on Electrochem. Electrochem delivered another strong quarter of growth on a year-over-year basis, up 30% in the quarter, which translates<br>into 37% for the year. The product line continued to benefit from a recovering energy market as well as share gains made during the downturn.<br>Electrochem's outlook for 2018 is positive as the team executes on new business wins and continues to drive share growth and share gain initiatives.<br>However, we do not expect the same level of high year-over-year growth rates as the energy markets have reached the point of stabilization.<br>
I will now turn the call back to Joe.<br>
<b>Joseph W. Dziedzic</b> - Integer Holdings Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Before we get into the specifics of our updated strategy, I want to provide a little background on the strategic review process we went through<br>last year. Shortly after becoming interim CEO, I initiated a very structured, 3-step process to assess the strategy that was in place and determine<br>our go-forward strategy. The 3 steps were very straightforward. The first step was an external assessment of the markets we serve. This included<br>evaluations of the market size, growth rates, customers, competitors, technology trends, outsourcing trends and market share of the various<br>participants. We developed an objective view of the markets we are competing in to determine what to expect from those markets.<br>
The second step was internally focused on Integer. This step was designed to answer the simple question, what is our strategy and is it working?<br>We've reviewed the results of our current strategy to understand our revenue growth rates versus the market, our profitability versus our competitors,<br>our share of wallet with our customers, our technology position and many other success measures. The result of this review, combined with Step<br>1, shaped our new strategy.<br>
So the final step produced what you see on Slide 20. The knowledge we gained and conclusions drawn from the external and internal assessments<br>formed the basis of this strategy. The left-side groups are product lines into 3 categories: Invest to Grow, Protect &amp; Preserve, and Improve Profitability.<br>The importance of understanding these groupings is clear, what should we expect from the markets we're in given how we are positioned in them,<br>which then leads to very product line specific strategies that enable us to win. The investor growth category includes Cardio &amp; Vascular,<br>Neuromodulation and Electrochem. These markets have inherent tailwinds and are expanding. Our customers are innovating to develop new<br>treatments and procedures that grow these markets beyond the existing products. These are markets that should yield higher-growth rates, and<br>we need to invest accordingly.<br>
The Protect &amp; Preserve category consists of cardiac rhythm management, which is in a low growth end of market. Our Greatbatch-branded product<br>has been and continues to be a strong and well-positioned player in this space. We have and continued to innovate for the next generation of CRM<br>products to enable our customers to improve patients' lives globally.<br>
The Improve Profitability category contains businesses with potential -- with growth potential and includes Orthopedics, Advanced Surgical and<br>Portable Medical. These are strong businesses with differentiated capability that serve our customers very effectively, and they have significant<br>margin expansion potential.<br>

We are confident the plans we have put in place will address this margin expansion opportunity, some of which have already been implemented.<br>We have taken organizational actions that create increased senior executive focus. In November last year, we moved the Portable Medical business<br>to Jennifer Bolt, our President of Electrochem. We did this to create additional senior executive focus for both Portable Medical and the Advanced<br>Surgical and Orthopedic business. Jennifer has done an excellent job of managing the Electrochem business through a market cycle. And after<br>about 3 years in her current role, she has grown to have the capacity for a larger leadership role. The Portable Medical team has already implemented<br>both organization structure changes and headcount reductions that create greater accountability and profitability.<br>
In Advanced Surgical and Orthopedics, we have revenue growth opportunities that we are executing on, which is evident in the 6% revenue growth<br>delivered in 2017. We have already taken very specific actions within Advanced Surgical and Orthopedics to address underperforming investments<br>and increased efficiencies. Additionally, Jeremy Friedman, our COO, will shift more of his focus to improving the profitability of the Advanced<br>Surgical and Orthopedic business. I want to be clear: we are profitable and very competitive in Advanced Surgical, Orthopedic Portable Medical.<br>We have strong growth prospects in both revenue and margin expansion opportunity. We are highlighting the current level of profitability as an<br>area of significant opportunity for Integer. We highlight these opportunities so you, as investors, understand our overall strategy and where to<br>expect improvements.<br>
So I've covered the portfolio strategy and how we are thinking about each of our product lines. Now I want to cover the operational strategy. We<br>have 3 areas of focus, customers, costs and culture, and each area has 2 strategic imperatives.<br>
The first area of focus is customers, which is by design. We believe we have the technology, the manufacturing capability and customer relationships<br>to do more for our customers and win more with our customers than we currently do. In 2017, we made significant progress in growing our business.<br>We need to accelerate and then sustain this growth rate. To accomplish this, we will be committing senior executive focus on the strategic imperative<br>of sales force excellence.<br>
Market-focused innovation is the other customer strategic imperative. Innovation has been and will continue to be a critical part of the DNA of<br>Integer. Innovation drives the breadth of our offering and the customers we serve. We will continue to partner with our customers to support their<br>innovation while also being at the forefront of MDO innovation to extend the reach of our customers beyond their internal capabilities and resources.<br>
The second area of focus is costs. In addition to delivering innovative, high-quality product on time, we must generate greater efficiency in our<br>operations to increase capacity and lower cost. To accomplish this, we are initiating 2 strategic imperatives focused on manufacturing excellence<br>and business process excellence. The manufacturing excellence strategic imperative will create the Integer production system, a single manufacturing<br>approach used across Integer that standardizes and deploys consistent capabilities, tools and processes and ultimately creates an even greater<br>competitive advantage for Integer.<br>
The other cost strategic imperative is business process excellence. We have integrated many businesses over the past 5 years to become Integer.<br>Now we are taking a very structured approach to create single standard processes across all of Integer. This will generate increased efficiencies<br>and create capacity to focus even more resources to invest to grow with our customers.<br>
The third focus area is culture. Performance excellence to us is a mindset. It's about the level of performance we expect. Excellence must be the<br>standard, but excellence doesn't happen on its own. So we are developing or enhancing necessary processes and programs to create a culture of<br>performance excellence, including strategic workforce planning, performance differentiation, incentive compensation changes and high-potential<br>employee development.<br>
The long-term success of Integer is dependent on our ability to increase our leadership capability. Leadership capability is about developing leaders<br>at all levels of the company who can grow as fast or faster than Integer. It's about succession planning, individual development plans and the<br>selection process. We are committing the necessary focus and investments to building leadership capability for the long-term success of Integer.<br>
I've summarized our overall strategy and the strategic imperatives within the strategy. Now let's cover who on the executive team will lead each<br>of the strategic imperatives. But first, I have a few updates on the executive leadership team. Jeremy Friedman, our Chief Operating Officer, has<br>informed us of his intent to retire at the end of 2018. I want to thank Jeremy for his more than 10 years of service to Integer and the significant<br>

positive impact he has had on our company. I have enjoyed learning from and partnering with Jeremy over the past 11 months, and I look forward<br>to his continued partnership. As part of Jeremy transitioning into retirement at year-end, we are moving the Cardio &amp; Vascular and the Cardiac<br>Rhythm Management &amp; Neuromodulation businesses to report directly to me. This would create capacity for Jeremy to focus on 2 important<br>elements of our strategy, which are improving the profitability of the Advanced Surgical and Orthopedic business and leading our customer<br>strategic imperatives.<br>
Our new President of the Cardio &amp; Vascular business is Payman Khales, who joined us this week and brings a strong commercial and general<br>management background to Integer. I am confident Payman is the right person to lead our Cardio &amp; Vascular business as we work to accelerate<br>the cardiovascular business to double-digit growth. I want to take a moment to thank John Harris, who has been leading the cardiovascular business<br>as Interim President very well for more than a year. I am grateful for John's leadership and the progress that cardiovascular business made under<br>his guidance. John is staying with the company in his prior role of Vice President of Operations for Cardio &amp; Vascular, and he will be a vitally important<br>partner with Payman.<br>
Kirk Thor joined Integer at the beginning of the year as the Chief Human Resources Officer. Kirk brings more than 25 years of talent management<br>and leadership development expertise, and I look forward to partnering with Kirk to drive our culture of strategic imperatives.<br>
The right-hand side of this slide highlights the executive leaders who are leading the strategic imperatives. I've already mentioned that Jeremy is<br>leading customer strategic imperatives and Kirk is leading the culture strategic imperatives. The manufacturing excellence strategic imperative is<br>being led by Jennifer Bolt. Prior to the acquisition of Lake Region, Jennifer led operational excellence for Greatbatch and brings a deep manufacturing<br>background in the automotive industry. Business process excellence is being co-led by our Executive Vice President of Quality and Regulatory, Joe<br>Flanagan; and our Chief Information Officer, Mary Holler. Both Joe and Mary have deep expertise in process excellence that positions them well to<br>lead this important strategic imperative across Integer.<br>
We have a clear strategy to accelerate growth, both from a portfolio perspective and an operational perspective. The strategic imperatives are<br>clear. We have the management team in place with the recent additions of Kirk and Payman. We have clear executive ownership of the strategic<br>imperatives. More importantly, the executive leaders have deep domain expertise in the strategic imperatives they are leading. We have clear<br>financial measures of success: sales growth above the market and profit growth at least 2x sales growth, which we believe will earn a valuation<br>premium. I am confident we have the right strategy and the right team in place to deliver for our customers and to realize our vision of enhancing<br>patients' lives worldwide.<br>

I guess, first off, congratulations on presenting a very thorough and a really well-thought-out plan to grow the business. Have you had the opportunity<br>to present this to some of your customers? And I just wanted to get their first reaction to it.<br>

<A name=37></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ITGR - Q4 2017 Integer Holdings Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Joseph W. Dziedzic</b> - Integer Holdings Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
We -- I will have the chance to do that on Tuesday of next week when I'm meeting with a customer. We have just unveiled this publicly today. We've<br>been working on this, obviously, since the middle of last year internally. We've been rolling this out over the past couple of weeks. So this is the<br>first public announcement of this. So next week, on Tuesday, I'll be with a customer and I'll get some initial impressions.<br>
<b>Matthew Ian Mishan</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And on the last slide, you put clear objectives over there, and the objectives are to grow faster than the market and to earn a valuation<br>premium. What is your sense of what the market is now growing at? What has it been growing at? And then who are you trying to earn a valuation<br>premium to?<br>
<b>Joseph W. Dziedzic</b> - Integer Holdings Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Great question. So we think the markets, when you look at all of the markets that we're competing in and you aggregate them, we think it's<br>mid-single digits, maybe somewhere in the 4% to 5% range. And we're looking at this and thinking about it over a long time period, not a discrete<br>quarter or year. So as we think about over time, we're thinking 4% to 5% is the market. So we aspire to be excellent, which is above the market,<br>above average. And when we think about earning a valuation premium, there's not a lot of clear MDO public company comps. So as we look at<br>companies that we think might be similar to us on other factors, whether it's size or being in the industry but not the specific markets or we look<br>at other deals that have occurred and we look at the value, we think market for us is somewhere in the low to mid-teens in terms of multiple of<br>EBITDA. We're trading at a discount to that today, and our objective is to earn a premium. We believe if we deliver above-market growth and we<br>bring profit through at least 2x the revenue growth that, that will earn a premium.<br>
<b>Matthew Ian Mishan</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
And then how much visibility do you have to growth? I mean, do you have any idea of how much is -- of the plan of the 2% to 5% next year, how<br>much of that is new business wins or core volumes? And have you better aligned with your customers so that you're able to plan alongside them?<br>Better so than you had over like the previous several years.<br>
<b>Joseph W. Dziedzic</b> - Integer Holdings Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
So if your question is more about short-term understanding our customers' needs and their volume demands, I think we've made tremendous<br>progress in the past couple of years. And I'll specifically point to what Jeremy Friedman, our COO, has done in building that process out to work<br>with customers for our sales and operations planning process. I think we're well aligned with our customers and we understand their near-term<br>needs from a production and delivery perspective. And I think we delivered very effectively in the fourth quarter, and that was part of our success<br>in the fourth quarter. What you may be asking more of is as we look beyond 2018 and how do we earn an above-market growth rate, that's where<br>our strategic imperatives for customers comes into play. The sales force excellence is about us making sure that we're getting full value for what<br>we currently have in terms of technology, manufacturing capability and how we can support our customers' growth. I think what we have today<br>should allow us to grow at, at least the market rate, which we did in 2017. Looking backwards over time, we have it, but I think 2017, we are and<br>we expect to figure that out going forward to grow at least the market rate. And I think sales force excellence can get us there. The market-focused<br>innovation is how we get to grow above the market, above what the market rate is by partnering with our customers and bringing innovative<br>products and solutions with them -- or to them. Jeremy is going to spend the rest of 2018 focused on these 2 strategic imperatives to ensure that<br>as we go into 2019, we have clear line of sight as to how we're going to deliver above-market growth.<br>

<A name=38></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ITGR - Q4 2017 Integer Holdings Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Matthew Ian Mishan</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay, excellent. Just last question for Gary. On -- how should we -- maybe I missed it in the presentation, but how should we be thinking about<br>interest expense in 2018, especially in a kind of a rising rate environment?<br>
<b>Gary J. Haire</b> - Integer Holdings Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. It's a great question, Matt. So from an interest expense standpoint -- and I'll just stay to the cash side, the amortization of the deferred cost is<br>going to be flat. It's around $7 million. But the cash side interest, we earned about $96 million of cash interest in 2017. And as we look forward, we<br>expect the cash interest to be down just a little bit. And really, it's -- if you think about it as we have, obviously, heavy debt paydown. So we have<br>a lower balance. But certainly, the LIBOR is up. Right now, what we're modeling is about kind of a weighted average rate up around 40 basis points<br>year-over-year due to the LIBOR increases. And that's -- so that's the way I would look at it.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sidoti from Sidoti.<br>
<b>James Philip Sidoti</b> - Sidoti &amp; Company, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
If we go back 3 months and we listen to the tone on the call there, it sounded like you expected top line growth to moderate a little bit in the fourth<br>quarter. And the numbers you reported today were very, very strong. Were you surprised to see how the business grew in the fourth quarter?<br>
<b>Joseph W. Dziedzic</b> - Integer Holdings Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Jim, thanks for the question. We absolutely did see stronger demand from customers in the fourth quarter than what we were anticipating. There's<br>-- I'd say there were multiple factors that led to our outperformance in the fourth quarter versus our guidance, and it started with we executed. We<br>fulfilled everything our customer ordered and what they needed. The customer demand was stronger. You see the stronger revenues in their<br>results based on their releases. And as we were entering the fourth quarter, we were looking at 2016, and the fourth quarter of 2016 was by far the<br>biggest quarter of the year. And so as we were looking at our fourth quarter 2017 demand, to think that we were going to be 8% over the highest<br>quarter of '16 was not what we were expecting, obviously, given our guidance. So we did perform better in terms of delivery in the fourth quarter,<br>and our customer demand was better. So we feel really good about entering 2018 with the momentum we have.<br>
<b>James Philip Sidoti</b> - Sidoti &amp; Company, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
And then other than that one customer that was rebuilding some inventory in the quarter, I mean, were there any one -- any sales that you would<br>consider pulled forward or onetime in the quarter? Or do you think that...<br>
<b>Joseph W. Dziedzic</b> - Integer Holdings Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
No, there was not. In fact, the one customer, that was something we actually knew about early in the third quarter because it was a specific program<br>for something that they're working on. So we knew about that going into the third quarter. So that impact was customer driven, and it was in our<br>guidance going into the fourth quarter.<br>
<b>James Philip Sidoti</b> - Sidoti &amp; Company, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And then this is the same question I asked you 3 months ago. That was, when do you think that the declines in the CRM business will be<br>more than offset by the growth in the -- in neuro business?<br>

<A name=39></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ITGR - Q4 2017 Integer Holdings Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Joseph W. Dziedzic</b> - Integer Holdings Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I know every day we were getting more and more traction in neuro. And every day, our neuro customers continue to grow and perform well. I don't<br>know when that tipping point comes, but I want it sooner than you do.<br>
<b>James Philip Sidoti</b> - Sidoti &amp; Company, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
Well, based on your guidance for 2018, it sounds like we're pretty close.<br>
<b>Joseph W. Dziedzic</b> - Integer Holdings Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
We believe there's opportunity for us in the cardiac rhythm management business to actually make some inroads in certain segments that can<br>allow us to get some growth despite the low growth in CRM in total. So even though it's in the Protect &amp; Preserve because we're currently well<br>positioned, we do see some segments of growth opportunity. We have to go execute and deliver for our customers, which we're working on. So<br>we're not giving up on growth in CRM but we recognize the realities of that market. And in neuro, we're going to be very focused on accelerating<br>the growth there and serving the high-growth customers in that space. We don't know exactly when that tipping point is going to come, but we're<br>focused on it.<br>
<b>James Philip Sidoti</b> - Sidoti &amp; Company, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
Right. And then the last question for me is on debt paydown. It sounds like you're going to pay a little bit less debt in 2018 than you did in 2017<br>even though EPS should be greater. Is there a reason for that? Is that cash being used for investments? Or what's going on there?<br>
<b>Gary J. Haire</b> - Integer Holdings Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. Jim, it's Gary. So I think that what you're seeing is $100 million plus on the debt paydown. I don't know that I'd directly interpret that as we're<br>going to pay down less. We generated really solid cash flow in 2017. On top of the cash flow that we generated operationally or free cash flow in<br>2017, we had a couple other things that went to the debt payment, which was one, we effectively used a little bit more cash to draw our cash<br>balance down, which we think is a prudent thing and we'll continue to do. And also, we got some cash in from stock option exercises probably<br>more than a normal rate during this last year. So we had that excess cash. But I don't know that I would interpret it as we're going to reduce our<br>debt paydown from '17 to '18. Maybe it's just I'm not giving specific guidance around it just for some flexibility, but I wouldn't say that it's a change<br>in the investments. That level should be pretty comparable, as I said, on the capital investments. But I don't think you should read too much into<br>that.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to presenters.<br>
<b>Amy Wakeham</b><br>
Great. Thanks, Joey. Thanks for taking time to join our call and for your continued interest in Integer. If you have any follow-up questions, please<br>contact Investor Relations directly. Have a great evening.<br>

<A name=44></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:00PM, DYSL - Dynasil Corporation of America Annual Shareholders Meeting<br>
<b>Peter Sulick</b> - Dynasil Corporation of America - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
I hereby declare the polls open on this proposal #2.<br>
If anyone desires any discussion of the proposal, please raise your hand and wait to be recognized by the Chairman. Is there anyone who wishes<br>to vote in person? I now declare the polls closed on this motion.<br>
This concludes the time for the presentation of nominations and proposals. Ms. Kehe, please tabulate the ballots and Dynasil will report the final<br>results of this election upon receipt of the final report from the inspector of elections.<br>
This concludes the formal portion of our meeting. I want to thank all of you for attending. For those of you that wish to stay, we will now turn to<br>the management presentation, followed by a question-and-answer session.<br>
So this is my portion. We will have subsequent reports by members of our management team. You can follow along, as I mentioned previously,<br>through the website or through the webcast. Initial item that we're going to be discussing are our ongoing corporate objectives, and they are as<br>follows: continued growth in optics revenue through organic growth and opportunistic acquisitions; conversion of jobs shop revenue stream<br>across our optics companies to more predictable longer-term recurring revenue; a launch of a new business for us, called the HEAR IR business in<br>2018; launch of an optical assembly business also in 2018; third, developed technology and transfer into commercial development. This includes<br>RMD simulator technology, CLYC, Cesium iodide thin film simulation, strontium iodide and a new instrument that we developed within RMD, called<br>handheld radiation monitor. And secondly, Dynasil Biomedical, the Xcede Patch, and the intellectual property around the Xcede Patch; fourth,<br>maintain conformity with loan covenants, improve overall cost of capital through conversion to lower-cost funding where possible; fifth, capital<br>allocation to support the above objectives; and finally, sixth, focus on shareholder returns.<br>
The next slide is a brief summary of 2017 versus 2016. Revenue decreased from $43.4 million to $37.3 million. Optics revenue was the primary<br>reason for the decrease, which went from $23.7 million to $19.3 million. There was essentially one customer, and we will talk about that a little bit<br>later in the presentation. Contract research revenue decreased 9% from $19.8 million to $18 million, and we'll also have a brief description of that.<br>Net income from operations pre-Xcede, up $1,800 and $15,000 versus $2.749 million in 2016, a decrease of 70%, net loss from operations versus<br>net income from operations of 582,000 versus 2016 of $679,000.<br>
Now a brief summary of our fiscal year 2017 performance. At EMF, revenue growth of HUD, Heads Up Display business. Our Hilger subsidiary<br>continued support for Caesium iodide and lysine product development. Hilger was the entity that had a single largest loss as a result of the largest<br>customer for the year not ordering product. Happy to say that, that business has returned for 2018.<br>
RMD, significant impact from the change in presidential administration to resulting in funding issues on approved projects. Staff reductions, salary<br>rollbacks and various other activities took place between the period of April to July 2017. And I'm also happy to say that our backlog route of $37<br>million during the year, and ended at $33 million at the end of the year. We also had significant growth in our commercial revenue, which -- and<br>we're continuing to refine the commercial product pipeline, and you will hear a little bit about that during Kanai's report.<br>
On our Xcede effort, we transferred Xcede to -- we attempted to transfer the Xcede investment to the Dynasil shareholders via a stock dividend.<br>We were unsuccessful in completing this. However, we did manage to -- through a combination of funding by Cook Biotech and Dynasil insert<br>additional capital into Xcede, and we will have a brief discussion later by Linda on where we currently stand on our first significant clinical trials<br>and product development.<br>
With respect to our corporate activities, we launched 3 e-commerce websites, which are up and running as of the end of the year, with another 1<br>launched in early part of fiscal 2018.<br>
Total debt, maybe the last year we show this slide, but it shows that over the course of the last 4, 5 years, we've significantly reduced our total debt.<br>It's gone from $11.5 million down to $3 million. Early on, in that period, we had some substantive issues with debt, and we've managed to reduce<br>it down to a sustainable and manageable level, and we continue to anticipate that we will manage this closely -- year in and year out. Where we<br>can, we swap debt for lower-cost debt, where possible, and we have an effort to do that.<br>

2017 objectives, which we mentioned last year, I'd like to bring everyone up to date on exactly how we performed relative to these. First objective<br>was actively bidding on the optical assembly business, which could add both substantial revenue and profitability. For 2017, while we were bidding<br>on this business, we did not get any orders. However, in 2018, we are building a prototype assembly operation we should be launching during the<br>year, and we are hopeful of that prototype assembly generating some business for us in optical assemblies.<br>
Number 2, launching e-commerce website in specific product offerings, not otherwise available in the marketplace, as well as traditional products.<br>New e-commerce site will be Dynasil branded with sub-links to the individual company's websites. As I mentioned, we launched 3 e-commerce<br>sites throughout the year: Optometrics, EMF and Fused Silica, all under the Dynasil branded name, and Hilger was launched in early 2018.<br>
Three, Xcede, funded through first in-human trial opportunity for monetization through acquisition sale dividend to Dynasil stockholders or<br>additional financing over the next 18 months. Xcede is status quo. We were unable to divvy the dividend. However, we are actively looking at<br>financing through an investment banker and considering other options. First in-human clinical trial could begin this year, 2018.<br>
Number 4, commercial growth in revenue for RMD is expected to double this year, and again, double over the next 2 years. For 2017, our commercial<br>revenue and RMD tripled. 2018 looks like an off year. There are substantial opportunities, but the timing is conditional on government appropriations<br>and bids. Over the next 3 years, we believe the overall trajectory of the RMD commercial revenue will be significant, but individual year timing is<br>difficult to forecast.<br>
Number 5. Hilger array business expected to return to 2016 levels by the summer of 2017. CsI business, also expected to increase over the next 18<br>months. Unfortunately, the Hilger array business did not return to the 2016 levels during 2017. In fact, it dramatically dropped off. However, it is<br>beginning to pick up -- it has started to pick up in October 2018, will be ramping during the year and will be approaching the 2016 levels by the<br>end of 2018.<br>
I would like to talk a little bit about the future, the next year or so, things that we're measuring and that, ultimately, we'll report on a year from now.<br>First is launch and procure business for both the HEAR IR and optics assembly business. Next, process and equipment necessary for HEAR to be<br>procured and installed by the third quarter of 2018; continued development of a long-term strategic plan; continued support of Xcede through<br>clinical trial. Financing will be necessary during 2018. And we are going to put an increased emphasis on marketing this year, maximizing exposure<br>to products through e-commerce websites, generation of leads for sales teams, planning for and implementing the CRM system and we will be<br>hiring a VP of Marketing.<br>
So that concludes the formal portion of my report. I'm now going to turn it over to Dr. Linda Zuckerman, who's going to give us an update on<br>Xcede.<br>
<b>Linda Zuckerman</b> - Xcede Technologies, Inc. - CEO<br>
Thank you to our shareholders. It's nice to be back after a year. We've made significant progress with Xcede, and I'm happy to share that with you<br>today.<br>
We'll go to the next slide. I just want to remind that we have a pretty specific vision. We're dedicated to the development and commercialization<br>of innovative surgical products. We want to bring not just useful product, but superior products that provide value to both our patient population,<br>as well as hospital payers, and while we do that, we'll build value to our investors. We have a list of strengths, which include a deep pipeline, good<br>strategic partners and experienced management team and a strong IP portfolio.<br>
Next slide. We have had several significant accomplishments in 2017. We've transitioned the company from a startup to a clinical stage company,<br>and we have an eye for being a commercial focused company as well. We've had several patents that have been issued for our technologies, both<br>here in the U.S. and abroad. And we continue to file our applications outside of the U.S. to increase our worldwide IP coverage. We've also managed<br>our cash very well, and this has allowed us to have an increased runway to realize more of our accomplishments, and we've increased our visibility<br>in the field. There has been several potential products in licensing opportunities that we have evaluated. None of those have come to fruition to<br>date, but this has increased our visibility significantly with potential strategic partners and others that compete in the field.<br>

<A name=46></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:00PM, DYSL - Dynasil Corporation of America Annual Shareholders Meeting<br>
We've had many accomplishments over the last year. These are focused primarily around our hemostatic patch, which is our lead product. We have<br>completed our preclinical safety and efficacy testing of the patch. And we have completed with our manufacturing partner, Cook Biotech and West<br>Lafayette, our good manufacturing practice -- manufacturing process. We have recently submitted our dossier to the Medical Ethical Review<br>Committee in the Netherlands, where we're going to execute our first clinical trial, and we're waiting on recommendations from that committee.<br>There's likely questions have to be answered. And if we can overcome that hurdle, we will start our first clinical trial in 2018 and those are first<br>patient with the Xcede patch.<br>
To that end, we've undertaken many of the standard clinical activities required with doing and executing a complete clinical trial. As I mentioned,<br>we have an eye toward also being a commercial company, as well as getting our patch approved here in the United States, and we have quite a<br>long to-do list. I won't read those out loud for you, except to say that we're very diligent in thinking about executing through our activities to bring<br>value to our patients to our payers, and realize the Xcede patch as a superior hemostatic product.<br>
With that, we're also keeping an eye closely on the market, so significant market potential both here and in the European Union. We've also started<br>to think about our commercial positioning. We think we can capture significant portions of the Xcede patch market through a lower cost more<br>efficacious product. We also think that we will steal share from other segments in the market due to our efficacy and our price point. And we like<br>to think that we'll have significant pharmaco-economics benefit that will come, and we'll measure it during our clinical trials, and these will be of<br>significant interest to hospital payers. We'd like to see reductions, and we hope to see reductions in operating room time, blood products used,<br>length of hospital stay. All these help drive strong value proposition, and make the patch more attractive as a product in the commercial space.<br>
We are also acutely aware that there are significant players and forces in the market space, and we're not the only up-and-coming entrants, so I've<br>listed a few others. Some of you are based here in the U.S. Others are in Europe. We also notice there are companies that have more than 1 patch,<br>and to be successful, we would like to have a portfolio of products. For example, our sort of 400-pound gorilla, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Baxter,<br>have a line of hemostasis products, and we aspire to that, as do other products, which either have 1 or 2 products in the space. So we keep very<br>closely -- very close track of these market forces and who is doing what. And that's my concluding message to you. Hopefully, I will come back in<br>a year and show you clinical data if all continues to go according to plan. Thank you.<br>
I'd like to introduce, before I leave, Dr. Kanai Shah. He's the President of RMD.<br>
<b>Kanai S. Shah</b> - RMD Instruments, LLC - VP of Research<br>
Thank you, Linda. So good morning. And I'd like to provide the status update and recap of RMD's activities in the last year. And so in terms of fiscal<br>2017, we closed the year at about $18 million. And as Peter alluded to earlier, one of the highlights of last year was that our product sales tripled<br>over the year before. So we are on the trajectory of strong growth in product portfolio and while the timing is difficult to predict, we definitely<br>anticipate that could be a major growth area for RMD in coming years.<br>
In terms of the current budget for the FY '18 period, we are essentially expecting a similar budget to FY '17, but again, we continue to focus on<br>product portfolios very strongly. We have a pretty strong backlog at present, $30-plus million and we -- in the spring cycle, we have whole bunch<br>of bids out there, where we anticipate hearing more on the results for them. One of the major highlights of our research activity is continuing to<br>push for larger and longer projects, the idea being that, essentially, you need less projects to keep the research going, and you can have more time<br>to actually research the products. The -- in terms of product activity is we continue to engage very strongly with OEMs on several of our emerging<br>-- several of our new technologies, essentially to make sure that the pipeline for that is pretty strongly established. And we continue to have a<br>strong active portfolio. Last year, we had 6 awarded patents, and I think applications filed renewal total awarded patents to 68.<br>
Next slide please. And so with that, I'd like to kind of go into maybe a deeper dive in some of the exciting projects that are going on at RMD.<br>
Next slide. So in all of the interesting NIH funded projects sort of health-funded projects we have going on at RMD is to -- is in the area of fighting<br>and combating cancer. As -- and everybody's aware, one of the major therapies for combating cancer is radiation treatment, and the procedure<br>works by damaging the DNA in the cancer cells through the oxidation that happens in the cells. Now the tumors are bigger and some of the inner<br>core of the cancer tumors are -- don't have enough oxygen in them. That effectiveness is reduced, and so the developing nano particles, which<br>

can be injected into the patient and essentially allow removing the tumors even from this lipo cells to the oxygen is depleted because upon the<br>remission with -- the remission, these nano particles you rely which essentially fights the cancer, and early results in our early stage research have<br>been very exciting, and we anticipate this research to be exciting in coming years.<br>
Next slide please. We continue to do a lot of activities in the area of screening and combating weapons of mass destruction. So as everybody's<br>aware that's the major concern in the world today, essentially looking and tracking for illicit smuggling of highly enriched(inaudible) uranium or<br>plutonium. And the way that people discover and detect these radiations are through their gamma ray and neutron signatures, which are emitted<br>by these radioisotopes that are present in uranium and plutonium. And so RMD is funded by Defense Department, developed a stand-off detection<br>system, using our exciting CLYC scintillation technology to help in that mission. And these are somewhat the largest CLYC custody produced, which<br>are going to be hurried to develop the system. And again, for everybody's benefit, this CLYC detectors provide detection of both gamma rays and<br>neutron simultaneously, and both of them are important signatures which help us identify these illicit materials.<br>
Next slide please. Another exciting area for research that is going on at RMD is its activation of the market-tell(inaudible) infrared arrays,<br>third-generation infrared arrays, and as people in the optics suite are well aware, this market-tell (inaudible) infrared arrays are -- require stabilization<br>on the surfaces because of the semiconductor bonds being open at the surfaces. And one of the ways to do that is through activation layer of<br>keltell (inaudible) films, and RMD has developed a proprietary technology using etiment level (inaudible) deposition to deposit this keltell(inaudible)<br>films. And the important advantage that our technology brings is that these are controllable pin-hole fee (inaudible) films, which can be deposited<br>at much lower temperatures than currently thought, and that can have a big impact in the yield and in the utility of these infrared sensors. So we<br>are excited about where this area is going.<br>
Next slide please. Another exciting area of development is in the area of ultrafast x-ray imaging that we're developing at RMD. So the traditional<br>glass screens, which are used in x-ray imaging have a certain decay(inaudible) time, and some of the proprietary (inaudible) HSF screens we have<br>developed at RMD are significantly faster, which allows you to do imaging at 0.5 million frames per second, which can be useful in some of the<br>DoD applications. So we have been funded by the Defense Department to develop this large area of plates, which are then used to assemble digital<br>imaging detectors, and we have set up a pilot line to manufacture these screens, the RMD using screen printing technology. A whole bunch of<br>screens are delivered to the Arnold Air Force Base during last year. And we're also using the same technology to develop the Backscatter imaging<br>system with the SME.<br>
Next slide please. The ongoing activity, we have reported on this in previous years also, but one of the interesting ongoing activities we have is in<br>non-strip (inaudible) evaluation, and we use our proprietary magnetic sensors Eddy Current technology to look at some of the imperfections and<br>cracks and such in various components in the engines of aircraft and such. So we have essentially this particular item that I'm describing here is<br>for a Pratt &amp; Whitney rotor blade engine. And because these flexible Eddy Current sensors developing can be multi-sensors platform, the screening,<br>the scanning time is reduced by almost a factor of 4 compared to the conventional technologies. So we have been supplying these sensors to<br>some of the commercial as well as defense customers for screening.<br>
And then another exciting early stage research area that we have going on at RMD is in the so-called thallium bromide detectors. Thallium bromide<br>is a new semiconductor gamma ray technology, and essentially works by detection of charges. So when gamma ray comes into thallium bromide,<br>they produce electron whole pairs, and that provides detection of energy, as well as the spatial information of the event, and it can help in implications<br>in medical imaging, particularly positron emission tomography, which is a big platform in medical imaging. The challenge for using thallium<br>bromide in that modality is that the thallium signature of thallium bromide is slow. Usually, unique sub nanosecond timing is (inaudible) to get<br>that going, and thallium bromide thallium solution can be fairly full in 20 nanoseconds or worse. So one of the interesting ideas that we developed<br>last year was to look at the (inaudible) light emitted by thallium bromide, and use that as the platform to look at the timing information, and then<br>use the chart for energy and special information, and that worked out beautifully. We were able to get sub nanosecond timing solution using the<br>(inaudible) signals from thallium bromide for timing, and we still continue to use chart signals for energy and spatial information. So that can be<br>really a game-changing platform in coming years in potentially medical imaging areas. So we are excited on where that is going.<br>
And just a quick update on, again, I reported on this in previous years. (inaudible) is platform we are developing with Spectrum Labs in California.<br>We are the prime vendor on this, and this platform is to look for the -- is essentially to screen the cargo and containers and such, and it essentially<br>lies on a Cobalt-60 source, and an array of detectors on the other side of the cargo to take a radiographic image. The detectors we have developed<br>

together with Spectrum Labs use Caesium iodide crystals, coupled with silicon for the multiplier, and we have developed a robust technology,<br>which can operate in pretty high temperatures. And last year, we've supplied a group of Taiwanese detectors to Spectrum Labs, and they were<br>evading to the(inaudible) platform to really have the imaging system and the early results look very promising. We anticipate this being an activity<br>in coming years for RMD.<br>
So again, thank you for your time, and I look forward to talking to you next year again. And I like to introduce Dr. Gary Bishop from our photonics<br>division to give the next presentation.<br>
<b>Gary J. Bishop</b> - Dynasil Corporation of America - EVP of Photonics<br>
Good morning, everybody. My responsibility is for the Dynasil commercial optics businesses. And specifically, I'm responsible for the performance<br>of 3 of Dynasil's operating companies. Dynasil Fused Silica produces fused silica blanks, the fundamental building blocks for polished optics and<br>lenses and windows for the optical component industry.<br>
EMF, the oldest coating company in the United States coats a broad range of glasses, metals and plastics. For example, specialized mirrors in the<br>dental industry and cold mirrors for automotive head up displays. Finally, Optometrics specializes in the production of wavelength selective<br>components. For example, very high volume optical diffraction gratings and narrow and broadband optical filters.<br>
I'm now very excited to tell you a little bit about the new significant thrust at Dynasil into the infrared optical coating, optical component and<br>optical assembly market. In late 2016, Dynasil hired a new business development person, who brought more than a decade in technical expertise<br>in infrared coatings to Dynasil. While Dynasil was developing its initial infrared coating capability, acquisitions and consolidations in the photonics<br>industry led to an immediate infrared optical supply opportunity to those who are able to react. Dynasil put a strategic plan in place to accelerate<br>this move into the infrared optics market with investments in equipment, infrastructure and people, approved by Dynasil's Board of Directors last<br>summer. Dynasil launched its foray into the optics and infrared optics market at photonics last month, which is Dynasil's largest trade show of the<br>year.<br>
Infrared optics are critical to thermal imaging used by security services and in autonomous driving to enhance night vision. In 2017, Dynasil hired<br>a senior optical coating engineer who brings extensive experience in the design of these infrared coatings and coating technologies in the production<br>of the coated optics. Dynasil's initial product offerings consist of high-efficiency anti-reflection coatings to maximize the transmission of this infrared<br>light through the lens system to the camera.<br>
Early next quarter, Dynasil will have a Dynasil-optimized fourth-generation diamond-like coating chamber, operational, and will be able to coat<br>the surfaces of the windows or lenses that are subject to the exterior elements of the weather that most of these lenses see. The addition of the<br>diamond-like coating will provide the one-stop shop solution mentioned on the previous slide and demanded by our customers.<br>
The next logical extension to the one-stop shop solution is to produce complete optical subassemblies to our customers' end products. For this,<br>Dynasil needs to have a clean space capability, which is currently under development, as well as the expertise to run such a facility. Dynasil is very<br>pleased to announce that its new manager of operations in Littleton in the area of Massachusetts brings high volume optical assembly expertise<br>to the company. Dynasil has also secured the services of an optical industry veteran in the quality assurance management side of the business to<br>further enhance our capabilities for our upstate New York coating facilities in Ithaca and Rochester.<br>
The next slide provides an exploded view of what a typical optical assembly might look like. Other ongoing initiatives inside Dynasil, one of the<br>major ones has been -- this new incompletion has been the upgrade of our web presence from both a subsidiary perspective, as well as the corporate<br>needs. With the Dynasil subsidiaries being folded under the Dynasil banner, we are now providing 1 phase to the customer. The advantage that<br>this brings to the customer can now grasp the extensive technological and manufacturing capability that Dynasil can bring to bear in support of<br>our customers' needs. Dynasil also launched its commerce capability that provides our customers with the access -- direct access to broad product<br>offerings in Dynasil's portfolio.<br>

<A name=49></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:00PM, DYSL - Dynasil Corporation of America Annual Shareholders Meeting<br>
We've seen strong demand for our precision blank fabrication. With the ever-increasing demand for thinner, lighter, more compact, mobile phones,<br>computer-related technologies, this has accelerated the use of next-generation production technologies. Extreme ultraviolet imaging technologies<br>are now being used to further reduce the feature size in the next-generation microprocessors to either make these devices smaller or packing more<br>computing power.<br>
This has led, in part, to increased demand for Fused Silica used in the optics that provide the parts of the imaging system and these next-generation<br>products and technologies. Dynasil's extensive knowledge and technical expertise in Fused Silica blank production is supporting the ramp of these<br>leading edge production capabilities.<br>
While Dynasil is very good at high volume optical coating and optical component production, it also has extensive experience in coating very large,<br>very heavy optical components. Recently, Dynasil's Ithaca facility assisted the world-renowned Palomar Observatory in San Diego in the design<br>and coating of a 50-inch 1.3-meter diameter, 1/2 inch thick lens that had to be produced in a short timeframe. In the same vein, last year, Dynasil's<br>Ithaca facility coated a reflective surface of a 40-inch 1-meter diameter mirror for an observatory in New South Wales. This was achieved -- sorry,<br>this mirror was turned around in 4 days from the time the mirror arrived at Ithaca's facility, saving the end-user a lot of time and money in that<br>process. Dynasil also coats very large mirrors for flight simulators. Thank you very much indeed for your time.<br>
<b>Peter Sulick</b> - Dynasil Corporation of America - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
Okay. So as you can tell, I think they were working on a number of really interesting things, and sometimes, I occasionally feel more like a provost<br>than the president. But with that, I think we will open things up for questions. (Operator Instructions) And we'll move into the question and answer<br>period. So everyone that presented, if you can sit at this table, you'll be closer to the microphone in case there's a question for you.<br>
And for everyone in the room, the questions will be live over the phone, so we will all hear them.<br>

Well, I guess we've just blown everybody away. Well, then I guess we'll conclude the meeting.<br>
Thank you all for coming. Those of you that are on the phone, that were on the website or otherwise dialed into the webcast, very much appreciate<br>it. If you don't mind, maybe send us a little bit of feedback through Patty and through our investor website to let us know how it went. It's the first<br>time we've tried this so we're hopeful it went well. Thank you, all, and I will be talking to you shortly via the 8-K on the results of the elections. Good<br>afternoon.<br>

I would now like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Gary Wojtaszek.<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thanks, Schafer. Howdy all, and welcome to CyrusOne's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call.<br>
We had a really good quarter and another outstanding year, putting up very strong results and continuing to grow our U.S. business organically<br>while strategically positioning the company to grow internationally. Since we just celebrated our fifth anniversary as a public company, I wanted<br>to begin with a brief recap of our accomplishments over that period.<br>
As Slide 4 shows, we have been consistently executing the same methodical strategy for the past 5 years, which is no different than what we had<br>been doing for the prior 10 years when we were private. Our strategy is simple. First, we have been and will continue to be maniacally focused on<br>being the low-cost leader in the industry, being able to bring on megawatts of capacity at the lowest cost and fastest time to market, which has<br>enabled us to generate mid-teens returns and reduce our capital at risk. While a few have doubted our capabilities in this area, and despite our<br>willingness to explain investors how we do it, I would just point out that many companies in our industry seem to now be constantly talking about<br>cost savings, supply chain efficiency, modular building techniques and speed to market, which are all things we were innovating on for many years.<br>So if imitation is a form of flattery, we are doing pretty well. Having said that, we believe there remains significant demand for quality data center<br>space for years to come, and there is plenty of room for successful growth across our industry and our peer group.<br>
The second thing that we do, which is arguably our greatest strength, is sell. We identified and targeted selling to enterprise customers many years<br>ago and have been incredibly successful targeting this segment. Three years ago, we believe that the cloud companies were going to change the<br>data center landscape, and we started focusing on those customers, 3 years later, we count practically every single cloud company as a customer,<br>all of which are asking us to expand internationally with them.<br>
Over the 5-year period since our IPO, we have stuck to these 2 strategies and have methodically grown and significantly diversified the business,<br>expanding our portfolio across the entire United States. Over this period, we have more than tripled our revenue and adjusted EBITDA, increased<br>the size of our real estate portfolio by 4 million square feet to a total of nearly 6 million and quintupled the value of the company. In short, through<br>the tremendous effort of an incredible team and never veering from our course, we have basically exceeded every goal we had set out to achieve<br>for ourselves 5 years ago and have been the fastest-growing company in our industry during this period.<br>
Moving to Slide 5. Revenue of $180.5 million was up 31% over the fourth quarter of 2016, and adjusted EBITDA of $104.2 million was up 43%, which<br>was one of the highest growth rates since our IPO. Normalized FFO of $0.84 per share was up 24% compared to last year. In the quarter, we leased<br>9 megawatts of power and 86,000 colocation square feet, and our bookings totaled $18 million in annualized GAAP revenue, 10% below our<br>bookings goal of $20 million as a result of some deal delays for some very large cloud customers that pushed to Q1.<br>
For the year, we signed 58 megawatts and more than 520,000 square feet totaling $105 million in revenue, an average of more than $26 million<br>per quarter, which is over 30% above our targeted quarterly close rate and well above our respective market share as measured by revenue.<br>
As Slide 6 shows, we signed 20 new customers this quarter with the highest total in the past 2.5 years. Roughly 60% of our deals this quarter were<br>for smaller deployments, highlighting our enterprise sales focus, which resulted in an average price of $170 per kilowatt, which is 12% higher than<br>our trailing 4-quarter average and 25% greater than our trailing 8-quarter average when we had some very large hyperscale deals. We continue<br>to sell well above our respective market share, and bookings for the year were equivalent to 18% of our base revenue, which will continue to propel<br>our growth into 2018 and beyond.<br>
As shown on Slide 7, we are continuing to see strong performance in our interconnection business, which generated $9.2 million of revenue in the<br>quarter. This is up 20% year-over-year, which is one of the highest growth rates in the industry and reflects the changing network topology, driven<br>by hyperscale cloud deployments in our facilities, combined with the hybrid cloud deployments of our enterprise customers. As an aside, adding<br>IX to our product portfolio has been the only meaningful change we have made to our product offering in the last 10 years and has been very<br>successful as measured by its growth rate.<br>

<A name=54></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, CONE - Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call<br>
Moving to Slide 8. Our sales funnel is the largest it's been in our history, up 9% sequentially and nearly 40% from a year ago, with 60% to 70% of it<br>coming from cloud companies, which are increasingly willing to outsource more of their primary data center needs to us, and we expect them to<br>continue that trend as we expand internationally. Given the strength of our sales funnel over time, we decided to make substantial investments<br>in our U.S. platform, providing us with additional capacity to grow. As of year-end, we had over 250,000 more white floor space available to sell<br>than we did last year across our key markets, which you may recall is when we were essentially sold out. Upon full lease-up of this built out white<br>floor space, we expect to generate $100 million to $140 million in additional revenue, equivalent to approximately 20% of our 2017 base revenues.<br>We also have another 1.5 million of built out shell capacity plus more capacity under development. Additionally, we purchased 44 acres of land in<br>Atlanta in the quarter, which gives us a stronger presence in the Southeast and increases our total land bank to more than 340 acres, which should<br>provide us with adequate inventory to grow over the next few years.<br>
In short, I believe our U.S. operations are performing at a very high level with strong demand coming across from both enterprise and cloud<br>customers. We also have plenty of immediate inventory available and future capacity that we can build out, which enable us to grow in the U.S.<br>market for the next several years.<br>
Given our already strong position in the market, we will deemphasize investing more capital in the United States and redirect some of our capital<br>spend towards international expansion where we believe we have a better strategic opportunity to win more market share and, as we have proven<br>in the U.S. market, achieve very attractive profitable growth.<br>
Moving to slides 9 through 11. I wanted to recap our thinking on international expansion. Last year, I mentioned that by the second quarter of<br>2018, we will have a sizable presence outside of the U.S., and in the fourth quarter, we positioned ourselves to do just that. Our focus on growing<br>internationally is grounded in the belief that in order to best serve our customers, we need to have a broader product portfolio. What we are<br>witnessing is that the biggest customers are buying globally, and a large part, these are the hyperscale cloud providers followed by enterprise<br>companies. The demand is concentrated in the major global markets, and our 2 other U.S.-based global data center competitors are generating<br>significant demand in overseas markets from their existing U.S.-based customers, which we are effectively shut off from at this point because we<br>do not have an international presence.<br>
Our approach to international expansion is to leverage our core competencies, including our expertise in design and construction, our best-in-class<br>sales organization and our emphasis on providing unparalleled customer service. We will focus on the markets where demand is aggregating and<br>pursue a dual-track approach to establishing a presence in those markets, including organic expansion opportunities as well as M&amp;A.<br>
In October, we announced $100 million investment in GDS, which is one of the most successful data center companies operating in China today.<br>China is one of the fastest-growing data center markets in the world with the largest number of cloud companies outside of the U.S. It's also one<br>of the more challenging markets to do business in. GDS is a phenomenal company led by a great team that is culturally very aligned with the way<br>CyrusOne sees the world and works with customers. As of yesterday, our investment in GDS was worth more than $220 million, increasing over<br>120% in value in just a few months. However, the primary reason we entered into this arrangement with GDS is because of the partnership we are<br>working on together, which will help our companies grow faster in Asia and the U.S. This partnership is working very well, and in a short amount<br>of time, we have generated significant deal funnel that will allow our respective customers to grow in each other's markets, benefiting both our<br>companies and the customers that we serve. We expect to close our first deal with the Chinese cloud company this quarter.<br>
We followed up the GDS transaction with the year-end announcement of the agreement to acquire Zenium, which we are very excited about.<br>Franek and his team are experienced operators, and they have done a remarkable job building and growing that business. Similar to us, they have<br>a particular emphasis on hyperscale cloud companies, which represent more than 75% of their portfolio and many of the same customers who are<br>excited about the opportunity to work with CyrusOne at scale in Europe. They have a total of 4 data centers in London and Frankfurt and very well<br>positioned to capitalize on the demand I was just referring to with 22 megawatts of capacity available for immediate development and lease-up.<br>
Europe has historically been an interconnection-driven market, but in the last couple of years, demand has accelerated and the size of the deals<br>has increased, in large part driven by the hyperscale cloud companies. This demand is concentrated in a few major markets, and due to the lack of<br>larger-format data center providers in those markets, it is being captured by secondary providers or interconnection-focused competitors. As we<br>expand organically, we will be able to leverage the management team. There is another site in Frankfurt under contract, and there are other organic<br>

development opportunities in the late stages of negotiation in London, Frankfurt and Dublin. Additionally, we anticipate achieving future cost<br>synergies through the benefits of scale such as improved purchase economics and potentially through acquisitions as we expand into additional<br>markets.<br>
Given the maturation of the European data center market, significant demand growth, particularly for larger deals and the positioning of Zenium,<br>we believe there's a tremendous opportunity over the coming years. We hope to close on the transaction at the beginning of the second quarter,<br>and would expect to have closed a number of additional deals by then as well. We estimate that Zenium's adjusted EBITDA will grow by over 80%<br>next year. However, the bigger opportunity that we will acquire with Zenium is a platform that will enable us to acquire many other assets in Europe,<br>which will be substantially more accretive as we will have an efficient platform to acquire them with.<br>
In closing, we ended 2017 in a very strong position. We generated fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 31% and 43%, respectively,<br>which are some of our fastest growth rates over the past 5 years. We increased our dividend an additional 10% and have almost tripled it over the<br>past 5 years. We also raised $700 million of capital in the quarter with leverage of 4.7 and ended the year with over $1.2 billion of liquidity, which<br>will enable us to continue to fund our growth throughout 2018.<br>
Given our strong fundamental performance this quarter as well as our peers, it's pretty astonishing that the REITs have fallen by 11% since the<br>beginning of the year and the data centers by an even greater amount, which are down by about 16% since January 1. While it'll be easy to conclude<br>that the recent stock price performance -- that there are some bigger issues facing our industry, I think this is shortsighted. Our business is<br>fundamentally just as strong today as it was 2 months ago. The growth in our business is driven by an outsourcing trend in cloud and enterprise<br>companies, and as you saw from the recent record results posted by Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce, which grew between 40% to 60%<br>year-over-year, this trend is not slowing down anytime soon and will continue to propel our business for the next several years.<br>
While rising interest rates are not helpful for REITs in general, I would point out that the data centers are growing at considerably faster rates than<br>the average REIT, in our case, almost 500% faster, and the best way to combat rising interest rates is through growth. Given where our stock price<br>is currently trading, we are offering a 4% dividend yield and just provided 2018 EBITDA guidance of 25% growth this year as well. There are not<br>many investment opportunities in the industry that carry this type of current cash yield with a very strong secular growth story attached to it, which<br>is why I believe that the longer term our share price and my peers will continue to do very well.<br>
I will now turn the call over to Diane who'll provide more color on our financial performance for the quarter and our guidance for '18. Thanks a lot.<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. As Gary mentioned, we were very busy in 2017 and had another great year.<br>
As Slide 13 shows, our growth in the fourth quarter was particularly strong. Adjusted EBITDA grew 43% compared to the prior year, and that was<br>the second-highest quarterly growth rate since our IPO, while revenue and normalized FFO grew 31% and 39%, respectively.<br>
The company's growth continues to be driven primarily by strong leasing execution in both the cloud and enterprise company industries and the<br>growth of the interconnection business. In addition, our 2017 results included 10 months of operations from our Sentinel acquisition. Full year<br>churn was 3.9%, below the lower end of our full year guidance range of 6% to 8% and the lowest annual churn rate since 2013. We anticipate that<br>our full year 2018 churn will be in the 6% to 8% range, consistent with our annual forecast for the past several years.<br>
The weighted average remaining lease term of our portfolio is currently at almost 4.5 years, which has nearly doubled over the last 5 years. Over<br>the same period, the percentage of month-to-month contracts and up for renewal in the next 12 months has steadily decreased. We expect that<br>over time, this percentage will continue to decrease as our average new lease terms are longer than the remaining duration of our existing portfolio.<br>
Turning to Slide 14. NOI grew 34% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by the increase in revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin was up 4.6<br>percentage points and at nearly 58%, which was our highest quarterly margin as a public company. As we've discussed in past quarters, this<br>

<A name=56></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, CONE - Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call<br>
improvement is largely being driven by revenue growth without a commensurate growth in overhead. Normalized FFO increased 39%, while<br>normalized FFO per share grew 24%.<br>
As the chart at the bottom of the slide shows, the net impact of the adjustments to normalized FFO to arrive at AFFO was slightly negative in the<br>fourth quarter and more in line with what we would anticipate without an elevated level of customer installations that impacted the third quarter<br>adjustment.<br>
Slide 15 provides an overview of the portfolio by market. As you can see, we have significantly grown our footprint over the last 12 months to<br>accommodate the demand we are seeing across our market. Our portfolio is very well balanced geographically and with our international expansion<br>will be further diversified. The table on the right shows that utilization for stabilized properties as of the end of the fourth quarter was 93%, 1<br>percentage point higher than the prior year period. While total utilization declined 2 percentage points year-over-year, that still reflects strong<br>underlying demand, considering our colocation square feet footprint increased by 57% over that same 12-month period.<br>
Slide 16 summarizes our development pipeline as of the end of the quarter, which includes projects in Dallas, Northern Virginia, Phoenix and Austin<br>that will deliver 163,000 colocation square feet and 39 megawatts of power capacity. Approximately 27% of the pipeline is preleased, and we<br>expect meaningful additional leasing to occur by this time this capacity comes online, given the strength of our late-stage sales funnel across these<br>markets.<br>
In Dallas, we're building the seventh and final data hall at our Carrollton location and the first data hall at our new Allen location. In Northern<br>Virginia, we brought the third data hall online in our Sterling V facility, adding 81,000 square feet. And the fourth data hall, which is fully preleased,<br>is currently under construction. Finally in Phoenix, we brought the first data hall at our Chandler V facility online, adding 72,000 square feet and it<br>is currently 50% utilized. Upon completion of the project in our development pipeline, our portfolio will have increased 65% to nearly 3.5 million<br>square feet of raised floor from just over 2 million square feet at the end of 2016. In addition, the Zenium transaction will provide further upside,<br>given the development capacity in their portfolio.<br>
Moving to Slide 17. We ended the year with a conservative capital structure and really strong balance sheet with leverage of 4.7x. No debt maturities<br>until 2021, a fully unencumbered asset base with a gross book value of over $5 billion and available liquidity, as Gary pointed out, of over $1.2<br>billion.<br>
During the fourth quarter, we raised nearly $300 million in our market equity program, and on a market cap basis, shareholders' equity represents<br>more than 70% of our total underpriced value. Our fixed floating interest rate mix is currently now more weighted to fixed rate debt at roughly<br>60-40 fixed-to-floating debt at year-end.<br>
Turning to Slide 18. As you know, we closed $400 million senior notes offering in nearly November, adding to the notes issued early in the year. It<br>was a very successful offering, raising $200 million in both the 7- and 10-year tranches, yielding a blended coupon of approximately 4.3%, which<br>was very attractive pricing. Combined with the March offering, we smoothed our debt maturity schedule and again achieved a better mix of fixed<br>to floating rate. Our weighted average debt term now is approximately 6 years, up from a little over 5 years at the end of 2016.<br>
Given our consistent execution, the scale and diversification of the business, the durability of our cash flows and our strong balance sheet, we are<br>hopeful that we will achieve an investment-grade rating in the near term, consistent with many other REITs that have similar profiles to ours.<br>
Turning to Slide 19. As Gary mentioned, we are increasing the dividend in the first quarter of 2018 to $0.46 a share per quarter, which is a 9.5%<br>increase over the quarterly dividend rate of $0.42 a share in 2017. This represents over 4% yield based on our current stock price. The current<br>dividend is nearly triple of what it was in 2013, and note that 100% of our 2017 payout was return of capital, enhancing the after-tax yield for<br>investors with taxable income.<br>
When considering how to maximize value for our shareholders, we try to be very thoughtful in determining the optimal allocation between retaining<br>a reasonable level of cash for our capital requirements, which drives our continued growth and paying an attractive cash dividend to our investors.<br>

Turning to Slide 20. Our revenue backlog as of the end of the quarter was $20 million. As shown on the bottom chart, we expect nearly 2/3 to<br>commence by the end of the first quarter and the remainder to commence in the following 2 quarters.<br>
Slide 21 shows our guidance for 2018. We've assumed that Zenium transaction closes on April 30, and this timing is reflected in our outlook. The<br>guidance midpoint for total revenue reflects a 22% year-over-year increase, and excluding the contribution from the Zenium asset, revenue growth<br>is anticipated to be in the 17% to 19% range.<br>
While many stocks in the REIT industry have pulled back since the beginning of 2018 on the back of rising rates, growth, as Gary mentioned, is the<br>best way to combat these rate increases. And given our fourth quarter '17 performance as well as our 2018 guidance, you can see that our businesses<br>should continue to outgrow the impact of any future rate increases. In addition, if we achieve investment-grade, we will have a lower cost of capital,<br>which will also combat increasing interest rate.<br>
As I mentioned earlier, we expect revenue churn for the year to be in the 6% to 8% range, which is what we have historically forecasted. The adjusted<br>EBITDA guidance midpoint reflects the 25% year-over-year increase. The implied margin, assuming the midpoints of the revenue and EBITDA<br>guidance, is 56.9%, a 1.6 percentage point increase over the 2017 margin. The expected margin expansion is driven by increased scale, offset<br>partially by additional SG&amp;A expense we expect to incur for our European expansion as we build out the international platform. We anticipate<br>normalized FFO per share of $3.23 at the midpoint of our range, and I'll provide more color on this on the next slide. We expect capital expenditures<br>to be in the similar range to last year at $850 million to $900 million. However, the mix will shift, as we show at the bottom of the slide. Specifically,<br>we plan to spend approximately $300 million less building out facilities in the U.S. as a result of the inventory we brought online in 2017, and we<br>plan to spend more on land in international markets versus domestic. It's important to note that only $20 million of our capital spend in 2017 was<br>for land acquisitions.<br>
Consistent with our stated expansion plan, we expect to spend approximately $300 million acquiring land and building additional data center<br>capacity in Europe as we scale that operation.<br>
Slide 22 shows the expected impact of various investments to normalized FFO per share in 2018, assuming the mix of debt and equity consistent<br>with our stated financial objectives. As mentioned in the Zenium announcement material in December, we expect this transaction to be initially<br>dilutive, having a $0.13 to $0.17 range impact in 2018. However, the business for Zenium is growing rapidly, and in 2019, we expect adjusted EBITDA<br>from this acquisition to increase over 80% compared to 2018. In addition, acquiring this platform with an existing experienced team positions us<br>to acquire accretive transactions in Europe going forward.<br>
As noted on the previous slide, we anticipate making a significant investment in land, positioning us for continued growth in 2019 and beyond,<br>with these land investments having a $0.07 to $0.09 dilutive impact this year in 2018. Additionally, as Gary noted, we're in discussion with GDS<br>customers, but given the time it takes to sign and commence these large leases, at this point, we do not expect a significant contribution to<br>normalized FFO per share in 2018.<br>
And finally, keeping in mind that we made a significant investment to bring inventory online in the latter part of 2017 across our key markets in<br>the portfolio where we're essentially out of capacity, the result of this year, the timing impacts associated with this inventory investment during<br>the lease-up period across these markets is somewhat dilutive.<br>
Excluding the impact of these investments, which position us very well for 2019 and beyond, we would have expected 2018 normalized FFO per<br>share on a pro forma basis to be in the low teens range from a domestic-based organic growth model. We are willing to take the near-term per-share<br>dilution to position CyrusOne for the next 5 years of growth, particularly in creating an international platform to meet the demand in those markets<br>from our existing customers, as Gary mentioned in his remarks.<br>
In closing, we are really pleased with the performance across all areas of our business in 2017, and we are excited for 2018 as we continue to grow<br>the company and position ourselves for our international expansion.<br>
Thank you for calling in, and we are now happy to take any questions. Anita, if you could please open the line for questions.<br>

<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions)<br>
Our first question today comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.<br>
<b>Frank Garrett Louthan</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Can you talk to us a little bit about the preleasing trends, specifically on the CapEx number that you have and the likelihood of spending all of that<br>capital? And then can you give us an update on the Atlanta property and remind us how much of that has been preleased and when we could<br>expect to see some operations there?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Sure. Frank, Gary. So the way we think about it is as we are coming out of '17, we were trying to bring on additional inventory capacity available in<br>all the key markets, which we were sold out last year. In my prepared remarks, I talked about roughly 250,000 square feet of space available built<br>out now that we can sell into. If we were to sell out all of that and just deliver that capacity perfectly as customers would take it, we'd generate<br>anywhere between $120 million, $140 million of additional revenue. Clearly, customers don't take the capacity in exactly as we build it out, so we're<br>going to bring on some additional capacity towards the end of the year, depending on how customer demand warrants. So when you think about<br>how much capital that we're going to be spending domestically, a lot of that is going to be conditioned upon sales that we expect to occur over<br>the beginning of the year. When Diane spoke, she talked about the different amounts of capital projects that we're bringing online and shared<br>insight in terms of how much of those things are presold that we're building towards demand, and she also, in our prepared remarks, provided<br>some overview of when our revenue expects to come online. But when you look at, at a high level, we're going to spending about $300 million<br>less in capital this year. Just off the bat, that's going to be directed to Europe. And the remaining amount of that $500 million is going to be basically<br>success-based as customer demand warrants over the year. With regard to Atlanta, and for that matter, the Quincy property is the same, that we<br>bought those to basically position those properties that we could be responsive to customer needs, that we could build quickly. So our focus is to<br>get those permitted, ready to go and on the shelf when we have a customer in tow so that we could deliver that capacity for customers as demand<br>warrants. Those are going to be basically triggered by build-to-suit type deals where we're going to need about a 4- or 5-megawatt type build<br>before we kind of commit to putting something there. We've worked out our supply chain such that we can deliver that capacity in 6 months,<br>which is well within the time frame most customers need. So if you see us building anything in Atlanta, you should assume that we have a customer<br>contract in hand before we do that.<br>
<b>Frank Garrett Louthan</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Great. And just a follow-up. You said you signed your first Chinese cloud deal. Where will that be located? And is that a deal you'll have directly<br>with CyrusOne to the customer? Or is the GDS deal sort of through you? How should we think about that?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, it's a deal that we will have directly with that customer. It'll be here. We're also talking to them about potentially Europe as well. And that's<br>going to be done directly with us. We've got probably about a dozen deals right now in the funnel between customers that we're talking to that<br>want to take space in GDS facilities in China and their customers that want to take space in our facilities in the U.S. So that relationship is going<br>really well.<br>

The next question comes from Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities.<br>
<b>Robert Ari Gutman</b> - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst<br>
Two questions. At Chandler VI, I noticed a little bit of rearrangement of the -- from the prestabilized property, some with 12 megawatts was launched.<br>6 megawatts went back into development. I was wondering if that's potentially related to the pushed-out deal or what you're seeing relate to that<br>facility or more broadly, the Phoenix market. And secondly, I just wanted to ask, with the fixed to floating ratio at 60-40, how do you feel about that<br>looking forward against the macroeconomic environment?<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Well, let me address the interest rate first. I mean, we have stated generally, we're comfortable in the 50-50 range. With rising rates, we do -- we<br>are more conscious of going to a more fixed rate. We can certainly do that synthetically through swaps. But the reality is floating rates, even with<br>outlook for increases in LIBOR this year, is still at a very low rate. The other thing is we're balancing that if we get to investment-grade, that is when<br>we would want to fix more of our debt because there's at least a 100 basis point advantage for fixed rates when you're investment-grade. So we<br>do want to keep a reasonable amount of floating rate debt to be able to fix it when we achieve investment-grade.<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. With regard to our markets, I mean, this quarter, Rob, we -- Phoenix was actually our strongest markets. We sold the most of our capacity in<br>Phoenix followed by Dallas, Austin -- Dallas and Northern Virginia. I'm not sure specifically what you're talking about with stabilized or not, but our<br>funnel is -- as I mentioned in my comments, is up 9% sequentially and 40% year-over-year. So we're sitting in a really strong position. The majority<br>of that funnel is for capacity in Phoenix, Virginia and Texas. But we can [Schafer] get back to you on what you're specifically you're referring to.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
The next question comes from Richard Choe with JPMorgan.<br>
<b>Yong Choe</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - VP in Equity Research<br>
I wanted to follow up. I know you mentioned it in your prepared comments, but wanted to get a little bit more color. Given how much the stock<br>has sold off and how a lot of the reports have, I think, in a lot investors' minds been a little soft and guidance not as strong, are you seeing anything<br>different out there? Do you see demand still being strong? And then to be a little bit cynical on it is that you're dropping your domestic CapEx from,<br>call it, 800 to 500. Is that a sign? Or is just the shifting of opportunity into Europe?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, yes, Rich. Look, I mean, you have to think about our industry in the context of what's going on more broadly in the IT landscape and, in particular,<br>cloud, right. So you're coming off record sales for Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce. All of these companies came off fantastic quarters for e-commerce,<br>for cloud businesses overall. And their growth is pretty tremendous, I mean, between 40% to 60% type growth rates on companies that are tenfold<br>billions of dollar type top line companies. So these are really large companies growing at tremendous growth rates. And you see that they're not<br>slowing down. Our business, by definition, will not slow down because all of that growth that you're seeing in the cloud all resides in the data<br>center, and we are just providing the infrastructure that continues to support that growth. I think if there's anything that people should read in<br>from a quarter-to-quarter sales is just the lumpiness of how the industry works, right? I mean, these are really large transactions. When we're doing<br>

these big cloud deals, these are $400 million or $500 million purchase commitments by these customers, right? So these aren't like really short<br>sales cycles. These are long sales cycles, and they take a really long time. And while we feel that the quarterly result is little below our $20 million<br>estimate, we feel good when you look at this on the context of what we've been able to do over the last year. And over the year, we put up results<br>at about 30% greater than our expectations. When you think about our refocus in terms of CapEx, think about it in 2 ways. One is last year, we were<br>basically sold out. We were bringing on capacity all year long just to build out and meet existing customer demand that was already presold. We<br>brought on additional capacity to make sure we had inventory in those key markets because we didn't want to run out of inventory. Last year,<br>there were a couple of deals that we lost to other smaller startup players that we wouldn't have lost had we had inventory available. So we wanted<br>to be thoughtful on bringing on additional capacity, which we basically did through year-end. The result of that is that you're going to see us spend<br>significantly less capital in the U.S. because we have more inventory now that we didn't have last year. So we feel really strong from that. The other<br>thing you should think about is the way we're spending our capital is exactly in line with what we've been telling all of our partners for the last 1.5<br>years or so is that we believe, fundamentally, this is an international business that to really be effective and helpful to customers, you need to have<br>a global portfolio. And if you don't, you're in an inferior position strategically and you'll eventually be consolidated up. Our focus has always been<br>expanding internationally. When we've been talking about that in the fourth quarter, what you saw is exactly what we said we were going to do.<br>First we came out of the gate with the partnership with GDS and an investment that we made in them, which has more than doubled over the last<br>couple of months. And then we followed that up shortly with further expansion in Zenium, which we're going to basically use as our land-and-expand<br>strategy in Europe. So we acquired that entity at a pretty high multiple. It's a dilutive acquisition, but strategically, we think it's really valuable<br>because we're going to follow up with some additional capital to work there and build out a really big presence in Europe. And we expect the same<br>way methodically we've grown in U.S. over the last several years. We're going to do the same thing in Europe because we don't think that the<br>competitive landscape is nearly as vicious in Europe as it is in the U.S. And from a product perspective, no one is doing big format data centers in<br>Europe as they are doing in the U.S. We feel really confident about our ability to execute over there and export the same level of success we<br>generated in states to Europe.<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
I think, Richard, the other thing you have to think about for the domestic CapEx, we ended the year with almost $0.5 billion in CIP, and obviously,<br>that's completely a domestic pipeline. And that -- hence the additional inventory that we went into this year with. And we're still estimating another<br>$0.5 billion for domestic construction. So we're still spending about $1 billion in the U.S., but to Gary's point, the marginal capital is way more<br>weighted now towards international for the year.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
The next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.<br>
<b>Amir Rozwadowski</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst<br>
A couple of questions, if I may. Dovetailing on the prior question in terms of global demand picture right now, Gary, if we think about the opportunity<br>set in the U.S. versus Europe, clearly, as you mentioned, the incremental dollars is going to Europe at the moment in terms of spending. But do you<br>expect that shift to push or recycle back into the U.S.? Just trying to understand sort of how you think about the longer-term picture of the demand<br>dynamics here.<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
It goes back into, you have to think broadly about what's occurring in the cloud landscape, right? I mean, that industry is still in its early stages.<br>Maybe it's a $60 billion or $70 billion type of market right now out of $1 trillion annual enterprise spend. So really, really early stages. What you're<br>seeing is that the initial amount of that growth that was taking off was predominantly focused in the U.S., and that's what you saw over the last<br>couple of years. And I expect that, that's going to continue to grow really nicely in this country for many, many years. The more incremental level<br>of growth, however, in the last 4 quarters has been in Europe. As that area of the world has been developing, there's been a lot more focus by cloud<br>

companies that have been deciding to go to Europe to do things at scale. And that's -- a great example of that is Zenium, the business that we're<br>acquiring. Like Franek, a serial entrepreneur, he's created a couple of companies, and he just created this one a few years ago and what did he do<br>was he started an operation and he quickly expanded into 4 data centers in 2 of the key cities in Europe. And this is like a private operator, smaller<br>company but tremendously successful, giving you a really good insight in terms of the competitive profile there that a small private company was<br>able to be so successful. That's why we believe that when we go there, we're going to basically be able to accelerate that growth, do things at scale<br>and at a lower cost in Europe, similar to what we've been doing in the U.S. and be able to take tremendous market share, right? We've been taking<br>more market share in the U.S -- the market domestically than anyone. Even, again, this quarter, in spite of like a bookings quarter that was a little<br>below our estimates, we still took 20% market share in the U.S. and, well, actually, globally if you compare one of our competitors at international.<br>We still did really well versus a revenue share that's only about 15%. So we're punching well above our weight. We expect once we go to Europe,<br>we're going to be able to accelerate that same success over there.<br>
<b>Amir Rozwadowski</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst<br>
That's very helpful. And if I think about sort of the pieces in terms of the longer-term growth for you folks, you had mentioned with the Zenium<br>deal, 80% growth next year on an EBITDA basis and accretive on a normalized FFO basis, the potential to do additional deals in Europe, and Europe<br>in and of itself seems to be accelerating in terms of demand. Does this setup indicate -- I know it's early stage that '19 could be a better growth<br>year in terms of how you're thinking about things?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. For us, absolutely. If you think about all the things that we're just talking about on this call, right, and particularly in the bridge that Diane<br>shared in terms of the FFO bridge, like if you excluded all of these additional investments that we're doing, the GDS investments, dilution of Zenium,<br>the additional capital that we put on the ground, I mean, our FFO per share would be up 15% year-over-year. We're intentionally taking off some<br>of that to basically pay that forward in terms of setting up the company for a really nice growth rate well into '19 and beyond, because we're<br>positioning ourselves to take advantage of a competitive profile that we think we're going to be able to win in. And what that does is when we<br>made those investments in the U.S., it really frees the teams up to really focus on doing this in Europe. So now we have additional inventory. We<br>don't need the same kind of construction design teams focused on building that out, what they were doing here. We'll repurpose them to focus<br>on Europe and create the same level of success over there. So the way we run the business is all looking down the road in terms of where we're<br>going to be in 5 years' time. Like none of these are short-term, short-duration assets. We're building a business that's going to be, we believe, the<br>third global data center player in the world, and we think we're positioned well to achieve that success.<br>

The next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Jonathan Atkin</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst<br>
So I was interested in any updates on the use of potential JV partnerships as a way to finance your expansion. A couple of other -- a couple of your<br>peers recently have been talking about this possibility, and I just wondered kind of what the -- what your current view is. And then in terms of<br>competitive behavior in the U.S., if you have any sort of comments. You drew the contrast with Europe. Are you seeing it in terms of pricing? Are<br>you seeing it just in terms of just announced new supply? How is that manifesting itself?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
I'll take the competitive position. So if your comment is the domestic market, I think what you're seeing, and it's kind of related to your JV, right?<br>There's a lot of capital flowing into this business, and I think a lot of people are seeing the success that some of the publics have generated and<br>think that they're going to be able to recreate that. I think that there is an opportunity for a lot of people to do well together, but what you're seeing,<br>

from our perspective, is that we think we have adequate inventory built out now, which is why we are not looking at bringing on significantly more<br>inventory available in the U.S. And we think that the better use of our capital is really to position the company for additional growth in Europe.<br>We'll see how some of these other private companies shake out. Particularly in a rising interest rate environment, I think some of the opportunities<br>that see these people really saw originally going into it are going to be less attractive if interest rates go up another 100 points or so.<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. And on joint venture capital, we continue to have conversations. There's obviously a lot of capital that wants to get into the data center space,<br>given it's really the only real estate product type that has significant growth for years to come. But we don't have anything specific to announce<br>at this point.<br>
<b>Jonathan Atkin</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst<br>
Are you actively pursuing it? Or is it kind of on hold? How would you kind of characterize the outlook?<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
I mean, again, we have some continuing conversations. It's -- I just think those situations have a little bit longer gestation period.<br>
<b>Jonathan Atkin</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst<br>
Okay. And then just on the property level. I noticed Raleigh-Durham, it seems like the utilization grew as CSF square feet grew as well. So wondering<br>kind of what drove the activity there. It seems like it was quite strong.<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. What we talked about, I think, it was 2 quarters ago, actually, Raleigh was maybe our second or third strongest performing bookings quarter<br>that period. So you're just seeing us bring on additional capacity to meet customer demand there.<br>

<b>Simon William Flannery</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD<br>
Gary, you talked about the $20 million baseline a couple of times. Is that still a good number to use for 2018? And then on Zenium, can you just<br>talk a little bit about what your customer and potential customer commentary has been since you announced that deal? What's the reception been<br>like to them and to those assets? And let's say, you close it early in Q2 as you expect, is there much work that you need to do to prep that for bringing<br>in some of your new customers or can that start to lease up with some of your pipeline pretty quickly in mid- and later 2018?<br>

<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Sure, sure. Yes, I think the $20 million is a good bogey. And once we feel confident that the funnel is substantially higher than where it currently<br>sits now and we feel good that we can tick that up, we will, right? But we feel good about what we've been able to do this year. I mean, in aggregate,<br>we guided to $80 million of bookings for the year and we delivered $105 million of bookings throughout the year. So we're 30% over what we told<br>folks that we were going to do. We expect, as we head into '18, we're going to have quarters that we do above that, but we don't want to create<br>expectations that we're consistently going to be doing that. When I feel really good about the size of our funnel broadly, I'll definitely increase that<br>and share that with everyone. But for the time being, we're sitting in a pretty good position. I mean, our funnel is up 9% sequentially, 40% up versus<br>last year. Part of the 9% sequential increase is that some of the opportunities that we had expected to close in the first quarter pushed to the fourth.<br>So we expect that those are going to -- that we expected to close in the fourth pushed to the first. So we expect that we should do well this quarter.<br>With regard to Zenium, the response has been great. I mean, 75% of the customers that Zenium has are basically overlapping customers with us.<br>And so the opportunity to do more with those customers over there was -- is great. I mean, they're really relieved that they have a solid partner<br>now with us, a capital partner that understands their business. So we expect that we're going to be able to help Franek grow his business a lot<br>faster than they originally were able to do, and we're more willing to bring on additional capacity there to supplement the growth of what they<br>would have normally done as a private company. We're a little more willing to do capital deployments for the opportunities that we see because<br>we have a bigger sales funnel that we're tracking in the U.S., that we can bring to Europe than they probably have visibility to.<br>
<b>Simon William Flannery</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD<br>
All right. And is there any work you need to do to make that sort of ready to lease up with some of your new -- your pipeline?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, yes. We're bringing -- we're going to be bringing on additional inventory in all those, but we'll have additional capacity available there by the<br>third quarter of this year.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.<br>
<b>Vincent Chao</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - VP<br>
Just trying to pull everything together here in terms of the big opportunity you have on the investment side, particularly in Europe, either organically<br>or M&amp;A with some comments that you started with Gary about the stock prices being depressed, maybe not for the right reasons. I'm just curious,<br>how do you balance the growth plans with some of the cost of capital that's coming in a little bit? And then maybe tie that into sort of how<br>comfortable you are with taking leverage up or what you're comfortable taking leverage up to.<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. Look, I think the response in general has just been completely overblown for our -- the data centers as an asset class and us in particular, right?<br>I think if you look at the fundamental growth drivers for our business, they are just as strong now as they were 2 months ago prior to an interest<br>rate increase, which, as an aside, the 10 years only moved up 50 bps in 2 months. So it's not like a really significant move, particularly giving the<br>absolute returns that we generate in our business and the lower amount of leverage in general in the data center asset class versus the other REITs<br>broadly. So it's concerning that the equity has moved where it did, but I think for other people that are looking at it now, I think it's a pretty attractive<br>entry point. At a 4% cash yield with the growth story attached to it, it's a pretty interesting story. With regard to the way we think about the<br>opportunity and how to use additional equity for -- to fund these transactions, I think you should look for us to continue to do the same thing we<br>have methodically. I mean, as Diane mentioned, our leverage coming out of the year was 4.7, so we're at a really low levered balance sheet. We<br>

had $1.2 billion of liquidity. So we have plenty of liquidity available to fund the growth over this period, and I think, to the extent that the equity<br>levels stay at these depressed levels, we're probably going to be willing to take up the leverage a little bit more. But longer term, as we've always<br>said is that we need to stay on investment-grade glide path, and we don't want to do anything that jeopardizes our ability to do that. So you'll see<br>us as we've done over the past year, bring on additional equity when it's warranted. Over the course of '17, I think we raised about $700 million of<br>equity over the course of the year. And all the equity raises and everything else that we're planning to do are fundamentally embedded in the<br>per-share guidance number that we had shared in that. So while we've never been specific about how much equity we're going to raise in any<br>point in time, we always have also been very thoughtful, making sure that our balance sheet never gets over-levered because we want to make<br>sure that we're continuing to grow in a strong manner.<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. I mean, just to add on to Gary, the key point is, again, we were very proactive entering the year with a lot of liquidity, given we knew Jonathan<br>was looking at things that we may need to fund in the future. So we have no near-term pressure, given our leverage. The other thing is we're very<br>transparent with the rating agencies that there will be times we push leverage, particularly after funding an acquisition and then manage it over<br>time. So we don't feel any near-term pressure, and we do think what's going on in the market seem to be, as Gary said, really overdone.<br>
<b>Vincent Chao</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - VP<br>
Okay. And maybe as a follow-up question. Can you just remind us, I think, the ratings reviews are typically done mid-year. Is that right? So was that<br>sort of the first opportunity you think you could potentially get that ratings increase? And maybe just remind us what you think would be a leverage<br>level that might have an impact on a potential upgrade.<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
We don't -- obviously, we don't control the rating agencies nor when they choose to review us. So the cycle has varied, and we're closer with S&amp;P,<br>and Moody's is a little farther off. And we also keep up the dialogue with Fitch. So all we can do from our standpoint is continue to communicate<br>the story and the safety of our balance sheet. The other thing that's kind of crazy, our fixed charge coverage is over 5x. So we just communicate<br>with them and meet with them and talk to them after every quarterly call, but we don't have any visibility on what their review cycle is. The -- so<br>we can't tell you that. We just don't know it.<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. Look, Vin, I think, at the bigger picture, if you looked at us from the scale of the business and size of the business, the return on our assets, the<br>amount of leverage that we have, the fixed charge coverage ratios, like every single metric that you look at, we're in a really solid position, and we<br>comp up very favorably to many, many other real estate companies that are investment grade now. So it's unclear to us why we're not investment<br>grade now, but we don't want to do anything that jeopardizes our ability to do that. And we believe that if we continue to execute as we have over<br>the last 5 years, we're going to continue to get increases to our credit rating, which has improved every year over the last 5.<br>

<b>Jonathan Michael Petersen</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Curious about land acquisitions. I guess, first, I know you said in your prepared remarks, but can you remind us how much in the guidance is implied<br>for land acquisitions in 2018? And then just thinking kind of more broadly and longer term, when you came out of the IPO, you obviously had a<br>

decent amount of land to develop on and now you've kind of worked your way through it, you're also expanding into new markets. And I guess,<br>the question is as we model and think about your company over the next multiple years, should we be thinking about a certain run rate of land<br>acquisitions every year for you guys to further grow your business?<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Well, for this year, and in the guidance, the marginal land acquisitions are in the $150 million range. And again, to remind you, we only did $20<br>million of land acquisition in '17, which was the Atlanta parcel. So now we have plenty of land in the U.S. that are suitable for campuses, which is<br>how we like to develop. So if you look at our international guidance in the $300 million for CapEx range, roughly half is land and half is the buildout<br>of data center space, largely in the Zenium portfolio.<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. When you look at the time of our IPO, Jon, we had about $100 million of -- I mean, 100 acres of land in our inventory, and that was almost all<br>exclusively in Cincinnati. It's currently at around 340 acres. And so that delta of 140 acres is all outside of Cincinnati. And so as we sit here right now,<br>we have plenty of land available in basically every single U.S. market that we feel that we can meet plenty of existing inventory or existing customer<br>demand in all of our markets, with the exception of potentially Virginia and Phoenix, where we may need some additional capacity there in '19 or<br>so. But right now, we could basically grow really nicely in the U.S. and never have to buy any additional land. So our focus from a land acquisition<br>perspective is going to be in Europe, where we're going to be looking to acquire additional properties to augment and accelerate the growth that<br>we're picking up with Zenium and some of the other cities that we're looking at expanding to there.<br>
<b>Jonathan Michael Petersen</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Okay, that's helpful. And then, I'm curious, the bridge on the 2018 guidance, the Zenium acquisition, it looks like that's a $0.13 to $0.17 drag on<br>your estimates this year. I'm just kind of curious what the assumptions are around that. I know you raised a lot of equity in the fourth quarter. Is<br>that earmarked for the Zenium transaction as part of that dilution kind of the drag of raising capital before you actually close the deal? Or just<br>what's kind of behind that dilution in the bigger picture?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, that's calculated on just the basic 70-30 equity debt split that we're factoring in, into that. So kind of like a leverage neutral-type basis.<br>
<b>Jonathan Michael Petersen</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Okay. And should we assume -- with the equity issuance you guys did in the fourth quarter, is it safe to assume that you guys are ready to go in<br>terms of closing the Zenium transaction with the capital you have now? Or should we expect additional equity [to build up]?<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. So in fact, we're sitting on $1.2 billion of liquidity, and the Zenium acquisition price is around $440 million.<br>

<b>Colby Alexander Synesael</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
2 questions, if I may. First off, on leasing, you mentioned that some of the deals you're anticipating in the fourth quarter got pushed. Just to be<br>clear, are you expecting those to actually close in the first quarter or just more broadly, 2018? And if there's anything there to kind of explain what<br>might have happened just to get a sense if we're getting back on track as early as the first quarter. And then secondly, just I guess, a modeling<br>question. In your FFO per share guidance, can you tell us what you're assuming for shares outstanding for 2018 and also what you're assuming for<br>interest expense as it relates for 2018?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, I'll take the first part.<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
I'll take the second one.<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Okay. Go ahead.<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Shares outstanding, no. But that was another good try, Colby, because we really don't....<br>
<b>Colby Alexander Synesael</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
What seems like a pretty basic question, just to understand some of the metrics that go into what the guide is.<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, part of it, though, is timing and everything else. So -- but the interest rates -- we do have interest rates rising throughout the year similar to<br>just what the market guidance is from economists and our investment bankers. So we definitely have the interest rate going up throughout the<br>year. We do not have a specific share count.<br>
<b>Colby Alexander Synesael</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
The interest expense, is there a number that's being factored in that we could plug into our models?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
2 additional raises effectively is in there. With regard to the question on leasing, right, I mean, like $18 million of bookings in the quarter is pretty<br>strong, I mean, relatively speaking, from a market perspective, right? That's about 20% of the market in the U.S. So we punched to well above our<br>weight in that quarter. Below the $20 million that we had mentioned, but when you look at these things over the course of the year, as I mentioned<br>to Simon, we had $105 million in bookings on a guided number of $80 million. So we did well above that. We expect that, and this is the reason<br>why I've been hesitant to ever say we're going to be doing more than $20 million because we don't want people taking up their expectations and<br>factoring that in and setting expectations that we believe are unrealistic. That is exactly why I originally came out with the $20 million because<br>

coming out of '16, we were seeing quarters of $40 million and $50 million of bookings. People thought that was going to continue forever, and I<br>wanted to tamp people's expectations down, which is the reason why I came out with that $20 million 5 or 6 quarters ago. So as I mentioned to<br>Simon, once we feel good that the funnel is much bigger, we will take that up, but for the time being, people would assume that it's still $20 million<br>of bookings a quarter, and we expect that there's going to be some quarters we'll do above that. But we're not going to be guiding to that. We<br>expect that some of the deals that were supposed to happen in the fourth quarter will close in the first quarter, and we feel good about continuing<br>to be able to deliver that $20 million of bookings over the course of '18.<br>
<b>Colby Alexander Synesael</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
I think that the point, though, is that the $20 million number that you keep on referring to is fairly arbitrary. I mean, I understand that your point<br>is to reduce expectation, but when you look at the mid-teens growth, particularly now on a much bigger base, including Zenium, you're going to<br>have to do higher than $20 million on an average basis through 2018 if you want to sustain being a mid-teens growth company?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
That would be correct, and we feel confident about the $20 million. And we also feel confident about the revenue that we guided as well.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
The next question comes from Sami Badri with Cr�dit Suisse.<br>
<b>Ahmed Sami Badri</b> - Cr�dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
So regarding earlier comment you made regarding the smaller players winning deals in the market, just maybe so we can get a better sense, what<br>types of yields are these players signing leases at? And assuming the number of small players continue to spin up, could this drive Cyrus to want<br>to change pricing for some of the leasing or the deals that you guys are currently engaging in?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Look, I think, Sami, when you look at -- look, we don't like losing. It's fundamentally what the read-in should be. When you look at the amount of<br>deals that we closed this year, we closed the largest amount of deals proportionally than anyone in the industry in '17, and that was the same thing<br>that you saw in '16. Anytime we lose any deal to people, that's something that -- it just irritates us because we play to win. And when we lose, it's<br>an opportunity lost for us. So our game has not changed. Our pricing, the way we approach customers, the way we do everything has not changed<br>at all. And customers really like doing business with us, so that's why they continue to do more. The deals that I mentioned that we lost, these are<br>actually pretty sizable deals and we lost it to good competitors that closed those deals. But the reason those competitors won was because we<br>didn't have inventory available in 2 key markets, which was Virginia and Chicago at the time, and we lost those deals to 2 other competitors that<br>fortunately won. So -- but nothing's changed in the competitive landscape. I think, if anything, I think what you see by the amount of people trying<br>to put capital to work here is that they all see how well everyone is doing, and they all see the broad demand and they see how big this industry<br>is going to get to over time, which is why there's a lot of capital that's looking to come into the space either through private means or even in the<br>JV arrangements that we've been discussing with folks. I think the underlying thesis for that is that everyone feels really good about the broad<br>secular demand drivers in this industry, which is why they're willing to commit the amount and duration of the capital that they will need to tie up<br>in the space.<br>

<b>Ahmed Sami Badri</b> - Cr�dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Got it. And then just another question is, what number -- like, what's the number of leases or maybe just annualized were then signed that came<br>from the channel versus your direct sales force?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
It's less than 10%.<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes.<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
I mean, it's pretty minor. I mean, and that's one of the things. I think a lot of people -- there's not a lot of good information flow in this industry, and<br>I think everyone is always latching on different information sources to get a good beat of what's going on. The reality is that 90% to 95% of all of<br>the deals that we do, they are on a direct basis, and hardly any come through the channel. So I feel for you and all of your peers that are trying to<br>come up with estimates in terms of what the demand profile looks like, the pricing and that sort of thing because a lot of that data out there is<br>pretty suspect because the reality is not a lot of those indirect channels have access to the customers and the deal flow that we do. But in our case,<br>it's 5% of our deals in '17 came through that channel.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc.<br>
<b>Jordan Sadler</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst<br>
So I was trying to figure out the sources and uses, but I think that one has been asked enough. But I'd be curious, just on the total uses, Diane, is it<br>the $875 million of total CapEx plus $442 million for Zenium in terms of what's committed right now?<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Well, first of all, I wouldn't say the CapEx is committed, right? So the Zenium obviously, yes, the $440 million is -- we have to for sure spend. We just<br>gave you a range of capital, but it's going to depend on the sales funnel. So we -- and the timing could be later in the year, but we've always provided<br>an annual range just based on our best estimate at the beginning of the year.<br>
<b>Jordan Sadler</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. Do you have a better indication for what the full -- the all-in price on Zenium will be yet, given that we are closing in on closing with the<br>additional CapEx? Is that baked into the international CapEx guide of $285 million to $305 million?<br>
<b>Diane M. Morefield</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Right. it would fall -- anything above the $440 million would fall in that umbrella, correct.<br>

<A name=69></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, CONE - Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. I think, on the call, we're talking about including a book but not build number, on an EBITDA multiple basis, roughly 18x. I expect, given the<br>sales that we're tracking and the funnel that they are doing, that by the time this closes that, that multiple would probably be down 2 turns. And<br>that's kind of -- we're trying to provide some type of insight into that. We're talking about 80% growth rate in Zenium for '19 to give you some<br>flavor in terms of the type of growth that we're expecting out of that business. And that number is exclusive of any of the other organic things that<br>we're going to do to enhance the growth rate for that particular asset.<br>
<b>Jordan Sadler</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay, wow. So that's with additional leasing. But does that include the additional CapEx that you've guided toward, that multiple?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, so it's roughly $300 million of CapEx for Europe, and that's split -- it will be dependent upon what stuff that we're going to buy there in terms<br>of either brownfield redevelopments of existing properties or greenfield land. So that's all embedded in there. But the 80% growth number is<br>exclusive of all that additional. The additional capital that we have that we'll put the work in Zenium is included in that $300 million.<br>
<b>Jordan Sadler</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And then did you say what was causing the delay in terms of the customer signing from 4Q to 1Q? Is there anything in particular you can<br>point to?<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
We're -- as I was mentioning, I forget we mention, I mean, the deals when they sign up with us are $400 million commitments, in case $500 million<br>commitments with us. But in addition to that, the way most of these customers are doing their underwriting when they get their approvals is that<br>they have to layer in the amount of additional capital that they have to put in to basically fill up these data centers. So if you think about it, right,<br>the amount of capital that we put in is only about 1/3 of the capital that our customers would have to put in. So when they're going for approvals<br>in their organizations, their approval requests could be like $1 billion, $1.5 billion type commitment. And so those are big numbers. Even for guys<br>that have $40 billion of cash on their balance sheet, $1 billion, $1.5 billion commit is expensive. So I think what you're seeing there is just the results<br>of that. And so I would expect that timing of those bigger deals will still continue to be lumpy, but the broader trends are still really robust and<br>strong.<br>
<b>Jordan Sadler</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And then this is a little bit more of a bigger picture one. We've talked about the tenure a little bit and sort of the impact it may have had. But<br>I think the concern, the reason data centers have underperformed is maybe not a function of demand, which I think everybody believes the demand<br>story. It's as you've talked about, capital coming in and then the potential for supply. And Tom Ray's new company, Equinix is doing wholesale now<br>and so many others. And there seems to be little bit of fear for the potential for oversupply. It sounds like you're not buying that at all based on the<br>demand funnel, and I get that. But my question for you is if this narrative continues and it -- and rising rates continue to be a headwind, how do<br>you fund the business, the $1.5 billion or $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion of capital you're expecting to spend in 2018 without the equity market coming<br>back?<br>

<A name=70></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, CONE - Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Gary J. Wojtaszek</b> - CyrusOne Inc. - President , CEO &amp; Director<br>
Sure. Yes. Look, I think -- and this is something -- and the reason why we have always managed the business to focus on costs is for exactly this<br>reason, right? So when we created this company, it's important to understand, we always wanted to be the low-cost provider in this industry exactly<br>for this reason that we're talking about here today because if there's any -- look, this industry broadly is capital-intensive, high fixed cost. That type<br>of broad industry backdrop, regardless of the industry, is always susceptible to pricing. The reason why we have always maintained the low-cost<br>position in the market and a supply chain that works as efficiently as it does is because I never wanted to put myself in a precarious position from<br>a capital perspective, where I would be caught doing irrational things. We've always structured the business to make money because we can always<br>make more money than everyone else because of what we've been able to do on our supply chain and our design. So we feel that we're in a really,<br>really strong position. And as interest rates rise, some of the folks that are in inferior position on the left side of their balance sheet, meaning their<br>cost to develop a megawatt of capacity is $10 million to $12 million to $13 million, they no longer have the right side of their balance sheet to<br>compete on. And as interest rates go up, their relative advantage that they would have done when they're just underwriting these things from a<br>pure equity return performance slowly goes away. And particularly, if you're levering up a lot, it goes even further away. So as interest rates rise,<br>we believe that the low-cost provider in this industry is going to do really well, and we think that we're positioned to do really well. With regard to<br>how we think about the equity, we believe that longer term, our equity is going to continue to do well. Where it sits now, it's not really attractive<br>to us. And as Diane mentioned, I mean, we've got plenty of liquidity and availability that we can fund this additional capital growth for the Zenium<br>acquisition plus this additional stuff. She also mentioned that we'll probably take up leverage a little bit more. Unless we feel that the equity level<br>is appropriate, we are in no rush to additional or issue new amount of equity, just given where we sit now and know what our prospects are. But I<br>hope that gives you a little insight in terms of kind of -- and that's also the reason why we are very focused on becoming investment grade because<br>in a capital-intensive industry, it's really strategically important to have an investment-grade rating to make sure that you always have access to<br>the capital markets when others don't. So we think we're in a really good position as we're heading into '18 and '19 and from a cost perspective<br>and a leverage perspective, and we think we're going to continue to do well.<br>

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gary Wojtaszek for any closing remarks.<br>

<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
So we can go ahead and kick things off. My name is Kennen MacKay. I am one of the biotech analysts here at RBC. And it is my great pleasure to<br>be hosting Immunomedics in our next fireside chat here.<br>
And from Immunomedics, we have Michael Pehl, the President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as Michael Garone, the Vice President of Finance<br>and Chief Financial Officer. Thank you very much for joining us today.<br>
<b>Michael Pehl</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - President and CEO<br>
Thanks for inviting us.<br>
<b>Michael Garone</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - VP Finance and CFO<br>
Thanks for having us.<br>
<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
So maybe just before we dive into sort of a more detailed discussion of Immunomedics, maybe you can just give us a background on the Company.<br>Where Immunomedics has come from and where we are today and hopefully where we'll be a year from now -- where you will be a here from now?<br>
<b>Michael Pehl</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - President and CEO<br>
Yes. So I think many of you are aware that Immunomedics has not always been a company striving for being fully integrated. The Company was<br>set up as a research organization and worked at that for many years.<br>
That has changed with the change of the Board. And by the way, the Chairman of the Board is also sitting here, Behzad, who many of you may<br>know. But then also with the new leadership team that we brought onboard.<br>
And we think we have a great platform at hand, not just with IMMU-132 of ADC assets that are pretty unique and very differentiated. But also with<br>others that go after other targets. And not just for solid tumors, but also hematological malignancies.<br>
With that at hand and kind of with the expertise that we have inside of Immunomedics from a science perspective but also external talent that we<br>brought in, we think we are now very well positioned to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, which means manufacturing,<br>clinical, commercial, all-in.<br>

<hr>
<A name=74></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 8:05PM, IMMU - Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference<br>
So that's the change that the Company is undergoing. And of course, the big milestone for us in front of us is our first submission with our first<br>asset in metastatic triple negative breast cancer.<br>
<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
Perfect. And so speaking of that first asset, so that IMMU-132. And obviously in triple negative breast cancer, where we've seen some very impressive<br>responses as we think about sort of the treatment paradigm there.<br>
And interestingly, IMMU-132 had sort of been developed in a very different direction than ADCs I think were sort of moving at the time. This isn't<br>sort of the most toxic payload that's out there, and this isn't sort of the most payload you can conjugate to an antibody.<br>
So can you maybe just -- before we dive into some of the clinical data, give us a background on the molecule? And perhaps why that has enabled<br>it to be successful here where other ADCs or other antibodies haven't been?<br>
<b>Michael Pehl</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - President and CEO<br>
Yes, no, thanks. And it starts with the notion of it's really different. The paradigm of ADCs so far has been you have to have a very toxic warhead or<br>payload and you have to have a stable linker. And one is a little bit of a function of the other. If you have a very toxic payload in order to avoid<br>off-target side effects, you have to have this very stable linker, right?<br>
What that means is kind of the antibody needs to be internalized and then kind of the chemotherapy needs to enzymatically be cleaved off. The<br>Company Immunomedics or our Company went a different path, starting with the payload, which is the active metabolite of irinotecan. Very active<br>drug, but certainly not comparable to this super-toxic payloads that other companies have been using.<br>
And due to the fact that we have SN-38 as our warhead, we can afford to have kind of a moderately stable linker. That has a couple of advantages:<br>the drug is released at the tumor very, very quickly and it can actually be released not just in the tumor but also at the tumor when the antibody<br>is binding.<br>
So you have an effect in the cell, but you also have an effect at the tumor. And we think the efficacy and the tolerability profile of the drug, which<br>is actually very different to others, is a function of this differentiated way to look at ADCs.<br>
<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
And so maybe just getting into the clinical data. Phase 2 trial, where we've seen a pretty impressive response rate, especially considering this is,<br>again, triple negative breast cancer, a 34% response rate and PFS of 5 1/2 months. Overall survival out over a year.<br>
Can you maybe put this into context of how that compares to current standard of care? And I guess how we should be thinking about alternative<br>therapies for these agents?<br>
<b>Michael Pehl</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - President and CEO<br>
So the current therapy of this patient is really driven by clinical experience rather than by approved drugs. There is no approved drugs, unfortunately,<br>in triple negative breast cancer. That's a shame, but it is like that. That's the first thing to say.<br>
The second thing to say that the current standard of care, which is taxanes, if those patients have not been pretreated before, which is platinum<br>compounds, which is eribulin, which is vinorelbine, is insufficient. It produces a lot of toxicity but very little efficacy.<br>

<A name=75></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 8:05PM, IMMU - Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference<br>
And the efficacy goes down if you go down in the treatment lines. If you have patients with two or more prior treatments, you are talking about a<br>response rate of 10% to 15%. You are talking about the progression-free survival of one to three months. And you measure the duration of response<br>in weeks. Almost to a point where you think you are harming patients more than doing something good to them.<br>
That said, I think a drug such as sacituzumab or IMMU-132 comes up with a very different proposition. The response rate that has been essentially<br>adjudicated was 31%, but that doesn't mean that only a third of the patients is responding. We have actually round about 70% of the patients who<br>have some sort of tumor response, which is very different to what you see with chemotherapy.<br>
The duration of response is not measured in weeks, it's measured in months. So again, talking about the centrally adjudicated data here, which are<br>mostly of interest. That's round about nine months; that's very, very different. And we have been talking about the progression-free survival already.<br>
I think that offers this patient population kind of a very, very different treatment paradigm. When you are looking at the toxicity side, there's two<br>main side effects. As expected, as you have a topoisomerase-1, you have some hematological toxicity. You have neutropenia. About 40% of the<br>patients have Grade 3/4 neutropenia.<br>
What I have to say is that as part of the protocol that led to the 110 patients that we presented and is going to go into the package to FDA, there<br>was not a very consistent use of GCSF. We changed this now in our confirmatory Phase 3 study. So in the package that you saw in San Antonio and<br>that we are submitting to the regulatory authorities, we had 7% of febrile neutropenia.<br>
40% Grade 3 doesn't make an oncologist nervous. What makes the oncologist nervous is if the patient goes home and then gets fever, right? That<br>was out of 7%. We think we can bring this down substantially by GCSF use throughout. And --<br>
<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
Can you just remind us what level of GCSF use was in that trial and why that is? I would think that is part of routine treatment in breast cancer<br>especially, unless this is in a country where GCSF isn't available.<br>
<b>Michael Pehl</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - President and CEO<br>
Yes, that's right. Most of the use has been therapeutic. So patients got it when they had febrile neutropenia before and they got it like three or four<br>days. I think the way to think about here is a slightly different one.<br>
If a patient had a Grade 3/4 neutropenia in the previous cycle, you would probably like to avoid the situation in subsequent cycles. Because these<br>patients are going to have neutropenia key events again.<br>
So you try to do what I think in terms of GCSF use you would try to describe as secondary prophylaxis rather than a pure therapeutic use. That's<br>the main difference here. If you do this, I think we can bring down the febrile neutropenia rate, which is already low, very substantially.<br>
The other side effect of note is gastrointestinal, but most of it is of low grade. That is very different, for example, than when you are thinking about<br>irinotecan so -- but that's basically it. And that compares, I think, extremely favorably versus other cytostatics that is out there.<br>
<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
Yes. And then again, thinking about, I guess, a comparator here to the chemo that these patients are getting, what should we be thinking about<br>for a sort of response rate there? Like, sub sort of 20% and just maybe a month or two months of PFS? And again, that's sort of thinking about<br>frontline chemo treatment in TNBC patients and not the four-plus priors the majority of these patients have had to [retrial].<br>

<b>Michael Pehl</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - President and CEO<br>
No, I agree with you. And so if we work the way upwards for patients with more than two treatment lines, the literature shows that you can achieve<br>response rates of 10% to 15%. We are talking about three times more here and a treatment -- a duration of response of weeks. We are talking about<br>months.<br>
If you work your way upwards, so if you look at the taxanes, which are standard of care in the absence of other opportunities. And by the way, many<br>of these patients already saw taxanes as part of their adjuvant therapy. So taxanes are not even an option anymore or platinum.<br>
In a first-line triple negative metastatic setting, you see round about 30%. Now, that's something you can achieve with sacituzumab or IMMU-132<br>in a third-line-plus setting. In the data set that we had, more than 6% of the patients had more than four prior treatment lines. Every single of this<br>patient has been treated with taxanes. So that's not even representative of the numbers that I just gave to you. It's an even further down treatment<br>line.<br>
We also had about 20% of the patients who on top of the treatment with multiple lines of chemotherapy had been treated with checkpoint<br>inhibitors. Even in that population, we saw a response rate of more than 40%.<br>
So I think it's very consistent; it's much, much higher than what you currently see with the so-called standard of care. And as I was trying to say, it's<br>a very consistent throughout all the subgroups. It is independent of age; it's independent of whether you got three lines or four lines or five lines.<br>
It's independent of usage with chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor versus chemotherapy alone. You always end up with this kind of 30% to<br>40% response rate and the majority of patients having some sort of a response.<br>
The message here is the benefit of the drug is not driven by a subgroup. It is driven throughout. I think that's a very, very remarkable result when<br>you look at how heavily pretreated those patients have been.<br>
<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
And just putting the prior checkpoint treatment into context, I think that exemplifies how desperate these patients really are. Because this isn't<br>exactly an immunologically hot tumor. This is perhaps one of the colder tumor types out there where checkpoints really don't see activity.<br>
So putting this into context, what are sort of the next steps and timelines associated with the regulatory submission? What else does need to get<br>done?<br>
<b>Michael Pehl</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - President and CEO<br>
So we communicate in our earnings call that the timeline or the time point of our submission is end of May. We had previously communicated a<br>timeline that was a couple of weeks earlier, but there is some additional work ongoing in terms of assays that the FDA has been asking us to do.<br>And PK work that just needs to be finished and finalized in the right quality and that has shifted the timeline a little bit.<br>
The other work stream that is ongoing and where we have really made great progress is process validation. So doing validation runs of the antibody,<br>of the linker, of the conjugation and of the fill/finish. Most of that work is done, so the antibody work is done.<br>
The linker work is almost done and we are now doing the last work with our partner BSP in Italy, who does the conjugation fill/finish. So we are<br>really going to come in very nicely against that timeline.<br>
The third major thing for us is preparing for a preapproval inspection. That's what the FDA usually does. That's totally not unusual for our Company.<br>Every company with a biologic gets that.<br>

<A name=77></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 8:05PM, IMMU - Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference<br>
We hired someone as our head of quality who has eight years of experience as an FDA inspector. She turns basically every stone between New<br>Jersey and New York, I can tell you. And she also brought in a lot of consultants with an FDA background, so we feel that we are extremely well<br>prepared.<br>
Submission is front and center for us without any doubt. But I think we are doing extremely well against the timelines and the work that needs to<br>be done.<br>
<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
And what kind of label could we be anticipating here? I guess thinking about the patient population that was involved in that trial, what I guess<br>number of prior lines of therapy could sort of be implied by the cycle?<br>
<b>Michael Pehl</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - President and CEO<br>
I think it's going to be a reflection of what we've been having with this 110 patients. And again, the data that we showed in San Antonio is exactly<br>the data that the FDA gets from us. So it's probably fair to say or to assume that it will be patients with three or more treatment lines and patients<br>who have been pretreated with taxanes.<br>
By the way, most of these patients saw taxanes. So that's -- now, the question is what does that mean for usage, right? In terms of usage, I would<br>make an anticipation. And this is where US is very different to Europe. I come from Europe, as you can hear from my strange accent. So in the US,<br>I think, thank God, the usage is driven by medical need and the data that you have at hand.<br>
All the key opinion leaders that we talked to told us that there is no difference between the second-line situation and the third-line situation.<br>Patients are as desperate after one treatment line than they are after two treatment lines. There is just nothing available.<br>
What that means is, at least in the academic centers, everybody is going to use the drug in the second-line setting right from the get-go. In the<br>community setting, I think it's prudent and important that we are able to include data into the NCCN treatment guidelines. Generating this data<br>is an absolute priority for the Company and we are setting up the respective protocols as we speak.<br>
But we think we are going to see a lot of second-line usage right from the get-go, which we are then going to complement with more data in the<br>second-line setting. So the data is a reflection of the data but -- the label is a reflection of the data that you have. But I think the usage is going to<br>be broader right from the get-go.<br>
<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
Yes. And thinking about some of those trials -- again, not registrational trials, but smaller trials that could just help inform usage and get 132 on<br>guidelines. How are you thinking about these? Are these going to be ISTs? And if those are getting set up, why not include some frontline patients<br>there?<br>
<b>Michael Pehl</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - President and CEO<br>
Yes, so we have a couple of priorities and I'm happy to be able to talk about those. So generating second-line data is a key priority for us, and that's<br>going to be in monotherapy. We are going to not run these as an IST, but rather as a Company-sponsored study because we feel there's also from<br>a translational side there's quite a lot to learn.<br>

<A name=78></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 8:05PM, IMMU - Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference<br>
We want to much better understand as to why our patients are responding so exclusively well as compared to those who have only a minor or no<br>response. We want to understand why patients are relapsing. Is that a chemotherapy-driven event? Does that have to do with loss of antigen or<br>both?<br>
What about certain subgroups? Triple negative breast cancer is not a homogeneous treatment group. There was recent publications showing that<br>there's very different molecular subtypes and gene expression profiles. And we just want for kind of the future work that is in front of us, which is<br>frontline, which is combination, we just want to obtain as much data as we can. So that's one priority.<br>
Second priority for us -- and again, we would do this as a Company-sponsored -- is monotherapy and combination in first line. We think in order<br>to cover triple negative breast cancer completely, we need to do both. Many patients are not going to tolerate a combination therapy, although<br>it's probably a safe bet to say that a combination could be more effective.<br>
So in order to really own that, space you need to do both. From a data generation perspective, that priority for us, again, means set up a protocol,<br>have it up and running in the next 12 months. We want to generate monotherapy data because ultimately we will have to compare ourselves<br>directly head-to-head versus a platinum or a taxane. And we want to understand what the profile of our drug is as monotherapy.<br>
Talking about combination, we have three options here: one is chemo; one is PARP. PARP have been approved now in triple negative breast cancer.<br>Thank God something is approved in that indication, although only for a very, very small subset of patients: 15% of the patients. There is a BRCA<br>mutation part. We think there's an opportunity through the combination to have broad utility for all patients, not just for the BRCA.<br>
And then depending on whether PD-1s and PD-L1s, to your point, make it to registration, the Phase 3 trials we are going to see soon, probably this<br>year, PD-1 and PD-L1 combinations are also of interest.<br>
The third big data generation bucket for us, as you will see -- [I can't say]; we have not talked about that yet -- where we have similarly intriguing<br>data that we showed last year at the ESMO congress, we make a major effort to update our data with a longer observation period and go into<br>subgroups and making those data available.<br>
But at the same time, we want to set up protocols in anticipation of positive discussion with the authorities. Because we believe there could be a<br>path to accelerated approval as well. And upon advice and input of the regulatory authority, we would set up this protocol to reflect it. And again,<br>this study should be up and running in the next 12 months.<br>
<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
And would love to shift the conversation to urothelial. Before we do, two questions here. One: should we be thinking about a biomarker here? This<br>is targeting Trop-2. Do we need to be screening for Trop-2 expression in these patients?<br>
<b>Michael Pehl</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - President and CEO<br>
No, we don't. So we are looking for Trop-2 expression because we want to learn. We are not discriminating between patients that have or have not<br>or have high or have moderate or have low. 90% of the patients have a moderate or high expression of Trop-2.<br>
There's also -- we have a SPA, agreed protocol with the FDA. That is currently recruiting as our confirmatory study. The FDA has also clearly told us<br>they don't expect any patient stratification.<br>
That said, there is other indications other than triple negative breast cancer, other than breast cancer as such or urothelial cancer, where the Trop-2<br>expression may be lower. We know for example from prostate cancer that Trop-2 expression is around about 70%. And that's when you start to<br>scratch your head and say like maybe I should have a biomarker in the population.<br>

<hr>
<A name=79></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 8:05PM, IMMU - Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference<br>
You heard us having a press release by the beginning of 2018 where we said we are working together with the University of Wisconsin. Not just<br>because they did some initial encouraging experiments with our drug in advanced prostate cancer, but also because they have some exquisite<br>experience to determine Trop-2 expression from circulating tumor cells.<br>
So part of the effort that we have to undergo is not just having a validated assay for the future, but ideally to also have this assay from circulating<br>tumor cells so that we don't have to torture patients anymore by getting tumor samples.<br>
<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
Got you. And so maybe we can move to urothelial now. Again, a very large market, very high unmet need. Perhaps a little bit more crowded than<br>triple negative breast cancer. We have seen some data from checkpoints here where it's at least look like a rather viable strategy.<br>
Can you sort of remind us what the data we've seen to date is in terms of response rates and durability? And then again, thinking about sort of a<br>path forward in urothelial, sort of where we are today?<br>
<b>Michael Pehl</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - President and CEO<br>
Happy to do that. So we showed data of 41 patients at the ESMO congress last year. They were all obtained in patients who got -- who were either<br>relapsed or refractory to prior chemotherapy.<br>
Round about a third of these patients have received checkpoint inhibitors. And round about a third of the patients had liver mets. That is the worst<br>population of all. The observation period, I have to say, in those patients was still rather short, but still what we were able to show is a 34% response<br>rate, which by the way is higher than what checkpoints achieve in a second-line population.<br>
In a second-line population with checkpoint inhibitors, you achieve round about 20% to 25%. We had a higher response rate in a population that<br>was much later. Just wanted to make that point.<br>
<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
And even lower. I think Otezla was like 27% in I think frontline.<br>
<b>Michael Pehl</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - President and CEO<br>
And even in frontline, the results are not very much better. I agree. So that's one thing. We were able to show a 12-months duration of response,<br>which I think, again, for that population is something unheard of. And a progression-free survival of six to seven months. So that's a pretty unique<br>profile. We think this is absolutely a best-in-class asset.<br>
That said, the next step for us is to kind of re-analyze the data. That's what we are currently doing because we have a much longer observation<br>period now. Go into those subgroups, because it's encouraging to see this kind of response rates and durations overall.<br>
But what about the patients that had checkpoint inhibitors, right? Because thinking about an accelerated approval, that's what the Agency is going<br>to think about. And upon having those data at hand and publishing them.<br>
In parallel, of course, as I was trying to say, we are talking to the FDA about give us the exact definition of a patient population where you think an<br>accelerated path is achievable. And let's set up the protocol that we are working on exactly reflecting that. So that's the first step.<br>

<A name=80></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 8:05PM, IMMU - Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference<br>
The second step -- and it's not a sequential game here; I think it's a parallel game -- is there is patients, as you know, who are not platinum eligible<br>and get checkpoint inhibitors right away. So rather than having a second-line population after you have your third-line population, that's the<br>situation that we have in triple negative breast cancer. We will certainly make an effort to have both of them at the same time.<br>
Even though you may not have an approval at hand, in case there is an accelerated path and the data looks good, we just want to broaden our<br>database right from the get-go. And then, of course, again, same game. You think about frontline. In thinking about frontline, you think about two<br>things: checkpoint inhibitor combination, chemo combination. And that's, again, a data generation effort that is imminent for us.<br>
<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
Got you.<br>
<b>Michael Pehl</b> - Immunomedics, Inc. - President and CEO<br>
But we think this drug can be positioned very, very broadly. And the urothelial cancer opportunity is as big or even bigger than the triple negative<br>breast cancer opportunity.<br>
<b>Kennen MacKay</b> - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst<br>
Terrific. I think we are running up against our time limit here. So maybe we can save Q&amp;A for the breakout session that will be taking place down<br>the hall. But Michael and Michael, wanted to thank you very much for joining us today.<br>

<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thanks, Bill. Visteon had a strong fourth quarter that cap off the successful 2017.<br>
On Page 2, let me briefly cover our consolidated fourth quarter and full year results for 2017. The fourth quarter is seasonally one of our stronger<br>quarters. Despite the challenging vehicle production environment in North America, I'm pleased with our overall performance in the quarter across<br>several key metrics.<br>

<A name=84></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, VC - Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call<br>
We achieved sales of $797 million in the quarter, essentially flat over prior year. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $102 million, a quarterly record<br>for Visteon, and our 12.8% adjusted EBITDA margin was a 60 basis point improvement compared with the same quarter a year ago. The fourth<br>quarter marked our 12th consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement.<br>
Adjusted free cash flow was $58 million. We won $2.4 billion in new business in the fourth quarter, the most new business Visteon has ever won<br>in a single quarter. This included significant wins in key product areas, which I will discuss in more depth later.<br>
Our full year results were also noteworthy. Our electronic sales of $3,146,000,000 were an all-time high as was the adjusted EBITDA of $370 million.<br>Our new business wins for the year totaled $7 billion, increasing our backlog to over $19 billion at year-end. I'm very proud of the work of Visteon<br>employees around the world to generate the strong results and help us finish the year on a strong note.<br>
Moving to Page 3. On this page, I would like to discuss Visteon's sales performance for full year 2017 in light of the market environment. Overall,<br>global vehicle production volumes in 2017 increased just over 2% year-over-year, which was pretty much in line with our expectations. Regionally,<br>the results were mixed, as increases in Asia Pacific and Europe were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in production volumes in North<br>America. In South America, the market in Brazil finally leveled off and started recovery in 2017, which helped drive the double-digit growth in the<br>region.<br>
Visteon's Top 5 customers saw their volumes grow by 1.7%, slightly below market growth. With respect to Visteon sales, volume and new product<br>launches drove an increase of $258 million or about 8% over 2016. This was offset by product rolloffs of $138 million or about 4% for an organic<br>growth of nearly 4% or twice the growth of the underlying market. The impact of annual pricing negotiations with customers in 2017 was similar<br>to 2016, and combined with the low impact of currency reduced full year sales by $81 million to $3,146,000,000 or growth of 1.3% over the prior<br>year.<br>
I'm pleased with the overall performance in Visteon sales despite the uneven performance of the market. New product launches are starting to<br>offset the impact of older products reaching the end of production. And as more of our backlog starts to convert into revenue, this offset will drive<br>highest sales growth in the future as we have mentioned earlier.<br>
Turning to Page 4. On this page and the next, I will give you an update on the 2 most significant product segments in corporate electronics,<br>instrument clusters and Audio/Infotainment. Both of these segments are undergoing significant transformation and Visteon is right at the forefront<br>of these industry trends.<br>
Starting with instrument clusters. The industry is quickly transitioning toward digital clusters with growing display sizes that enable dynamic<br>information exchange using 2D and 3D graphics. The complexity and software content of this new all-digital clusters are significantly higher than<br>the older generation devices they're replacing. The dual requirements of rendering critical safety relevant information such as telltales, combined<br>with the need to render digital content, such as maps and media cover art make these all-digital clusters sophisticated computing devices.<br>
In 2017, we saw significant interest from automakers for 10-inch and 12-inch all-digital clusters, with 2D and 3D rendering capabilities. The displays<br>are continuing to improve, both in terms of size and resolution as well as other graphics capabilities. And we're starting to see demand for integration<br>of camera-based driver monitoring features in these clusters.<br>
As you can see on the right of the page, we won almost $4 billion in new business in clusters in 2017. This is our second year of exceptional<br>performance in this segment, coming on the back of similar performance in 2016. The global cluster market is about $7 billion in annual sales and<br>these back-to-back years of strong new business wins put us in a great position to improve our global market share in this segment, which currently<br>stands at 18% in 2017.<br>
A key highlight of our 2017 new business win performance was that over 60% of the wins were for all-digital clusters. This compares with 37% in<br>2016. Not only are we winning more than our fair share of the total cluster market, we're also outperforming everyone in the fastest-growing<br>segment within instrument clusters -- the all-digital segment. As a result, the average selling price of the cluster business won in 2017 is higher<br>

than that of cluster business won in 2016 by over 20%. 2017 was an outstanding year for Visteon in our instrument cluster business, and we are<br>well-positioned to continue this performance going forward.<br>
Moving to Page 5. On this page, we will discuss our performance in the Audio/Infotainment segment. The audio segment has been in decline for<br>the past few years with the progression towards more digital and display-based content in the vehicle cockpit. As one of the leading suppliers of<br>audio systems for the industry, Visteon was facing significant headwinds in this space. Also, Visteon's market share in embedded infotainment has<br>been small, based on the business that was inherited through the JCI Electronics acquisition. However, the Audio/Infotainment segment in the<br>auto industry is going through its own transformation, which is creating new opportunities for Visteon. Three new developments are changing<br>the Audio/Infotainment landscape in a significant manner. First, the success of smartphone projection technologies such as CarPlay and Android<br>Auto has created a new product category called display audio. Display audio is quickly replacing traditional audio and entry infotainment systems<br>as the default infotainment system in the cockpit.<br>
Next, the trend of equipping vehicles with connectivity to the Internet has created demand for the embedded infotainment to be a connected<br>app platform. The traditional proprietary and closed infotainment solutions from current suppliers are no longer appropriate for the market.<br>
And finally, the trend toward integrated domain controllers has created demand for integrating instrument cluster and infotainment on a single<br>electronic control unit or ECU.<br>
Suppliers with strong cluster and infotainment solutions have an inherent advantage in offering these integrated cockpit domain control solutions.<br>Our strategic initiatives in 2016 and 2017 have helped the company gain momentum in the Audio/Infotainment segment. Our acquisition of AllGo<br>Systems in 2016 has strengthened our hand in the display audio segment. The launch of Phoenix in early 2017 added to our capability in embedded<br>infotainment by offering a web application platform for mid- to high infotainment. And the SmartCore technology has been the leading solution<br>for an integrated domain controller system for the cockpit, offering integrated instrument cluster and infotainment capabilities on a single ECU.<br>
Visteon had a strong performance in audio infotainment in 2017, winning $1.5 billion in new business compared with approximately $700 million<br>in 2016. All categories: Audio, display audio and embedded infotainment, saw significant growth year-over-year. We won 2 Phoenix infotainment<br>programs, with the second win being a software-only sale to upgrade an existing infotainment system for a vehicle manufacturer in Europe. We<br>also achieved 2 SmartCore domain controller wins for integrated cluster and infotainment with vehicle manufacturers in Asia. The strong performance<br>in 2017 with new business wins, Visteon is gaining momentum in the Audio/Infotainment segment. The pipeline of new business opportunities<br>for infotainment and SmartCore looks strong and we expect our performance to continue to improve as we go forward.<br>
Moving to Page 6. Visteon had record $7 billion in new business wins in 2017, and this page provides a breakdown of this performance by product<br>and region. It also offers a view into our backlog, which stood at $19.4 billion at the end of 2017, a growth of 18% year-over-year.<br>
Our 2017 performance of $7 billion in new business was up 30% from $5.4 billion in 2016. The main drivers were the outstanding performance in<br>all-digital instrument clusters and Audio/Infotainment that we discussed on the last 2 pages.<br>
As we have mentioned on previous calls, one of our goals is to increase the average size of new business win, which ultimately drives improved<br>profitability. In 2017, we increased the average size of a new award by approximately 25%. Our performance in 2017 was also very well distributed<br>from a regional viewpoint. All regions were well represented and I was particularly pleased with the improvement in North America, which grew<br>70% year-over-year in terms of new business wins.<br>
As a result of the strong performance in 2017, our backlog at the end of the year was up 18% year-over-year, reaching $19.4 billion at year-end. It<br>should be noted that a significant portion of the backlog is made up of products that are growing faster than the market and is also oriented more<br>towards regions that are growing faster in terms of vehicle production and sales.<br>
Now turning to Page 7. In addition to delivering on our financial commitments, we are also focused on ensuring the continued success of the<br>company as the industry goes through its transformation. On this page and next, I would like to share our thoughts on the key trends impacting<br>the industry as we look ahead at 2018 and beyond.<br>

<A name=86></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, VC - Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call<br>
As we have discussed previously, the cockpit electronics segment is going through a significant transformation. Many of the trends, such as<br>digitalization of the cockpit, connected car and ECU consolidation that are shown on the top of this page are already well underway. Visteon has<br>done well in taking advantage of these trends in the past couple of years, and the strategic actions we have taken in these areas will continue to<br>position the company well going forward.<br>
In parallel, the evolution of ADAS towards autonomous driving has been making significant progress and the industry is now looking at offering<br>Level 3 automation, with features such as highway pilot and remote self-parking. In addition to the autonomous driving technology itself, Level 3<br>automation requires careful transition of the control of the vehicle between the human driver and the autonomous driving system. This is leading<br>to our conversions between cockpit electronics and autonomous driving technologies. As the leader in cockpit electronics technologies, and with<br>the launch of our autonomous driving platform earlier this year, Visteon is in a unique position to address these new requirements.<br>
Going forward, we expect cockpit electronics to require new innovations in human-machine interface to facilitate the evolution of autonomous<br>driving. These new cockpit solutions, together with the emerging Level 3-plus autonomous driving solutions is offering Visteon further opportunity<br>to grow our business.<br>
Now moving to Page 8. On this page, I would like to discuss the emerging innovations in cockpit electronics that we stressed upon on the previous<br>page. The last significant change to occur in cockpit electronics human-machine interface was driven by the introduction of infotainment technology<br>in the cockpit. This required the industry to move beyond hard buttons and knobs to touch screens, speech recognition and haptic controllers.<br>Now there is another transformation of the cockpit electronics underway, driven by the emergence of autonomous driving. This time, the changes<br>are driven by the need to keep the driver informed about the state of the external environment even while the vehicle is being controlled by the<br>system, and to hand over the control of the vehicle to the human driver in a timely manner, as required.<br>
This is driving (technical difficulty) cockpit capabilities, such as virtual reality, digital instrument clusters, driver monitoring solutions and augmented<br>reality [head of] displays. These innovations are expected to be launched in the market by 2021, coinciding with the broader launch of Level 3<br>autonomous solutions. At Visteon, we are developing these new capabilities in our cluster and autonomous driving technology platforms, shown<br>on the right of the page.<br>
At CES earlier this year, we demonstrated our next generation cluster solution that integrated driver monitoring capability. We also launched<br>DriveCore, our autonomous driving platform, which provides us with an entry point in the very important area of technology for automotive for<br>the future. As the industry moves towards autonomous driving, these cockpit electronics and autonomous driving technologies will become<br>increasingly important in winning future business. I'm pleased that we were able to make significant progress in 2017 in evolving our technology<br>platforms to stay current with the market.<br>
Moving to Page 9. On Page 9, we summarize our highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. For the fourth quarter, we delivered a strong<br>quarter, with $797 million in sales and a record $102 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing 12.8% of sales. We delivered our 12th straight quarter<br>of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin growth, and we were awarded a record $2.4 billion in new business wins.<br>
For the full year, we achieved sales of $3,146,000,000, which was up approximately 4% year-over-year considering volume and mix. Our adjusted<br>EBITDA margin increased to 11.8%, 70 basis points higher than prior year. We won a record $7 billion in new business, increasing our order backlog<br>to a record $19.4 billion. We continued to perform exceptionally well in the instrument clusters segment, winning almost $4 billion in new business,<br>and we gained momentum in Audio/Infotainment segment, winning $1.5 billion in new business or more than twice the amount last year. Our<br>domestic sales in China continued to perform very well, and were up by 21% driven by new product launches, and we exited the year with strong<br>technology platforms that are very well-positioned to address the key trends in the industry.<br>
Overall, it was a solid fourth quarter and full year for Visteon. I'm pleased with how the entire team at Visteon continues to be focused on execution<br>and operational excellence, which has delivered excellent financial results, and ultimately, value for our shareholders.<br>
That concludes my overview comments, and now Christian will walk you through our financial results for the quarter and full year.<br>

<A name=87></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, VC - Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Thank you, Sachin, and good morning, everyone. On Page 11, we present our key financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 versus<br>the comparable periods in 2016. The financials on this page reflect our ongoing Electronics Product Group and exclude discontinued and other<br>operations.<br>
As explained on prior calls, our financial results in the prior year included businesses that were exited at the end of last year and were classified<br>either in the Other Product Group or discontinued operations. We did not have nor expect to have any sales or adjusted EBITDA related to our<br>Other Product Group or discontinued operations.<br>
Electronic sales of $797 million in the fourth quarter were down by less than 1% from prior year, as a drop in North America production volumes<br>was offset by growth in other regions. Despite the modest decline in revenues, adjusted EBITDA for electronics was $102 million, representing a<br>4% increase from fourth quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 12.8%, 60 basis points higher than prior year levels and largely reflects<br>operating efficiencies across our organization. Since 2015, we've had 12 consecutive year-over-year quarterly improvements on this metric.<br>
Adjusted free cash flow for electronics was $58 million in the quarter, $21 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year due to timing of working<br>capital payments and higher capital expenditures. I will provide more detail on the full year figures on the following pages.<br>
On Page 12, we provide electronic sales and adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 versus 2016. Electronic sales for the full year were $3,146,000,000<br>or 1.3% higher than 2016 as higher volumes offset the impact of pricing. Overall, volumes and mix were up by 4% compared to global production<br>volume growth of 2%. As we have indicated during the course of 2017, we continued to generate strong revenues from China. For the full year,<br>our China domestic sales increased by 21%, while China vehicle production volumes grew 2%. We've seen a decoupling of our sales growth from<br>the market driven by our new product launches, and we expect China domestic sales to continue to grow at double-digit rate in 2018.<br>
Our adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $370 million, which if you recall, is at the top end of our guidance. This represents growth of 7% from 2016 and<br>reflects our continued ability to generate favorable cost performance in engineering, material and manufacturing costs. This cost performance,<br>together with the flow-through of new business more than offset the impact of pricing and unfavorable currency.<br>
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.8% for the year and represents an improvement of 70 basis points compared with 2016. Incremental margins,<br>which are the amount of adjusted EBITDA generated for every dollar of increase in sales were over 60%, which indicates our ability to extract<br>operational efficiencies, while at the same time invest in new technologies and execute on the new programs we have won.<br>
Turning to Page 13. Page 13 provides our cash flow. Total adjusted free cash flow for the year was $148 million, lower than prior year driven by the<br>timing of working capital payments, which will in turn benefit our cash flow in the first quarter of 2018. In fact, our adjusted free cash flow for<br>January, 2018, is one of the highest in many years and should dampen the cash outflow we typically experienced in the first quarters of every year.<br>Capital expenditures came in at a little over 3% of revenues for the full year due to 2 reasons: plant investments to cover our strong new business<br>win rate; and the higher capitalization of software development costs as we move toward more platform and software-based technologies.<br>
Our returns on invested capital are high, over 19% in 2017, and as such, the best use of our cash is investing in ourselves. Going forward, we estimate<br>that our capital expenditures will be around 3% of revenues. Free cash flow for total Visteon for the year was $118 million, which is a good<br>improvement from 2016 levels of $45 million, as we have completed separation of our legacy businesses.<br>
Cash and short-term investments at the end of the year were $709 million, and that was $393 million, which continues to put us in a net cash<br>position and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.1x. We have a strong capital structure that would enable us to compete effectively and invest in different<br>[shading] technologies while returning capital to our shareholders.<br>
Moving to Page 14. I'd like to provide an update on our capital return activities. We have authorization from our board to repurchase a total of $900<br>million in 2 tranches, $400 million authorized in 2017 and $500 million authorized in 2018. For the 2017 buyback program, we have repurchased<br>$200 million in 2017, at an average price of $101 million for approximately 2 million shares. We will be entering into a combination of open market<br>

and accelerated share repurchase programs for the remaining $200 million. In January of 2018, our board has supplemented the 2017 authorization<br>with an additional $500 million to be executed through 2020. As such, as of the end of 2017, we have $700 million of outstanding share repurchases.<br>This underscores the confidence we have in our long-term growth prospects and shows our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders.<br>Shareholder distributions will continue to be part of our capital allocation approach going forward, and as the company continues to generate<br>cash, we expect that there will be more opportunities to further return capital to our investors.<br>
And finally, last month at the Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry conference, we discussed how we are leveraging our technology leadership<br>position in cockpit electronics, as the industry transitions into autonomous driving. In that conference, we provided our 2018 guidance, which we<br>are reaffirming today. We're also reiterating our investment themes. First, our strong new business wins of $7 billion, with the significant awards<br>we had in infotainment and all-digital clusters give us increased confidence in meeting our overall long-term growth objective. Second, in 2017,<br>we delivered increased margins of 11.8% while investing in new technologies and executing on our program wins, and we continue to generate<br>adjusted free cash flow.<br>
And third, we continue to be good stewards of capital. We have executed on $200 million share repurchases in 2017, and we have $700 million<br>remaining that we will execute between now and 2020.<br>
Thank you, and let's open it up for questions.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.<br>
<b>Ryan J. Brinkman</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
And the question is about the bookings number, was extremely strong in the fourth quarter, to the layman, it would appear that you're well on<br>track to exceed the 2017 and 2018 sort of combined $12 billion number. Is that the way we should look at it? Or does it relate somehow to a different<br>cadence, some wins you thought that might land in the first quarter of '18, and in fact, fell in the fourth quarter of '17? And what does this imply<br>for your sort of, I think, it's [8.7%] sort of organic CAGR through 2021, et cetera? Are you potentially now in a position to be maybe ahead of plan?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Ryan, first of all, yes, we are very happy with our record setting performance in 2017 with respect to new business wins. What I would say with<br>respect to our longer-term revenue target is that, this performance increases our confidence, first of all, in achieving that target with the wins that<br>we've had in 2017 now, I would say, over more than 60% of the 2021 target of $4.7 billion in revenue is already in our backlog or already sourced.<br>So the way we should think of it is that our confidence in delivering our 2021 revenue target is now significantly higher. Having said that, our<br>revenue outlook depends on a few other things, such as vehicle production forecasts as well as currency. So our target for 2018 for new business<br>wins remains the same, roughly about $6 billion. The sales pipeline looks very strong, so we expect to have another strong year. And as we always<br>do, we will update our outlook for 2021 at the end of the year and then provide you with an update at the next Deutsche Bank conference. But<br>overall, again, a very strong year. We feel good about our prospects in the 2020, 2021 timeframe, as we have said earlier in this year as well. And I<br>think it also positions us well in terms of being able to deliver a strong 2018.<br>
<b>Ryan J. Brinkman</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay, great, and then just lastly from me. We saw that earlier announcement that you had won that sort of design win for SmartCore in Europe,<br>and without producing all of the associated hardware. And now today, you've got this announcement of a software-only Phoenix win. Can you<br>

kind of talk about the implications of that? Do you prefer to produce the associated hardware also? Or are you more attracted to a software or<br>design approach because of the positive implications to margin and presumably return on invested capital?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. Let me talk first about this win and then I'll also invite Christian to talk about the margin. So if you look at the sales cycle for a typical conquest<br>infotainment win, it's usually more than a year. And so we are very happy to have 2 wins in Phoenix within a year of the launch of the platform. So<br>this second win is for an European OEM, and this is for their existing infotainment systems that they wanted to upgrade to be able to host web<br>apps in a downloadable fashion. So we are providing the Phoenix runtime and the studio developer software to enable the OEM and the third<br>parties to create downloadable apps for this infotainment system. This is a software-only sale, and as such, the business model relies on a royalty<br>that we collect on a per unit basis. And since this is an existing infotainment system, the initial start of production is actually Q3 of this year. So it<br>-- I would say, it's a great validation of our software oriented approach to our platforms. It represents an acceleration of revenue and as a software-only<br>business, the margins are what you'd expect from a software business. Christian, would you like to add something?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, the only thing I would add, Ryan, is that when you think about the software only, it actually provides us the ability to experiment with various<br>revenue models, which we did not have without having this platform-based technology like Phoenix. It is also interesting to note that the hardware<br>is based on somebody else's as a competitor's hardware. So it actually gives us the ability to port our technology on somebody else's platform, so<br>which is kind of really interesting.<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
And the last thing I would add, Ryan, to your question, whether we would prefer to offer software only or along with the hardware. It really is a<br>choice that we don't get to make in most of those cases. This is the OEM in most cases that decides that. We do expect a few other opportunities<br>in this way where on account of the installed base of infotainment systems that lack the ability to offer an app environment, there is a demand for<br>the kind of software that we offer with Phoenix. But in the vast majority of the cases, we expect that the OEMs will want a complete system hardware<br>along with the software pre-integrated like what we typically would do in normal business.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question is from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Joseph Robert Spak</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst<br>
The first question I had is on free cash flow, actually, and it looks like it was a little lower, I think, driven by higher CapEx, which I believe is related<br>to just more capitalization of software development. And I guess, the question is, as you move more and more towards software-based enterprise,<br>should we think about CapEx running higher than the 3% of sales that it's typically run at? And I guess is there a corresponding offset to R&amp;D?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Joe, this is Christian. So in terms of the CapEx, just to give you the magnitude of the increase that we have, we had about $25 million increase in<br>CapEx year-on-year. But 2/3 are what you would consider normal CapEx, which is the plant equipment and so forth that we needed to support the<br>new program wins that we're having. And 1/3 of that is also -- 1/3 of the increase is the software development costs that you talked about. So going<br>forward, yes, the software development cost is actually helpful in our R&amp;D, but as you recall, when we guided in Deutsche Bank of what happens<br>in 2018, we have -- our engineering expense is expected to increase because of the incremental investments that we have in autonomous driving.<br>

<A name=90></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, VC - Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Joseph Robert Spak</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Okay, so there might be some benefit but then there's additional investment in autonomous?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Right, right, but in terms of the guidance, we think 3% is a good number for CapEx as a percent of revenue going forward.<br>
<b>Joseph Robert Spak</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Okay, and then if we look at Slide 5, where you provided the information on infotainment and the backlog, so it looks like, if you look at sort of the<br>mix shift, right, a big move to sort of display audio, and it looks like that sort of evenly taken in terms of the mix percentage anyway from regular<br>audio and embedded infotainment. And so, I would have thought from an ASP perspective, those 2 might actually offset, but you're still saying<br>that ASPs are up 10%. So I guess, within embedded infotainment, are those ASPs higher as well year-over-year?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, so the embedded infotainment ASPs are maintaining their pricing levels. So what is really happening here is that the display audio is significantly<br>higher than the audio that it is replacing, and that is what is helping the average ASP go up by about 10% for us -- for the full amount. The way to<br>think of it is, as you mentioned, we are winning in all of the 3 segments. This is a turnaround year, 2017 was a turnaround year for us in infotainment,<br>and it's really driven on account -- by the fact that we have made some investments in our platforms and then we talked about Phoenix, it scales<br>really well from entry infotainment all the way to mid-high and the strength that we have on account of the acquisition of AllGo in our -- the<br>smartphone projection capabilities, which are very important, not just for display audio segment, but also for embedded.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And your next question is from the line of David Lim with Wells Fargo.<br>
<b>Hyong Lim</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Just a couple questions, when we look at your $7 billion in win, can you parse out how much of that is conquest versus incumbent? And then, your<br>win rate from a conquest perspective? And then I have another follow up.<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
David, this is Christian. In terms of conquest and incumbent, about 70% to 80%, we would consider conquest, right, and the rest would be incumbent.<br>
<b>Hyong Lim</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
And can you give us an idea of your win rates on there? I mean is it more like a 30% or a 40% win rate when you do conquest bids or is it more than<br>that?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
I'm sorry, let me rephrase what I said, I had it reversed. So 30% is conquest and 70% would be incumbent of the $7 billion that we won.<br>

<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
And regarding the win rate question, David, so about 80% of the incumbent, we win, so that's roughly our win rate there and when it comes to<br>conquest, our win rate is closer to 50%.<br>
<b>Hyong Lim</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Got you. And then on the Phoenix software side, on the software side, I know that it is a little early but on the royalty, can you give us a little bit<br>more color, I mean, relative to, like units that you anticipate? And are we talking about $10 to $20 per car or is it something higher than that or<br>lower than that? Any kind of additional direction would be very helpful.<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. It really depends on the content. So it's hard to put a specific number. There is a lot of feature content that drives the royalty structure but it's<br>in the range that you just mentioned, it's a -- in this particular case, as we mentioned, there is an existing infotainment system. So this is adding to<br>the capabilities, especially with regard to the ability to download apps from the Internet and run them securely on the infotainment system. As we<br>go forward and there is additional features that Phoenix will deliver, including all of the base infotainment capabilities, then the value of that<br>software would increase. But in this particular case, it's in the range that we have just talked about.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question is from the line of David Leiker with Robert W. Baird &amp; Co.<br>
<b>Joseph D. Vruwink</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Associate<br>
This is Joe Vruwink for David. The all-digital cluster wins seemed notable. I think you've discussed that market growing 25% to 30%. Your new wins<br>are growing 70%. How much of the outgrowth today is barriers to entry that you sort of brought up the complexity of the product kind of boxing<br>out or excluding a lot of legacy cluster suppliers versus technology or cost leadership, you would say Visteon has even against competing companies<br>that do have a digital product but it's just not quite what you're offering?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, so Joe, first thing I would mention here is that one of the key capabilities in our a all-digital cluster, there are 2 in fact, one is the display, the<br>other is the software. And when it comes to the digital display, Visteon has always had a very strong capability in automotive digital displays. We<br>ship over $400 million worth of digital displays every year. So we have a strong capability in taking LCD panels and then treating them and bonding<br>and fabricating the automotive displays that have to withstand the conditions within the car and meet critical requirements. This is not something<br>that most players in the space have, as a vertically integrated capability. So that's one element of that. The other is the software. And then, so what<br>has happened here with software is that besides having the key capabilities in terms of the technology, we, at Visteon, have critical mass in terms<br>of supporting the specific vehicle architectures of a wide number of automakers in the world. So we have now a broad-based platform that we can<br>take to automakers that more than likely supports their requirements out of the box. That's different from, say with many other of our competitors,<br>that reduces the risk to the program, reduces our cost in developing that cluster, and this is one of the main reasons why we have won as much<br>business as we've won. This is the second year that -- in a row that we have won about $3.8 billion, $3.9 billion in clusters and when you look at the<br>market, which is on an annual basis, somewhere around $7 billion, it represents a significant market share. So we do expect, however, that as we<br>go forward, more of the automakers to transition towards all-digital. And again, momentum is a very good thing, and this should put us in a good<br>shape to win more of the business going forward in all-digital clusters.<br>

<b>Joseph D. Vruwink</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Associate<br>
And since you brought up platform. So I remember back when you took the infotainment platform at Harman and that was really the turning point<br>to getting infotainment into the Japanese automakers. Obviously, they value performance but they're also reliability cost sensitive. Do you think<br>Visteon is near a similar milestone where this first win with the Japanese automaker really opens up that industry as a totally incremental opportunity?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. We have, Joe, a few firsts when it comes to all-digital clusters. We had the first 12-inch all-digital cluster win with a Japanese OEM, which is a<br>significant step. I think this is -- this would really enable us to build and demonstrate our capability in Japan, in that market, which is a difficult<br>market for most non-Japanese suppliers to crack into. And it's a significant win, which means that's it's definitely going to put us on the map, which<br>should help us with more business wins in the future.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Deem with Longbow Research.<br>
<b>Anthony J. Deem</b> - Longbow Research LLC - Senior Analyst<br>
Couple questions for me. First, of the $1.5 billion of wins in the Audio/Infotainment in '17, are you able to specify the values for the 2 Phoenix wins<br>and the 2 SmartCore wins?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
It was really hard to hear your question. Can you please repeat?<br>
<b>Anthony J. Deem</b> - Longbow Research LLC - Senior Analyst<br>
Yes, I apologize. So I was wondering if you could specify the values for the 2 Phoenix wins and SmartCore wins out of the $1.5 billion of new business<br>wins in Audio/Infotainment this year?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. We don't typically provide specific values of new business wins. These are things that we -- normally would not be allowed to share by our<br>OEM customers, so we try to stay away from that.<br>
<b>Anthony J. Deem</b> - Longbow Research LLC - Senior Analyst<br>
Okay, I understand. And then just my last question. The shift to all-digital clusters really hit its stride in 2017. And I'm just wondering, since all the<br>digital clusters require more computing resources and it seems the interaction between the cluster and infotainment is a trend. Can you talk to<br>the potential for additional SmartCore new business wins in 2018 beyond? And really it's just -- has the bid presence dramatically increased? Or<br>do you see this more as an opportunity of a gradual increase in wins because of the long leave cycle and transitioning to a single ECU?<br>

<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. So you are absolutely right that this move towards all-digital clusters really drives demand for increased computing resources, including<br>processors, memory and software. And the need is really driven by the sort of the drive towards rendering digital content in the clusters and<br>information that comes typically from an infotainment system. As we see more of these types of solutions, that is also a big sort of a driver behind<br>the integration of infotainment and the cluster because it's a lot more effective to have those 2 systems run off of a single electronic control unit<br>or ECU to be able to share that information seamlessly between the 2 displays. Now as we have, I think, in my prepared script mentioned that the<br>momentum in cockpit domain controllers is also picking up, and the pipeline of new opportunities for 2018 is very robust. In fact, it has never been<br>greater. So we are very optimistic about having more success with SmartCore that integrates infotainment and cluster on the single ECU as we go<br>forward here in 2018 and beyond.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question is from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.<br>
<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Just looking through your pricing for the full year and kind of back into the fourth quarter, it looks like it was running about negative 3.5% maybe<br>for the quarter. I think it's a little bit worse than what we saw in the third quarter. Are those concessions concentrated with any particular product<br>lines or geographies? And what type of run rates should we be thinking about going forward?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, so David, this is Christian, let me take that one. Pricing, as you know, David, is an interesting dynamic in the auto industry. The impact of pricing<br>in any quarter is dependent on the negotiations that we have, with individual OEMs and the programs that they relate to. So as such, there could<br>be a lot of unevenness between quarters. Now having said that, if you look at the entire year, the impact was $86 million or a little bit above 2.5%<br>of revenues, which is in line with our historical rate. So I think we should just look at that in that fashion.<br>
<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Okay, so no incremental pressure to be thinking about. Sachin, obviously, you guys launched DriveCore at CES so far, you signed up one manufacturer.<br>What have you seen so far from an interest level? And how do we go about monetizing this platform over the next couple of years?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, David, very good question. And then let me try to describe to you the way we see the opportunities in autonomous. So if you look at the<br>industry and some of the things that you're hearing in media, there are really 2 sort of directions that the industry is taking. On one side, there is<br>this push towards fully autonomous, perhaps in more limited domains intended for application such as robot access and for freight movers in<br>trucks that have a point-to-point limited by sort of a specific geofenced area. So that's one initiative. The other initiative is targeted more towards<br>consumer car owners. And in this area, the goal is to upgrade the current Level 1, Level 2 ADAS capabilities into Level 3, more automated driving.<br>So at Visteon, we are really focused on working with our traditional long-term customers in enabling and upgrading Level 1, Level 2 into Level 3.<br>Now the key features there that we expect to be of initial interest would be highway pilot and remote self-parking. So what we are doing now is<br>we're very focused on developing a very cost-effective solution based on DriveCore that meets the requirements of highway pilot and self-driving.<br>And so this is where we would expect as we go -- as we make more progress in releasing these capabilities and launching these features, we'd<br>expect to see more business opportunities with OEMs that we have started engagement in. The interest is extremely high. We are just as cautious<br>in terms of who we work with and who are the right partners for us as much as anything. Because again, there's a lot of activity in this industry in<br>this regard, at the same time, resources are limited. So we are carefully sorting through the opportunities and making sure that we are partnering<br>

with the right set of OEMs. And we'll update you as we go along but so far, we have talked publicly about GAC and we are in discussions with a<br>few others in parallel at the same time.<br>
<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just lastly, as we switch over to software-only Phoenix infotainment win. Can't recall if you noted this already,<br>it was incumbent on someone else's hardware, is that on a display audio or an embedded infotainment platform?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
No, no, it was an embedded infotainment system. It was provided by another supplier to them. And what we have effectively done here is to give<br>them a platform that allows them to support downloadable apps, and that is really where we see the industry head for embedded infotainment<br>and Phoenix is one option for them to be able to get to that solution fairly quickly.<br>
<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
That's fair. How many developers do you have live on that Phoenix Studio platform today?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I would say...<br>
<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
I would imagine that is the selling point, right?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, yes, I would say that our infotainment development team, because we have it all under one global team, I would say that's probably on the<br>order of a couple of hundred developers at this point in time.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And your next question is from Colin Langan with UBS Securities.<br>
<b>Colin Langan</b> - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director in the General Industrials Group and Analyst<br>
Just looking at margins. I think you've talked about getting to 14% over time. Guidance for this year is relatively flat. I mean, what are the drivers?<br>Is it really now at this point depending on the inflection in the sales backlog? Or do you still see more cost opportunities? I know in the past, you've<br>talked about your kind of higher than average on SG&amp;A. Are you now in line? Or what's the opportunity left for margin?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Right, so Colin, this is Christian. If you think about the opportunities between where we are right now, a little short of 12%, 11.8% to the 14%, they're<br>really 3 buckets. One is cost efficiency such as you've pointed out, the other one is shift to software platform-based offerings that has accretive<br>

pressure on our margins, and the third is fixed cost leverage as we get bigger at a higher revenue base. If you think about the margin progression,<br>from where we are to the 14% target that we've communicated, the fixed cost leverage will happen towards the back end of that as we get -- as<br>we translate or generate the revenues from our backlog. And so that would come in later. The other one is the shift to lower software and<br>platform-based offerings. It's still quite nascent. And as such, the improvement in margins for the first few years before that 5-year plan of 2021<br>will be coming from cost efficiencies.<br>
<b>Colin Langan</b> - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director in the General Industrials Group and Analyst<br>
Okay. I mean, so do you still see a pretty meaningful cost opportunity at this point?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, yes, when you think about the incremental margins that we are looking at between the 11.8% to 14%, it's the incremental margins around<br>less than 20%, right? So as such we still believe that there's cost efficiencies that could -- that we could generate from our current fixed cost structure.<br>
<b>Colin Langan</b> - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director in the General Industrials Group and Analyst<br>
And are you still above average on SG&amp;A relative to your benchmark peers or do you think that part of the equation (inaudible)?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Right. So if you think about what happened this year for SG&amp;A, we had a modest increase in revenues. However, SG&amp;A was flat, right? So that means,<br>we continue to see leverage on top of that. So we believe that we can continue to, even if it in a flattish revenue, flattish SG&amp;A cost level. As we<br>increase our revenues, then our SG&amp;A as a percent of sales would actually come down.<br>
<b>Colin Langan</b> - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director in the General Industrials Group and Analyst<br>
Got it. And just lastly, how should we think about the cadence wins for SmartCore, Phoenix and then DriveCore? I mean it seems like SmartCore, I<br>think, it had 2 this year, 2 the prior year, Phoenix 2 this year? Should we -- should I start to accelerate or is this just sort of steady as you go?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, Colin, this is Sachin. So yes, as I said, that the cycle of, the sale cycle I should say for infotainment is usually more than a year. So now, you would<br>expect that we would start to see a pickup in activity with respect to infotainment new business activity and new business wins. The same for<br>SmartCore. SmartCore has seen a sort of continuous increase in momentum with automakers and the pipeline in both infotainment and SmartCore<br>looks pretty strong. So I would expect that we would see a pickup in new business activity for those 2 products. With respect to DriveCore, again,<br>it's relatively new for us and for the industry. So there's a lot of discussions that need to happen and business models that need to evolve. So I<br>would say that, that is still in a prebusiness-development phase. I would expect more sort of a pick up to offer perhaps later in the year or early<br>next.<br>
<b>William M. Robertson</b> - Visteon Corporation - VP of Operations, Finance and IR<br>
And with that, thank you, Sachin; thank you, Christian; and thank you to all for calling in to the Visteon Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I will be available<br>later today to take any questions. So please feel free to contact me. And at this point, we will end our call. Thank you.<br>

<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Thank you, Mike. Good morning. I'd like to thank you all for joining the PRA Health Sciences conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and full<br>year 2017 financial results.<br>
I'm pleased to report that the fourth quarter of 2017 was another strong quarter with double-digit revenue, adjusted net income and net new<br>business growth. Service revenues for the fourth quarter were approximately $569 million, which represents an increase of approximately 38%<br>year-over-year at actual foreign exchange rates and 36% on a constant currency basis. Service revenues, excluding Symphony, increased approximately<br>20% year-over-year at actual foreign exchange rate and 19% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was<br>approximately $69 million, an increase of approximately 50% over the same period last year. Our adjusted net income per diluted share was $1.04,<br>a 47% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2016.<br>
Net new business increased approximately 10% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. We had a record of $647 million of net new business<br>awards, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.3x of Service revenue, and this is despite unusually high cancellations of $132.6 million during the<br>quarter. The addition of our new awards has resulted in our backlog increasing approximately 4% on a sequential basis and 20% year-over-year,<br>finishing at approximately $3.5 billion.<br>
We will not be including our Data Solutions segment in our reported new business awards and backlog due to the short-term nature of these<br>contracts. The diversity of our new business awards continues to be consistent with previous quarters with approximately 60% of our new awards<br>coming from the pharmaceutical sector and approximately 40% coming from the biotechnology sector. Our client base also continues to be well<br>diversified with our top 5 clients representing approximately 37% of our total revenue for the quarter, with our largest client representing<br>approximately 9% of total revenue.<br>
Our full year 2017 financial results continued a trend of consistent and strong growth. We reported solid revenue growth and improved our overall<br>operating margins. With our full year service revenues of approximately $1.9 billion, representing growth of approximately 23% on an actual and<br>constant currency basis. Revenue growth, excluding Symphony Health, was approximately 18% at actual rates and approximately 17% on constant<br>currency basis.<br>
During 2017, we made significant investments in our business and expanded our Service offerings. We believe that we've established a foundation<br>that will allow us to provide long-term sustainable growth. I believe we are well positioned to offer a wide variety of services to our clients. Our<br>acquisition of Symphony Health has gone very well and I am delighted with the performance. We look forward to the continued opportunities that<br>this strategic acquisition will provide in the future.<br>
During Q1 2018, we'll be formally finalizing our integration plan and will be working on completing integration by the end of 2018. Due to our<br>solid performance in 2017, we are anticipating our 2018 diluted adjusted earnings per share to be between $4 per share and $4.15 per share. As<br>discussed in our press release, this guidance includes the impact of adopting the new revenue standard, the impact of the enactment of the Tax<br>Cuts and Jobs Act and updated foreign exchange rates become estimates. Linda will provide additional details about our 2018 guidance later in<br>the call.<br>
In closing, I would like to thank our entire staff and our clients for their continued commitment to PRA Health Sciences. We are delighted with our<br>strong financial results, and believe we are well positioned for strong growth in 2018.<br>
I would now like to hand over the call to Linda Baddour, our Chief Financial Officer, who will go through our quarterly and full year financial results<br>in more detail.<br>

<b>Linda Baddour</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Corporate Secretary &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
Thank you, Colin. Good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2017, our consolidated service revenues grew 37.5% at actual foreign exchange<br>rate and 35.9% on a constant currency basis. We reported $568.8 million of service revenue for the quarter compared to $413.6 million for the same<br>quarter last year. As Colin mentioned earlier, PRA revenue, excluding Symphony Health, increased 20.2% year-over-year at actual foreign exchange<br>rate and 18.6% on a constant currency basis.<br>
Revenue by segment for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $497.3 million for the clinical research segment and $71.5 million for the data solutions<br>segment. Revenue concentrations, excluding our Data Solutions segment revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2017 was consistent with prior quarters.<br>We derived approximately 56% of our Service revenue from large pharmaceutical companies, approximately 14% from the small-to-midsize<br>pharmaceutical companies, approximately 16% from large biotechnology companies and approximately 14% from all other biotechnology<br>companies.<br>
Total direct costs were $368.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $274.4 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in direct<br>costs was primarily related to an increase in labor-related costs in our Clinical Research segment as we continue to hire billable staff to support our<br>current portfolio of studies and our future growth. Our Data Solutions segment reported $40.2 million of direct costs in the fourth quarter of 2017.<br>Total direct costs were 64.9% of Service revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 66.3% in the same quarter last year. The decrease in<br>direct costs as a percentage of Service revenue, is primarily due to the higher gross margins in our Data Solutions segment Service offerings<br>compared to our Clinical Research Service offerings. On a constant currency basis, total direct costs increased by $86.6 million year-over-year. This<br>increase in our cost base included an unfavorable foreign currency effect of $7.9 million when compared to 2016.<br>
SG&amp;A expenses were $92.2 million or 16.2% of Service revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 17% of Service revenue for the same<br>quarter last year. A decrease in SG&amp;A as a percentage of Service revenue, is related to our continued efforts to effectively leverage our selling and<br>administrative functions. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we incurred transaction-related expenses of $75.9 million, which were primarily related<br>to changes in the fair value of earn-out liabilities associated with our acquisitions. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we also incurred $13 million<br>of transaction-related costs. These costs were primarily related to nonrecurring stock-based compensation expense, and the vesting of certain<br>performance-based options related to our November 2016 secondary offering.<br>
Adjusted net income, which excludes...<br>
(technical difficulty)<br>
...items whose fluctuation from period to period does not necessarily correspond to changes in our operating results, increased 49.9% year-over-year<br>to $68.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income per diluted share grew 46.5% to $1.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017<br>compared to $0.71 per share in the same quarter last year.<br>
For the 12 months ending 12/31/2017, our Consolidated Service revenues grew approximately 23% at actual foreign exchange rates on a constant<br>currency basis. We finished the year with approximately $1.9 billion of Service revenues compared to $1.6 billion in the comparable prior year. PRA<br>revenue, excluding Symphony Health, increased approximately 18% year-over-year at actual foreign exchange rates and approximately 17% on a<br>constant currency basis.<br>
Cash provided by operations was $102.6 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2017, compared to cash provided by operations of $93.3<br>million for the same period of 2016. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operations was $220.4 million compared to<br>$160 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in operating cash flow was the result of an increase in our operational performance, reduced<br>interest payments and optimization of our working capital.<br>
Our net days sales outstanding was 20 days at December 31, 2017, compared to 19 days at December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures were $22<br>million for the fourth quarter compared to $7.5 million for the same period of 2016. Capital expenditures were $61.3 million for the 12 months<br>ended December 31, 2017 compared to $33.1 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016.<br>

<hr>
<A name=101></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, PRAH - Q4 2017 PRA Health Sciences Inc Earnings Call<br>
The increase in our capital expenditures versus 2016 reflects our continued investment in information technology, enhancing our current facilities<br>and expanding our infrastructure to support our growth. Our cash balance was $192.2 million at the end of fourth quarter, of which, $63.6 million<br>was held by our foreign subs. Net debt outstanding, defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, 2017, was $1.16 billion<br>compared to $691.8 million at December 31, 2016. The overall increase in our net debt is attributable to borrowings related to our recent acquisitions.<br>
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we were able to call and retire our senior notes, which will reduce our interest expense in 2018. In addition, in<br>January 2018, we entered into 2 new interest rate swaps in order to minimize our exposures of variable rate debt. Regarding the geographic<br>concentration of our revenue, 62% of our quarterly Service revenues were earned in North America. At December 31, 2017, 82% of our Service<br>revenues were denominated in U.S. dollars and 63% of our total expenses were denominated in U.S. dollars, which is consistent with prior quarters<br>and consistent with 2016 levels.<br>
Our euro exposure continues to be naturally hedged. We currently do have exposure to movements in the GBP as approximately 1% of our revenue<br>is denominated in GBP, while 6% of our expenses are denominated in GBP. We are currently working on ways to reduce this exposure.<br>
Now let's turn our -- to our guidance for 2018. As discussed in our press release, effective January 1, we are adopting the provision for ASC 606.<br>ASC 606 requires that we apply percentage of completion accounting to Service revenues, Reimbursement revenue and investigator grants as one<br>performance obligation. The inclusion of reimbursable out-of-pocket costs and investigator fees in the calculation of revenue may create a timing<br>difference between the amount we are entitled to receive from our customers and the amount of revenue we recognize in our financial statements.<br>The variability and magnitude of this timing difference compared to our current accounting is dependent on the progress of the Service portion<br>of our project compared to the progress of the investigator fees, and the reimbursable out-of-pocket costs relative to the respective forecast cost<br>over the life of the project. Although the adoption of ASC 606 will have a material impact on our reported revenue, we do not expect the adoption<br>to have a material impact on our GAAP net income, adjusted net income or related earnings per share. Should actual results differ from our current<br>expectations, we will update our future guidance.<br>
We are estimating Service revenues between $2.84 billion and $2.95 billion representing, as reported, growth of 46% to 51% and constant currency<br>growth of between 18% and 20%, excluding the impact of ASC 606. As Colin mentioned, we had unusually high cancellations in the fourth quarter<br>of 2018, which were mainly due to one of our large pharma clients (inaudible) had been the drug development plans. Unfortunately, these studies<br>were due to start in the beginning of 2018 and had a negative impact on our revenue growth for the year. Despite these cancellations, we are still<br>projecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 10% to 12%, excluding the impact of ASC 606. As Colin mentioned, our strong book-to-bill<br>during 2017 has set us up nicely to deliver double-digit revenue growth in 2018. We are anticipating diluted GAAP earnings per share between<br>$2.80 per share and $2.95 per share, and diluted adjusted earnings per share between $4 per share and $4.15 per share.<br>
Our diluted earnings per share estimates $0.04 to $0.06 of benefit from reduced interest expense related to the retirement of our senior notes;<br>$0.03 to $0.05 of additional depreciation expense due to increased levels of CapEx during 2016 and 2017; and a full year of Symphony Health<br>depreciation; $0.03 to $0.05 of costs associated with anticipated investment to be made in Japan and China; and $0.08 to $0.12 of tax benefit as a<br>result of the changes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act offset by -- this is offset by $0.08 to $0.10 of unfavorable foreign exchange impact,<br>primarily related to the GBP.<br>
We anticipate our annual effective income tax rate will be approximately 24%, which incorporates the changes expected from the Tax Cuts and<br>Jobs Act, which was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our effective tax rate may differ from this estimate, if the geographic dispersion of our<br>pretax earnings change from what we have estimated or if there are changes in interpretation, analysis or if additional guidance is issued related<br>to the Tax Cuts and Job Act.<br>
Regarding Q1 2018 guidance, we are estimating Service revenues between $688 million and $708 million, representing as reported growth of 61%<br>to 65%, constant currency growth of 28% to 30%, excluding the impact of ASC 606, and constant currency organic growth of 12% to 14%, excluding<br>the impact of ASC 606. We are anticipating diluted GAAP earnings per share between $0.49 and $0.55 per share and diluted adjusted earnings per<br>share between $0.81 and $0.86. Similar to our full year guidance, we are anticipating our annual effective income tax rate will be 24%. Consistent<br>with 2017, we are including Q1 guidance to ensure that expectations around sequential quarterly earnings growth are in line with our expectations.<br>This guidance includes the impact of enhancing our staff to meet our current workload; an increase in depreciation expense as previously discussed;<br>

the seasonality in our data solutions segment and the negative impact of first quarter recurring expenses, such as payroll taxes and employee<br>benefits and expenses incurred related to internal organizational meetings.<br>
Finally, our guidance assumes a euro exchange rate of $1.25 and a British pound exchange rate of 1.37. All other foreign currency exchange rates<br>are as of January 31, 2018. Our process for determining exchange rates is consistent with prior years, where we use several bank resources to<br>evaluate expected rate movements for the next 12 months.<br>
This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now happy to take your questions.<br>
Operator, you may open the line for questions.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Windley of Jefferies.<br>
<b>David Howard Windley</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Colin, your comments around -- both of your comments around the higher cancellations. I'm wondering if you can provide any color around those.<br>Were those studies that you had assigned some risk adjustment to as your practices typically do? And then broadening out a little bit, as you think<br>about potential M&amp;A among your client base, how might you be able to protect yourself against some added volatility or heightened volatility, if<br>this type of activity continues?<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Thank you, Dave. Obviously we're not immune to cancellations. But that's -- actually was more of a -- the client's -- during our reprioritization, where<br>there were -- one was a change in the [current outcome] of the study that either -- whether it's regulatory or -- and as -- looks as if it'll be coming<br>back later on in the year. We just don't know when. And we prudently have -- take as a cancellation. There was another one where we decided to<br>do a different study within the portfolio and reprioritize. So that's changing again. It'll be coming back in the future. And we also saw a little bit up<br>trend. There was a few slippages as we were going through Q1. And so we wanted to deflect being -- but prudent in our forward-looking, particularly<br>in Q1, because we did expect a few other studies to be up and running much, much more quicker. So Dave, I think the best protection we can have<br>is continuing to have a well-diversified portfolio. We have got a significant number of clients. Typically, we have been fortunate enough that when<br>things are slipping, other things are accelerating. It just seems that the last quarter things were all going in the one direction which was a lot more<br>on the negative side. And saying that, we felt very good about everything. Has allowed us to be careful in our hiring. And actually go through and<br>address areas where we've got a little bit of overstaff and watching -- and go about pruning. So all in all, we've taken advantage of that situation<br>and still delivering what we feel is very strong growth.<br>
<b>David Howard Windley</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Got you. If I can ask one follow-up on one of the last points you made on staff, and how some of the slippage and cancellations might impact labor<br>utilization. I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about continuing to hire to support your growth rate. Could you get a little more precise<br>about hiring pace and levels of utilization? And how we should think about how quickly you're hiring in light of the fact that this creates a little bit<br>of slack in utilization?<br>

<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Well, actually what was noticed in the last number of quarters is that our attrition rate has actually slowed down. And normally, we're always hiring,<br>but the way of hiring is just been changing a little because of our attrition rate. We -- we've tried to hire heads. We never know exactly which country<br>are going to be utilized, which therapeutic area of expertise. And so we try to obviously try -- look at the portfolios and try to make sure that for all<br>of our key clients we get the right people in the right places at the right time. Sometimes that gets a little bit out of sync and then we address that<br>periodically. Obviously, this -- a little bit of slippage here. We've had some cancellations and some projects waiting has given us an opportunity to<br>just reassess. We're still -- obviously got to hire for all the new studies coming onboard. And a lot of these people that were hired will be earmarked<br>for later on. We just actually have adjusted the team number and size so that we can be -- we'll be ready for starting when the clients are ready.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Tim Evans of Wells Fargo.<br>
<b>Timothy Cameron Evans</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - VP and Senior Equity Analyst<br>
Linda, just with all the moving parts on revenue, I was trying to triangulate on what we should be thinking about for EBITDA margin, and kind of<br>how that compares to 2017? And what I was coming up with was an EBITDA margin under ASC 606 or something like 15% to 16% for the full year<br>with that being materially lower in the first quarter, and then stepping up meaningfully through the year. I guess, a, is that the right way to look at<br>it? And then if not, could you maybe help us out with kind of what you're thinking about for interest expense and some of the other below-the-line<br>items, any other -- other expenses might be factored into the model that would help us triangulate better on the -- on what the EBITDA margin is<br>going to look like?<br>
<b>Linda Baddour</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Corporate Secretary &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
On your adjusted EBITDA margin, you're right on point. It's somewhere between 15% and 16% for the year. It's closer to 15% for the year, but it<br>moved, as you said. It begins -- the Q1 is down and then it builds all the way to 16% and almost 17% in the fourth quarter. So that's where -- the<br>best way to look at it. And below the line, we've got our -- nothing unusual except for the fact that depreciation expense is much increased over<br>last year, and so it's closer to $40 million for the year.<br>
<b>Timothy Cameron Evans</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - VP and Senior Equity Analyst<br>
Got it. And just on kind of the ramp on EBITDA margin through the year. The Q1, is that because of the dynamics that you just talked about with<br>Dave? Or is that -- or is there really some seasonality in the business? I know we saw this trend coming from the last year...<br>
<b>Linda Baddour</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Corporate Secretary &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
It's primarily related to the seasonality. We've got these 2 enormous meetings that we do, which we think are extremely valuable to the business.<br>We do a corporate-wide meeting in January that we combine with a sales meeting, and then we also have an R&amp;D summit where we invite all of<br>our clients to -- but they both pay off dividends throughout the year so it's very, very important to us. And then you -- of course, you've got your<br>PTO accruals that kick in, your payroll taxes and we're -- or 89% payroll expense with our company, so anytime you have a big movement in that<br>in the beginning, it affects your profitability. And then finally, we are actually, as Colin mentioned, we still have to hire up in certain areas of the<br>business. And then in other areas, we may have it -- to a lesser extent, we are evaluating, maybe looking at some -- not -- slowing down the hiring.<br>So -- but I get that the profitability in Q1 is primarily -- and also with our Data Solutions segment, there is a very slow quarter for that particular<br>business unit.<br>

<b>Timothy Cameron Evans</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - VP and Senior Equity Analyst<br>
Okay. Last question real quick on EBITDA margin. Do you -- at some point I think you were saying, maybe we would get some color on the Data<br>Solutions EBITDA versus the core CRO EBITDA. Is -- have you decided to basically just stick with a consolidated EBITDA going forward or are we<br>going to get some segment breakout at some point?<br>
<b>Linda Baddour</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Corporate Secretary &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
No, I don't recall saying that we would ever get into segment break out...<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
I think Tim, all we did say is that in the first year you would see some information when we publish that. And -- but we don't intend to get a -- to<br>show it down to EBITDA, because we are consolidating everything. And we think that it's going to be very much integrated with the way we run<br>our business. But obviously, just for the reporting requirements for first year, there will be a breakout. And that'll give you some idea, but there'll<br>nothing else going forward.<br>
<b>Michael J. Bonello</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - SVP of Accounting and Corporate Controller<br>
And Tim, you'll see when we file our 10-K that we'll have segment disclosures broken down to gross margin for both of those separate segments.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell of Baird.<br>
<b>Eric White Coldwell</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst<br>
On Symphony, I think we've addressed this in different ways, but I'll be more direct. They did about $72 million in the quarter. You had guided to<br>$60 million at the midpoint. So obviously, pretty massive upside. My question is how sustainable is that in 2018? Should we model growth off this<br>space for the fourth quarter of '18? Or maybe step-up our quarters throughout the year? Honestly, I'm just not sure what to make of that, given<br>that makes up such a big quarter, but they also had a pretty massive earn-out they were shooting for. So I'm just trying to figure out how sustainable<br>that is on a full year basis?<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Eric, yes, this is a very seasonal business. The best months are the last months of every quarter, and the best quarter is the fourth quarter of the<br>year. Obviously, we are very pleased that they are out performance. How sustainable is it? Well, you can't take full quarter and multiply by 4. That's<br>for sure. It ramps up during the year. We tried date to that. That -- it was very seasonal. It's -- they -- our clients typically will [rewind] it most of the<br>data towards the end of a year. And you're not going to see at fourth quarter a performance at all the time. Obviously, as it's our first year of operating<br>with them and we've got a reasonably good budget for going forward, but I -- it should ramp up pretty steadily throughout the year. And hopefully,<br>we can see the same sort of impact in Q4 next year. But obviously, we're excited to see the prospect of that. And we're booking through our<br>integration plans. We're going to see how we can help them even accelerate that over time. 2018, as we said, was always a year of -- as our turnaround,<br>it was a little bit -- we saw a little bit maybe more tentative. And before we actually get the [full] synergies the following year.<br>

<b>Eric White Coldwell</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And Colin, can you give us any additional detail on how you plan to integrate the business? What the -- maybe what the steps are over the<br>next 4 quarters as we think about you bringing this more closely aligned to your clinical operations?<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Sure. Step one, with as of January 1, we took over running the financials. By the end of Q1, we do a revenue recognition. So (inaudible) pieces of it<br>was taken over -- on January 1. The revenue piece is just a little bit slower. As we're rebuilding the models for and the PRA's traditional models.<br>Then we are just working with all -- a number of different groups as we look through for opportunities. I mean this was never a synergistic cost-cutting,<br>savings. This is always about synergies by creating new opportunities. And we can see that we can leverage a lot of our data analysts to help produce<br>more consultancy types of revenues with like pharma and even biotech. We were looking to see how we can utilize our data better. We'll be<br>streamlining some of our data costs. We'll be utilizing a lot of their capability to actually save the whole company to make [extra] cost. So during<br>the year, we'll be looking at these very stages. I obviously don't want to interfere with that earn-out, which is why we're going to be taking it a little<br>bit slowly during the year, and doing it in a much more deliberate fashion. If they've got spare capacity to accelerate that, we will. But we'll be very<br>cautious with it. And that's why we're just a bit now -- that we want it completed by the end of the year, but obviously, just treading slowly in that<br>one.<br>

Our next question comes from Michael Baker of Raymond James.<br>
<b>Michael John Baker</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Health Care Services Analyst<br>
As a follow-up to the last conversation, was just wondering at this point if you've identified specific customer deliverables from uniting Symphony<br>with the core CRO business?<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
There have been, yes, because we're able to leverage our book of business and some of our clients are going to be switching over to getting data<br>from Symphony. So we're excited with that. And we've not been actively going out and selling that yet. But it's something that's part of our<br>integration plan that -- how we do our approach. So yes, we're very pleased that we've been probed by some of our clients is to say, &quot;Well, since<br>we are, got a close relationship with you, we want to start using Symphony's data.&quot; Other than that, we've not really, as I said, pressed the marketing<br>on it yet.<br>
<b>Michael John Baker</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Health Care Services Analyst<br>
And then in your prepared remarks, you kind of indicated that you've expanded some of your service offerings. Can you give us some color on<br>what's occurred or happened on that front?<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Well, obviously with the data we are offering a wider service. It helps us move into more real-world evidence, and health economics and outcomes<br>leased-out type of models. It is a capable -- there's other capabilities that we've added like when we've acquired Parallel 6, which has given us a<br>mobile access to patients and a platform to collect data. And so we are obviously offering that expansion. And it gives us a complete end-to-end<br>solution for our clients. And so we'll be working with that. So yes, overall, we feel pretty good about our new service offering using and embracing<br>our technologies.<br>

Our next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair.<br>
<b>Courtney Patrice Owens</b> - William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Associate<br>
This is Courtney Owens on for John Kreger. So our first question, if you can kind of speak to kind of what are your goals for leverage kind of by the<br>end of 2018, that would be great.<br>
<b>Michael J. Bonello</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - SVP of Accounting and Corporate Controller<br>
We -- we're expecting to make -- obviously, we have mandatory payments that we have to make. But we're hoping to make somewhere in the<br>range of -- somewhere between $225 million and $250 million worth of debt payments during the year.<br>
<b>Courtney Patrice Owens</b> - William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Associate<br>
Okay, got it. And then just kind of jumping back over to kind of hiring. So have you guys seen any pickup in kind of wage inflation or anything like<br>that or any kind of different trends that you've kind of seen over the past like 12 months or so?<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Nothing that we felt was excessive. And there obviously are some countries that we have to watch and be very careful where there's high inflation,<br>particularly in Latin America where obviously you're seeing that -- that -- you get 25%, 30% increase in salaries, which we've got to adjust. So other<br>than that, which we remodel and we obviously look for, at all of the inflation indices for all the 80 countries we work in. And we monitor that. Our<br>goal is to make sure that we retain our staff so we've got to watch every country's inflation rate and take appropriate actions. But we've not saw<br>anything that is -- has been a significant change. In fact, we've been quite pleasantly surprised that the wage inflation is not as high as it has been<br>in the past.<br>

Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays.<br>

So I want to follow-up on Symphony. Now that you've had it in-house for 6 months, I was wondering if you could weigh in on just some updated<br>thoughts on how you intend to grow the segment? And your level of desire to continue adding through M&amp;A to this business?<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
We are very excited, as you can imagine, Derik, (sic) [Jack], with the acquisition. We are only just getting to the point of looking at how we're going<br>to grow in. And we've got lots of plans. We want to go internationally. We want to increase our service offerings. And we're just starting integration<br>plan because obviously we now know we've got to allow them to continue to manage the business without distracting them. But they're excited<br>to actually start the integration planning now as well. So it seems a natural time that we're through the Q1. We're through the start of the year's<br>planning. And now we're looking forward to bringing and combining the talents of both of the organizations and streamlining and projecting<br>

<b>Jack Meehan</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - VP and Senior Research Analyst<br>
Great. And just on the new business front in the quarter, were there any trends you noticed in terms of either full service versus FSP? And just any<br>quality of commentary would be great?<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Typically, our -- when we look at our book of -- our RFP volume, our Q1 is normally a little bit lower as -- than the rest of the year. It picks up as we<br>go through it. So compared with last year, it's still very compatible. And so we're seeing nothing there that is different. What -- most of it -- the RFP<br>volume we're seeing is in the product registration, traditional model. We're seeing some good progress in sales for our early Development Services.<br>And we're seeing a couple -- we have always got couple of opportunities that are slow burns in our strategic solutions. They happen over a period<br>of time. And that's a -- it's quite a long consultative sale process. But there's always a couple of nice, interesting opportunities. But across-the-board,<br>we're seeing very much similar to what we've been seeing in the last couple of years, actually.<br>

<b>Michael J. Bonello</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - SVP of Accounting and Corporate Controller<br>
We will be providing that one. It's -- we're required because we're adopting on a modified prospective basis to include that disclosure in our financial<br>statements. So you will be able to see that.<br>
<b>Juan Esteban Avendano</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
So you'll be providing that in a filing?<br>
<b>Michael J. Bonello</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - SVP of Accounting and Corporate Controller<br>
Yes, we'll be filing -- we'll be including that in our disclosures in our 10-Q and our 10-K. Not the one that we're filing today, but in our future filings.<br>
<b>Juan Esteban Avendano</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
Got it. And I guess a different way of addressing this question is, would you give us details on perhaps the magnitude or seasonality or cadence of<br>reimbursable expenses throughout the year? How should we think about those?<br>

So we -- if you listen back to my remarks from today, you'll see that my guidance that I've provided did exclude the impact of ASC 606. Were you<br>on the call earlier?<br>
<b>Juan Esteban Avendano</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
Yes.<br>
<b>Linda Baddour</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Corporate Secretary &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
Yes, I did provide constant currency organic growth of 12% to 14%, excluding the impact of ASC 606 for Q1. And so I gave you the growth. Obviously,<br>you should be able -- should be able to calculate that from our results from last year. And then that was for just the Q1 guidance.<br>
<b>Michael J. Bonello</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - SVP of Accounting and Corporate Controller<br>
10% to 12% for the full year.<br>
<b>Linda Baddour</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Corporate Secretary &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
Yes, and it's 10% or 12% for the full year. So that was also excluding ASC 606. You should also be able to calculate that.<br>
<b>Juan Esteban Avendano</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
And how should we think about...<br>
<b>Linda Baddour</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Corporate Secretary &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
And there is a report -- just to reiterate, there is a requirement that during 2018, all companies provide that analysis. So that you could be able to<br>tell what your revenue would have been under the old method.<br>
<b>Juan Esteban Avendano</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
And how should we think about the net interest expense for 2018 given that you paid down a little bit of debt and also refinance some aspect of<br>it?<br>

Yes, I would think that it should be roughly between $45 million and $50 million in total.<br>

<b>Hong K Tran</b> - Cr�dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
This is actually Hong on for Erin. Just a quick one. Can you just talk about sort of your capital deployment priorities heading into 2018? Whether<br>that be sort of in the way of further IT investments, tuck-in acquisitions or in addition to some of the deleveraging that you mentioned earlier?<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
No, there's -- there's obviously, we -- [having] continued our investment in IT. We are at a point where we're going to see some implementation of<br>some systems in the middle of this year. As you know, we had to sort of delay some of the impact of the systems because of our growth and we<br>had to slow things down a little bit. Other than IT and like new office equipment and furniture and new offices, that is the bulk of our capital<br>expenditure that we've got earmarked. Regarding M&amp;A, we're obviously always looking to add initiative into our business and improve our service<br>offerings where we can or where we can see potential to utilize some of the tools that we have got internally and should deliver a better offering.<br>We've got a couple of interesting ideas, but nothing of much of scale, but there's a few things that are exciting to it that maybe come to fruition,<br>but starting off at the beginning of the year, it's hard to see whether that will happen or not. If nothing happens, we'll just continue to pay down<br>debt as Mike mentioned.<br>
<b>Hong K Tran</b> - Cr�dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Okay, great. And then just a quick follow-up for Linda. Did you by chance disclose what you expect FX impact will be on the year?<br>
<b>Linda Baddour</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Corporate Secretary &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
No, we did not. We gave you the rates that we're assuming, but we did not provide them.<br>

$0.08 to $0.10.<br>

<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Well, as you know we had a great joint venture with WuXi before and then they changed direction when they went private. Our clients have been<br>insisting that they want us to have our own operation in China. So we have been building that out. We do have a few hundred people there, but<br>we would like to have a stronger infrastructure. And so what -- we've just added a new leader for our Chinese operations and that's going to assist<br>in the growth of our China region. We're still looking if we can find the right opportunity to -- we'd acquire something as long as it met our cultural<br>and meets needs, et cetera. But we're -- there's not a lot there that we would -- we'd identify as being opportunity, however, if that did arise, it's<br>certainly something I would look at. And otherwise, we'll just continue to invest and build out organically And then in Japan, as you know we've<br>taken over the -- was able to get a JV with Takeda. We've actually brought in additional experienced people with CRO experience where that will<br>help transition as we've touched that, working with other clients within Japan. We still use some other partnerships there that we use within Japan<br>to meet our current needs. And we see that happening for the foreseeable future, while we continue to sort of build out our own infrastructure.<br>But that's an anticipated investment that we intend to happen during 2018.<br>
<b>Donald Houghton Hooker</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP and Equity Research Analyst<br>
What is the nature of the -- just last quick follow-up, but just interested, the nature of the sort of the competition on the -- Mainland China domestically<br>versus obviously in the international drug companies you're there with the other major CROs. But when you get into China, I mean, do you see a<br>change in the competitive environment? Anything notable? Just curious.<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
We're really looking to build out and instead of building local work within China, we are more concentrating on working with large global clients,<br>needing China as part of the solution. And so we've got to make sure that they meet the international capabilities and standards. And it's a different<br>type of build. And we probably wouldn't be able to compete on the lower-cost type of environment, where we've got local type of work. We want<br>everybody eventually speaking English language and working in an English-language environment, which is always difficult when you're such a<br>big country as you can imagine, it's got lots of difficulties there. But we are excited with the prospect that we've got an opportunity to build out<br>on our own way. We have talked to a couple of companies that are of some interest, but whether there's something that we can get together where<br>but we don't know. In the meantime, we've got a solution that we'll just continue to just pursue by organic growth.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we do have a follow-up question from David Windley of Jefferies.<br>
<b>David Howard Windley</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
I wanted to come back to a question on mix. And on that I'm, I guess, thinking about several different threads. The primary is FSP versus full service.<br>And Colin, you kind of commented on that. I guess I'm remembering that you talked about maybe a fairly large FSP renewal, and wanted to<br>understand if that was a fourth quarter of then or first quarter of then? And how much of that might have influenced bookings in the fourth quarter?<br>And then also the dynamic of FSP being more popular among large pharma, and full service more popular in the smaller mid-biotechs and the<br>strong financing that has flowed to biotech. I mean just trying to think about how all those issues are influencing the demand that you're seeing<br>and what you think will progress from here?<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Dave, with our fourth -- it was a fourth quarter event where we had our last client renewal. As you know, we only take 12 months off it. So nothing<br>materially affects our bookings. And the swing factor in our bookings is really the product registration piece of our business. That's where we're<br>

really getting our -- the strong RFP flow. And the strategic solutions, new opportunities are typically within our current client. And then there's<br>occasional fear that, as I mentioned, like a much more slower bond and are consulted to sale, that takes quite a while to materialize. Looking across<br>the border, I don't really...<br>
<b>Linda Baddour</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Corporate Secretary &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
With the growth in 2018, it's primarily related to the full service part. And we still have growth in our strategic solutions division, but the growth<br>primarily is from there.<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
I was looking to Linda to see what I could say on this.<br>
<b>David Howard Windley</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Yes, understood. So am I right? So my diligence suggests that a number of large pharma companies are, in fact, moving toward FSP. And so that<br>could -- within large pharma, could create a mix shift toward FSP, but then on the other hand there's more funding and more R&amp;D spending growth<br>from your small- and mid-clients that are more inclined to drive full service. And so I was trying to figure out what the equilibrium was between<br>those 2, kind of, opposing trends? And it sounds like full services is perhaps winning or slightly stronger tailwind of those 2. Is that fair?<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
I would say that's pretty fair. And I think that we just feel in a good position where we've got strong offerings in both the elements and allows us<br>to get the right mix for our -- any individual client. So we really work with them to assess their needs, and if they need a hybrid approach, we can<br>help them realign so it's not &quot;one size fits all&quot; or &quot;all eggs in one basket&quot; type of situation. We can actually flagship for them. And we can talk to<br>them about what did they really want to achieve, and then we work out a plan of how best to get there.<br>
<b>David Howard Windley</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
And then the last question. You clearly are continuing to post very strong bookings. It would seem that your competitive position is very good. I'm<br>wondering if you are seeing any changes in the competitive landscape in light of changes in competitors, go-to-market strategies? Or if things still<br>feel pretty much the same?<br>
<b>Colin Shannon</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Difficult to see any trend at this point, Dave. Obviously, it's something we watch. And I'm not seeing anything that's filtering through from the type<br>of RFP volume or anything that's a discernible trend. Our win rate is still pretty consistent. So I'm not seeing any substantial change. So at the<br>moment, I mean, we never underestimate our competition, but we're not seeing anything different...<br>
<b>Linda Baddour</b> - PRA Health Sciences, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Corporate Secretary &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
The pricing -- or no unusual pricing or anything like that.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Denbury Resources Fourth Quarter 2017 Results Conference Call. (Operator<br>Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to John Mayer, Director of<br>Investor Relations. Please go ahead.<br>
<b>John Mayer</b><br>
Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me on the call from Denbury is Chris Kendall, our President<br>and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Allen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.<br>

<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Thanks, John. I appreciate all of you for joining us today. Denbury's fourth quarter was a great demonstration of the potential of this unique company<br>and it feels like we are just getting started.<br>
We generated significant free cash flow and lowered our cost, reaching a 9-year low on G&amp;A. We underspent on capital compared to budget, grew<br>production for the second consecutive quarter, grew reserves, had a successful well with our first significant exploitation investment and improved<br>our balance sheet.<br>

<A name=115></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, DNR - Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call<br>
A 97% crude oil in our production mix, continued strengthening in the oil market drove our realized price above $55 per BOE, and crude differentials<br>turned positive, up by about $2 from the third quarter.<br>
We are on a path to significant improvement in our debt metrics, with our Q4 annualized EBITDA resulting in a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 4.5x,<br>significantly lower than where we were earlier last year, and we see a path to even further improvement over the next 2 years in a $60 oil price<br>environment.<br>
Slide 5 highlights of our accomplishments in 2017 and our 2018 priorities. You'll note that our high-level priorities are the same. We will continue<br>to build our foundation of execution, seeking to always improve the blocking and tackling of how we do our business.<br>
Part of what makes Denbury special is the diverse opportunity set that exists in our asset base, and we'll continue to pursue ways to turn that<br>opportunity into tangible value.<br>
Building on the Mission Canyon success, we plan to ramp up our exploitation activities. We also plan to drive incremental value from our surplus<br>CO2 and pipeline capacity continue (technical difficulty) a primary focus on reaching an investment decision for the initial flood at Cedar Creek<br>Anticline in the first half of this year. And we'll continue to drive greater value from our existing fields, something our teams have done very well<br>over the past years.<br>
We'll continue to build our financial strength. We plan to extend our bank credit facility this year, and Mark will share more on that later. Our Houston<br>land sale is in progress, and we expect to begin to see results as early as the second quarter. And we'll continue to maintain capital discipline,<br>spending within cash flow and maintaining a high bar on project economics.<br>
And before moving off this slide, I'd like to touch on significant compensation changes we're implementing this year. Many of the changes are<br>both at the executive and full employee base and reflect both my belief and a strong alignment between pay and performance as well as shareholder<br>feedback that we gathered over the last year. We feel that they better align compensation with company performance and growing shareholder<br>value.<br>
Key elements include a greater focus on project level returns, strengthening of the balance sheet and improving debt metrics as well as a new<br>long-term incentive award focused on debt adjusted reserves growth per share.<br>
We based our 2018 plan on a $55 oil price. As you see on Slide 7, this allows a capital budget of $300 million to $325 million, which will keep us<br>spending within cash flow. The highlighted activities in this budget are continued development at Bell Creek, developing Phase 6 in the best part<br>of that field, a 7 well Tuscaloosa infill project at the Delhi, continued EOR development at West Yellow Creek and a stepped-up exploitation program<br>where we expect to increase spending to the $30 million to $40 million range.<br>
We're planning to build off our 2017 accomplishments to continue production growth in 2018, as you see on Slide 8. 4Q was up about 1% from<br>3Q '17, and we expect full year '18 to be about 3% above '17 at the midpoint of our guidance.<br>
Looking at the table on the left side of the slide, quarter-over-quarter production increased at Delhi, Hastings and Bell Creek. In 2018, we expect<br>production to increase in most major fields, including Bell Creek, where we expect a response from the recently completed Phase 5, [CCA,] where<br>we'll continue Mission Canyon development throughout the year, Delhi with the Tuscaloosa infill development and Oyster Bayou from our just<br>completed recycle facility expansion. Hastings volumes should also increase with a full year benefit of our 2017 redevelopment project. We expect<br>first EOR production from West Yellow Creek Field early in the year, and from Grieve around midyear. Completing the picture, we'll also have the<br>benefit of a full year's ownership in Salt Creek.<br>
The extreme cold weather in the Deep South caused some power outages and impacted our January production, so we started out the year a bit<br>slower than we would've liked. We anticipate that this downtime, combined with scheduled maintenance at Delhi and Heidelberg, could cause<br>our first quarter production to be slightly lower than our fourth quarter level, but this does not affect our guidance for the full year, which was<br>finalized taking all of this into account.<br>

<A name=116></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, DNR - Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call<br>
Operating costs, shown on Slide 9, were in line with guidance, coming in on an adjusted $20.53 per barrel for the full year. We benefited from a $7<br>million CO2 price adjustment in the fourth quarter that reduced our actual full year LOE to $20.35 per barrel.<br>
Along with our focus on improving execution, our operating teams have done a great job of driving ownership of LOE to the field level, and we<br>are seeing the results in terms of high predictability as well as visibility to make LOE-impacting decisions based on economics as market conditions<br>evolve. Looking at 2018, we expect most LOE categories to remain flat with '17. Being in different basins for most of the industry and with our core<br>business focused on different activities, insulates us from much of the cost inflation we see across the industry. We do see upward cost pressure<br>in 2 primary categories. The first being power, where utility providers in some of our operating areas have increased their electricity rates; and the<br>second is CO2, where higher oil prices will have a CO2 price impact, but we see that as a good thing as it means our overall business is that much<br>better.<br>
Considering these 2 elements, we expect per barrel LOE to increase by around $0.50 per barrel from 2017. A key takeaway on LOE is that our<br>improved control and visibility into LOE helps us make conscious, economic choices that generate the most value for the company.<br>
Exploitation will be a greater focus in 2018, and Slide 10 is an overview of the portfolio. What I'd like you to take away from this line is the breadth<br>of the portfolio, underscored by the number of opportunities shown as blue circles on the chart on the right. The scale of the portfolio is significant,<br>at 120 million BOE on an unrisked basis and 50 million BOE on a risk basis, and we're adding to that portfolio every day as our teams continue to<br>identify new opportunities across our 600,000 net acre leasehold.<br>
The next 3 slides will take you through specific near-term exploitation targets. I won't go into deep detail, but I'd like to give you a flavor for the<br>types of opportunities we're currently working.<br>
I mentioned our Mission Canyon success earlier, and I couldn't be more pleased with our first exploitation well here. It was well executed, maintained<br>in a tight horizontal target window and the production results were strong, with an initial 30-day average rate of 1,050 barrels of oil per day. It was<br>completed open hole with no stimulation for a total drill and complete cost at $3.6 million.<br>
We have running room with this horizon at CCA and currently think that we have around 24 additional locations. We have a rig drilling the first<br>well on a 2-well pad right now and have a total of 6 Mission Canyon wells planned for 2018.<br>
On the Gulf Coast at Kingsley, we plan to drill a well in the Parise Sand starting around the end of the first quarter. This well targets an unswept<br>lower perm area of Tinsley, with individual well costs between $3 million or $4 million and good running room for an additional development.<br>
Back up in the Powder River Basin, unconventional development of the Turner, Parkman and Niobrara and Mowry has steadily moved closer to<br>our Hartzog Draw unit where we hold deep rights to around 13,000 net acres. We're planning to drill a well here in the second half of the year to<br>test the prospectivity on our acreage, which is held by Hartzog Draw Unit production and has significant existing infrastructure.<br>
One of our key focus areas for the year is improving our financial strength, and we are taking a deep look at how each of our assets fits in the<br>portfolio. Last year, we disclosed our intent to sell some Houston area acreage, and this process is progressing well. We expect to begin to see big<br>results in the second quarter, with partial sales expected to continue throughout 2018.<br>
Separately, we've been taking a hard look at our asset base and the potential for portfolio management opportunities in 2018. I believe it's important<br>to continually evaluate our assets along their life cycles to determine where best to deploy capital and when to divest of certain assets to upgrade<br>the asset base. With this in mind, we've identified several of our mature oil fields in the Gulf Coast region that we plan to market for sale in the near<br>future. The fields being marketed are those listed in the Mature Area on Slide 8 in the presentation.<br>
And before I hand it over to Mark, I want to emphasize how pleased I am with the performance of our employees. Their grit, creativity and hard<br>work drove our successes in 2017 and will take us to the next level in 2018.<br>

<A name=117></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, DNR - Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Mark C. Allen</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary<br>
Thank you, Chris, and good morning. My comments today will highlight some of the financial items in our release, primary focusing on the sequential<br>changes from the third quarter, and I will also provide some forward-looking guidance to help you in updating your financial models.<br>
Starting on Slide 15. We are extremely pleased with our financial results this quarter as our continued efforts on cost reductions, efficiency and<br>execution are starting to shine through.<br>
On an adjusted basis, net income was $48 million for the fourth quarter, up from $14 million in the third quarter, with the increase mostly driven<br>by higher revenues. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $127 million, with the primary differences being a $78 million adjustment for<br>noncash mark-to-market commodity derivative changes and a one-time deferred tax benefit of $132 million, reflecting the re-measurement of<br>deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%.<br>
Turning to Slide 16. Our non-GAAP adjusted cash flow from operations, which excludes working capital changes improved to $134 million for the<br>fourth quarter, nearly doubling from the third quarter, again, driven primarily by higher revenues.<br>
Our fourth quarter average realized oil price before hedges were $57 per barrel, a 20% increase from our realized price in the prior quarter. When<br>you include the impact of our hedges, the per barrel realized oil price increased 16% from the prior quarter as our combined revenues and commodity<br>derivative settlements increased by $46 million.<br>
Slide 17 provides a summary of our oil price differentials, which is our average realized oil prices relative to NYMEX prices. Our oil price differential<br>improved by over $2 per barrel from last quarter, which on its own equates to an $11 million uplift in revenues.<br>
Our overall differential of a $1.70 above NYMEX prices is the best differential we have realized since the second quarter of 2013. This improvement<br>was generally related to an expanding premium for light Louisiana sweet oil, which averaged over $5 per barrel above NYMEX prices in Q4, tracking<br>similarly to the increase in Brent prices. Approximately 2/3 of our production has an LLS index component included in its price formula. We have<br>also seen our CCA and Rockies price differential improve to the best levels since we began operations there in 2010.<br>
On the bottom portion of this slide, you can see the movement in the LS premium over the last few years and the LS future's basis differentials for<br>the remainder of 2018. As you can see, the LS premium has pulled back significantly from recent highs and is trending in the positive $2 to $2.50<br>range.<br>
I'll review our hedging positions on our next slide but as I had mentioned on last quarter's call, we previously took advantage of the opportunities<br>to lock in LLS to WTI basis swaps at an average premium above $4 per barrel to the first half of 2018 to capture a portion of this strong premium.<br>
With the LS premium trending down throughout 2018, we expect that our overall oil differential, excluding hedges, will also trend lower. Currently,<br>we anticipate that our overall differential for the first quarter of 2018 will be in the positive $0.75 to $1 range, and for the second to fourth quarters,<br>we are currently anticipating our oil differential to be in a range of flat with NYMEX to a positive $0.50.<br>
Slide 18 provides a summary of our oil price hedges. Since our last quarter's conference call, we added 2018 hedges covering 10,000 barrels per<br>day of NYMEX and LLS-fixed price swaps. Our hedges now represent approximately 65% to 70% of our currently anticipated 2018 production levels.<br>For 2019, we have begun to layer in a combination of fixed-price swaps and three-way collars. Our initial hedging objectives for 2019 [will] protect<br>$55 and provide upside exposure to the mid-60s with collars and protect close to $60 with swaps. We plan to continue to add to our 2019 hedges<br>over the course of the year depending on market conditions.<br>
Moving to the next slide. I'd like to review some of our expense line items, starting the G&amp;A. Our G&amp;A expense was $21 million for Q4, 25% lower<br>than the third quarter and the lowest quarterly level in 9 years.<br>
In the lower right-hand portion of this slide, you can see our G&amp;A per BOE, which was $3.64 per BOE in Q4, the lowest level we have had in quite<br>some time. Our G&amp;A is now beginning to reflect the significant cost reductions implemented in the third quarter. Our net G&amp;A related to stock-based<br>

<hr>
<A name=118></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, DNR - Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call<br>
compensation was approximately $3 million this quarter, and we currently expect our G&amp;A for 2018 to remain in the lower $20 million range per<br>quarter, with stock-based compensation representing roughly $3 million to $5 million of that amount.<br>
Net interest expense was $23 million this quarter, a slight increase from last quarter due to the additional interest treated as debt resulting from<br>our most recent debt exchange transactions. On the bottom portion of this slide, you will see there is a more detailed breakout of the components<br>of interest expense. We currently expect our capitalized interest to be in the $7 million to $8 million range per quarter throughout 2018.<br>
Our DD&amp;A expense this quarter was $53 million, a slight increase from the third quarter. We expect our DD&amp;A expense will be in the $53 million<br>to $56 million range throughout 2018.<br>
Our income taxes this quarter were significantly impacted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation enacted in December, which, among other<br>things, lowered the federal income tax rate for corporations from 35% or 21%.<br>
Since we are in a net deferred tax liability position, this reduced the company's future tax liabilities, resulting in a $132 million income tax benefit<br>this quarter.<br>
For 2018, we expect that our effective tax rate will be close to 25%, with little or no cash taxes.<br>
Turning to our 2018 sources and uses on Slide 20. As Chris mentioned, we built our 2018 budget around a $55 oil price, and we plan to keep our<br>spending within cash flow as we have historically done. Note that at the top of our -- on the top our $300 million to $325 million of development<br>capital, we estimate approximately $30 million for capitalized interest, which brings our total CapEx range to $330 million to $355 million.<br>
As shown on the right-hand portion of this slide, we estimate that our 2018 cash flow from operations will be in the $430 million to $480 million<br>range, assuming $55 WTI prices, and also assuming $30 million of interest being capitalized. Due to the accounting for our debt exchanges completed<br>over the last couple of years, roughly $90 million of interest on our debt will be shown in our financial statements as a reduction of debt instead<br>of interest expense. So to give you an accurate reflection of cash available to spend, we have subtracted this amount from our estimated cash flow<br>from operations, bringing our cash flow to an adjusted range of $340 million to $390 million, and giving us excess net cash flow of $10 million to<br>$35 million.<br>
One other thing I'd like to point out on this slide is the sensitivity of cash flow to oil prices. Excluding hedges, a $5 change in oil price would impact<br>our cash flow by around $100 million. Considering our 2018 hedge positions, if prices average $50 for the year, we would only expect a cash flow<br>reduction of $50 million. And if prices average $60 for the year, we would expect a gain of $30 million in cash flow.<br>
Moving to our balance sheet. Pro forma for the debt exchange transaction completed in early January, we have total debt principal of approximately<br>$2.7 billion as of December 31, 2017. We had $475 million outstanding in our bank credit facility and over $500 million of remaining borrowing<br>base availability.<br>
Since the oil price downturn that began in 2014, we have reduced our debt principal by $836 million. The earliest maturity of our debt is our bank<br>facility, which matures in December 2019, and we have started initial conversations with our lead bank regarding the extension of this facility in<br>2018. Our main priority will be to retain ample liquidity and full access to our billion fifty borrowing base. We believe that our value sustaining asset<br>base and improving debt metrics gives Denbury a much different debt profile than what is reflected in our trailing 12-month leverage metrics.<br>
Although our trailing 12-month debt-to-EBITDA ratio is in the 6.5x range, we see this improving meaningfully throughout 2018 and 2019, assuming<br>oil prices remain in a $55 to $60 price range. We also see a path for Denbury to approach 3.5x total leverage given a $60 oil price environment over<br>the next couple of years and with our existing asset base.<br>
Based on our current projections, we expect our outstanding bank debt to come down throughout the year to the $300 million to $400 million<br>range, largely due to anticipated proceeds from our Houston area land sales.<br>

And now I'll turn it back to John for some closing comments.<br>
<b>John Mayer</b><br>
Thank you, Mark. That concludes our prepared remarks. Brad, can you please open the call up for questions?<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Tim Rezvan with Mizuho.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
I got a few here. I guess I'll start. The Cedar Creek Anticline EOR decision. Chris, you've repeatedly put out a first half '18 event. And then the slide<br>deck has language saying that the company's looking to establish a path forward. Given that we're at the end of February here, the first half is only<br>4 more months, can you give any color on kind of where you stand or what you're pursuing? Or how that possibly could look getting to FID there?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Tim. So the way back I think about these, first of all, it's just such a great target upwards of 300 million barrels of potentially EOR resource up there,<br>which is well in excess of our total current proved reserve base. So it's something that you really want to chase after. And what we're doing, even<br>through the downturn, we've kept the permitting process, which is really the main time impact on the whole project. We've kept that running<br>through the downturn. And I think, what I see us heading towards is a confluence of getting the permitting resolved to a point where we can<br>proceed, and we're feeling pretty good about that in the first part of this year. Getting the technical work and getting that piece of done, and that's<br>every bit of that that I've seen as we've come through the last couple of quarters, is starting to come to a head. Again, with this objective of getting<br>that landed in the first half of this year. And then, the project work and taking into account some of the learnings that we've picked up over the<br>last few years and reducing -- optimizing the cost of our facilities and making a fit for purpose-type of development on the facility side. That's all<br>coming together, very focused on getting that decided the first half of this year. And then what I see is that would put us in a position to have the<br>pipe, which is a major single investment late in 2019, get injection started in '20 and then see first production in '21. So that's the framework that<br>we're seeing there, Tim. And I think that, at least everything I've seen so far, is very positive.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
Okay. Okay. So are you -- are there plans that you might -- that you may go ahead without really looking for a partner, some kind of third-party<br>capital infusion on the project?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
No. One piece that I didn't mention in my description there is that we're looking at how we fund that and some different options there. Honestly,<br>we'd prefer not to take the chunky capital of the pipeline in 1 year. We have a lot of other very nice projects we'd like to do with that. And so part<br>of the process we're working through the same time is exactly that, is looking at different paths for bringing in some outside capital for doing that.<br>And as you mentioned, that is a great type of business that, I think, people are interested in investing in. And so that's something that will happen<br>along the same time and to some degree, perhaps, even beyond the first half of the year, but I don't see any risk associated with that.<br>

<A name=120></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, DNR - Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
Okay. I appreciate all the color. And then, perhaps, this is a related topic. You talked about marketing some of your mature assets. It looks like<br>production a little over 7,000 a day on that. Was that a separate decision from possible funding CCA? Or others kind of -- do you see those as<br>integrated decisions?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
I see them as separate decisions, Tim. That really -- looking at our portfolio is something that we should be doing every quarter, every year, and<br>making sure that our portfolio makes the most sense for our priorities and where we want to deploy our capital and, honestly, just our focus. So<br>they are separate, but I do see that at the end of the day, we're -- there's going to be a question of proceeds from that sale, what are you going to<br>do with those? And we're very open with where that'd be deployed, whether it's into reducing debt, into the assets and something like CCA or<br>doing something else with it. But that is a possibility, but they were arrived at separately really just makes sense for us to look at these assets and<br>get our portfolio as optimized as we can.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
Okay. Okay. If I could switch, and this may be a better question for Mark. The 4Q '17, the unit expense profile was very strong. But if -- I can understand<br>it from the prepared comments, you expect LOE to up to about $0.50. Should we think about that as $0.50 from the full year 2017 average, which<br>gets us closer to kind of a 21 level? Or is that from the 4Q '17 kind of level?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
I think of it, Tim -- this Chris again, from the full year average. We see it landing around there. Obviously, there's a lot to be gained from continued<br>focus at the field level on what we can do to improve that, and we're continuing to work other paths to improving it. Honestly, optimizing our<br>portfolio will do that to some degree, growing our production will do it to another back. But to frame that, I think, you're right looking at the full<br>year.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
Okay. Okay. And then, I guess, just one final one. It sounds like the Houston real estate sale it may not be one package but it could be multiple<br>packages. So is that something that we should maybe just we'll get in like little pieces throughout 2018? Is that how should we think about that?<br>
<b>Mark C. Allen</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary<br>
So what -- the way we think about the real estate sale in Houston, Tim, is 2 distinct parts. First, the area in Conroe there that's near The Woodlands,<br>south of the town of Conroe. And that is one main parcel or one main piece of real estate that's broken up into 7 parcels. And all of those parcels<br>are going out for an RFP on March 1 of this year. So just a couple of weeks from now. And we expect to have bids in that by the end of March and<br>see some notional -- we expect to get some purchase and sale agreements executed in the second quarter. So that's something that, I think, you'd<br>see something from us in the second quarter. Then as we move south to Webster, that this multiple different parcels. Just the nature of their real<br>estate there along the frontage road, on I-45 going down to Galveston, there are many different nice things we can do with the -- with that property<br>and that will be something that I think you'll see starting to come in over the course of '18, and might even be beyond that. But there's a lot of<br>interest, a lot of good things happening there. Kind of 2 different things. A big piece in Conroe that we'll see some numbers on in the second quarter<br>and then the rest of it in Webster that will happen throughout the year here.<br>

<A name=121></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, DNR - Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we do have a question from the line of Tarek Hamid from JPMorgan.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
This is actually Kevin Quan calling in for Tarek. Just on Mission Canyon, I understand that it's slightly in early stages, but I just wanted to gauge<br>expectations and sort of any change in geology for your 2 additional wells kind of to the North and South of your initial pilot well there and any<br>other detail would be helpful.<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
So Kevin, what we'd say about Mission Canyon. First of all, it's early days. So we have 1 well that's been producing for really less than 2 months now.<br>Certainly, we're pleased with what we've seen. We want to get more time with the well that we've drilled. We want to get more wells drilled and<br>get some production history behind there. If you look at the map that we've provided for the Mission Canyon area that we're drilling right now, as<br>I mentioned, we've already spudded the second well on that same structure. And we really don't see anything different that we expect in the next<br>2 wells in terms of where we are geologically and what we're looking for. It's more of just testing the same concept and the same accumulation<br>and establishing some production history. As we move outside of the Pennel and Coral Creek area, which is one of these first wells will be, then<br>there're some different ideas that we're going to be testing, but again, all of it is generally the same concept with this fairly narrow interval of<br>Mission Canyon. It's very productive, and we have some good running room across the CCA area with it.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Okay. That's quite helpful. And I assume that a lot of the other -- the remaining -- the total 24 locations that you have, that's for the remaining sort<br>of (inaudible) Creek area and [Little Beaver] and the other regions or are they...<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Exactly. Kevin, if you across the inset map we have there, we have the initial wells in the Pennel, Coral area and then we have those red ovals<br>highlighting some other opportunities that we see in our leaseholds that are outside of those fields.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Okay. Got it. And on Slide 17 you kind of -- I'm just hopping back to your capital plan. I just wanted to see the cadence of your capital projects<br>throughout the year. I know you list quite a few tertiary and non-tertiary ones there. I'm just trying to see how lumpy it might be towards the end<br>of the year, et cetera?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
I -- just off the top of my head. I don't think that there's any particular jump or drop in capital as we go through the course of the year. The exploitation<br>piece is working now and will continue. The Bell Creek Phase 6 piece is working now and will continue throughout the year. So I see it being fairly<br>flat as we move across the year.<br>

<A name=122></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, DNR - Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Okay, that's fair. And then, along those same lines, the mature areas -- fields that you mentioned that you're looking at marketing. Just wanted to<br>get any detail on those particular assets in the sense of what interest look like. I know, again, it's probably early days as well, but just trying to get<br>a gauge on how soon that might happen.<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
So that's something that -- we don't want to share too much of our thinking around that. We can share why we're making this move but our<br>expectations, and so on, we want to let the process work. But it is something that we expect to kick off fairly soon here, and we'll see a -- we'll see<br>that out in the public within the next few days actually looking to close it by the end of the second quarter.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Okay. That's helpful. My last one too, quickly on your revolver. I just wanted to see what your expectations on potential refinancing might be, given<br>your improvement in reserve base?<br>
<b>Mark C. Allen</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary<br>
Yes. This is Mark. Yes. As I mentioned, we're starting to work with our lead bank, JPMorgan, and the bank group in terms of extending that out. We<br>think there's numerous possibilities and, I think, the one thing that really -- and I said before, that differentiates us is just our assets and they're<br>sustaining value. Yes our leverage metrics have been higher than we would like and we're starting to see those move here in the right direction.<br>With cost reductions and prices, which is, I think one very positive sign and I think over the last few years, our bank group has continued to work<br>with us quite well and we just -- we're confident in how we're going to move forward here.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we do have a question from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.<br>
<b>Charles Arthur Meade</b> - Johnson Rice &amp; Company, L.L.C., Research Division - Analyst<br>
Sorry for asking again about these Mission Canyon wells, but, I guess, when you make 1,000 barrel a day well for whatever, $3.6 million, people<br>want to know more about it. I'm curious if you can talk about what the, what kind of decline profile you're seeing and you expect to see in this well?<br>When I just look at your current EOR and the rate, the way those 2 fit together make it seem like it's a pretty high decline well. But I wanted to just<br>test that because we've gotten to the point -- we've answered the question about or maybe addressed the question of how repeatable that is, but<br>also how good is this? So can you talk about how -- what you're seeing in 2 months of decline on this?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
You bet. So what I'd say, Charles, is that first of all, that the EOR that you had seen that we disclosed publically was a predrill expectation so there's<br>going to be some adjustment to that as we go. I would still say it's early days on how this behaves. But if you think about just the nature of putting<br>a long lateral in a pretty thin reservoir, we'd expect it to behave, honestly, more like an unconventional well where you have some fairly high initial<br>decline rates. We're going to keep watching that. We're not to the point where we have enough of a track record out here with it to really talk in<br>too much detail. But what I would say, look at it to be along the lines of what you'd expect more in the unconventional side with the benefit of<br>these wells being that we are completing open hole without of frac and the cost associated with that.<br>

<A name=123></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, DNR - Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Charles Arthur Meade</b> - Johnson Rice &amp; Company, L.L.C., Research Division - Analyst<br>
That's helpful insight, Chris. Thank you. If I could ask also about -- if you could talk a bit more about the exploitation you're doing at Tinsley and<br>this Parise Sand. Did I hear you right that is one of the traditional field pays that's maybe under CO2 flood in different parts of the field? And are<br>you guys planning on going at this with a being frac? Or what's your plan of attack?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes. So what's interesting about that and it's even -- it even applies back to the Mission Canyon, Charles, is that these -- certain of these reservoirs,<br>when we produce them on primary, when that's complete, they set themselves up very nicely for CO2. And that's the case with Mission Canyon,<br>and that'll be the same for Perry. With the Perry, it's an area of the Tinsley Field that we don't have perm for traditional vertical wells to really do a<br>great job of sweeping with EOR so we have a lot of residual oil left in that horizon. And that's why we're going to attack this one with the horizontals<br>again. We are going to have to put a bit of a frac in these, we think, to get the rates that we want. So it'll be a little different, although just if you<br>kind of balance the whole nature of the -- of that field and the depth of the reservoir, our well costs are going to be in the same ballpark as what<br>you saw with Mission Canyon.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we do have a question from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities.<br>
<b>Richard Merlin Tullis</b> - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production<br>
Just a couple of questions here, Chris. Going back to the potential sale of the mature properties. It sounds like if you're expecting possibly to have<br>some news in the second quarter, things, I guess, are moving along. Is this more of a package to one party? Or would you expect to break it up?<br>Have you received inbound interest on this that kind of started things off?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
There is definitely some interest in it, Richard. When we look at how the package is set up, it's actually in 2 separate packages that are more<br>geographically aligned. We think there's interest, but it's something that I don't see going to 9 different sellers but we would like to keep it in those<br>2 packages. But like with all of these processes, you had kind of need to see what the interest is and how that shapes up.<br>
<b>Richard Merlin Tullis</b> - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production<br>
Not that you're borrowing much against your borrowing base, but what would the expected impact be to the base and to reserves if you were to<br>sell the whole package with the associated roughly 7,000 barrels a day?<br>
<b>Mark C. Allen</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary<br>
Yes, Richard, it's Mark. Yes, we'll need to work through that with the banks. It could be at a level that we'll need to get their permission, but it's kind<br>of marginal at that point so...<br>
<b>Richard Merlin Tullis</b> - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production<br>
Okay. Okay. And Mark, I know you also talked about potentially moving the leverage ratio down into the 3.5x level over a period of years. What<br>levers do you have to pull at this point beyond, say, oil price-related, what's up next?<br>

<A name=124></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, DNR - Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Mark C. Allen</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary<br>
Yes. Well, I think we've done a lot of things over the last couple of years. Obviously, we've hit on cost reductions. We've done some exchanges,<br>utilizing our capital structure and the flexibility that it has provided. I think we still have some flexibility remaining there. We have some new<br>instruments in the last exchanges in the form of converts, which could provide some optionality, and we'd like to see those convert here at some<br>point. But we still think what really drives our ability forward here is obviously, we're doing a lot of great things on our operations side, we have<br>some new projects, but more than that is really just getting back to the sustaining nature of our reserves and the fact that our reserve basis is very<br>desirable, it doesn't deplete rapidly over time. And so when people look at that from an investment standpoint, they appreciate that, and it has a<br>totally different profile. So all those things combined, I'd say, still give us a lot of flexibility and ways to think about continuing to improve our<br>balance sheet over time, Richard.<br>
<b>Richard Merlin Tullis</b> - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production<br>
That's helpful. And just lastly for me. Did you provide a range of expected proceeds for Houston land sale? Or maybe asked another way, have you<br>had an appraisal done on the properties? Or that you could share with us?<br>
<b>Mark C. Allen</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary<br>
When we rolled this out, Richard, last year, we talked about it covering off basically our Salt Creek acquisition, which is in the low $70 million range.<br>And I would say since that point in time, we obviously continued to expand our thinking and yes, we're working with brokers who are marketing<br>this and have some values in mind. And so we're very cautious to get into much beyond what we've said, but we've continued to become more<br>encouraged over time and determine what could that be.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) It looks like we have a follow-up question from the line of Tim Rezvan with Mizuho.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
Just a couple of quick follow-ups from me. Can you disclose what the P&amp;A liabilities would be on this mature asset?<br>
<b>Mark C. Allen</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary<br>
Yes. At this point, I don't think we want to get into too much of the specifics around that. If we -- as we go forward, and we get to talk about the<br>potential sale or the -- get bids and stuff, then we'll give more clarity around that.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
Okay. It was worth a shot, I guess. And then, a second. You've talked a lot about Bell Creek Phase 5 expansion and Phase 6 coming in this year. From<br>a modeling point of view, how should we think about kind of where -- at what level and kind of when we could see sort of production peak from<br>that field? I mean, how do -- what assumptions do you all have for 2018 baked in, kind of the corporate production guidance?<br>

<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Tim, I'll take that. The first thing I'd say about Bell Creek, and you might have noticed it on our production table, is that without contribution from<br>Phase 5, we still reached a new EOR record in the fourth quarter there, and our teams have just done a superb job of working through the -- Phases<br>1 through 4 with -- and optimizing our production there. Did some creative nice work to continue to grow production from the initial phases. Then<br>Phase 5, we expect to start to see the response. We actually have it completed, as I mentioned, and we're injecting, and we have the initial response,<br>which is, essentially, water production that's very strong. It looks good to us. We're optimistic about how it's going to respond with oil. We expect<br>to see that midyear. Not really ready to talk about the volumes that we expect, but I think that what you've seen in our overall guide represents<br>probably a conservative view of what we think about that. And then, of course, Phase 6, we're following right beyond Phase 5 so that will be<br>executed through the course of this year with response expected in 2019. So I think our peak on Bell Creek is still a few years away, Tim.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
So 2019 will be the year we could see the potential step change increase?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes. I think you'll see a step change that will begin in 2018 with the Phase 5 response and that will continue on with the Phase 6 in '19.<br>

<b>E. New Business Wins &amp; Backlog:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Had record $7b in new business wins.<br><b>2. </b>Backlog stood at $19.4b at 2017-end.<br>
<b>a. </b>18% growth YoverY.<br>
<b>3. </b>$7b in new business was up 30% from $5.4b in 2016.<br>
<b>a. </b>Main drivers were the outstanding performance in all-digital instrument clusters and audio/infotainment.<br>
<b>4. </b>One of Co.'s goals is to increase the avg. size of new business win, which ultimately drives improved profitability.<br>
<b>a. </b>In 2017, increased the avg. size of a new award by approx. 25%.<br>
<b>5. </b>Performance was very well distributed from a regional viewpoint.<br>
<b>a. </b>All regions were well represented.<br><b>b. </b>Pleased with improvement in North America, which grew 70% YoverY in terms of new business wins.<br>

<A name=131></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, VC - Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>6. </b>As a result of strong performance in 2017, backlog at year-end was up 18% YoverY, reaching $19.4b at year-end.<br>
<b>a. </b>A significant portion of the backlog is made up of products that are growing faster than the market and is also oriented<br>
more towards regions that are growing faster in terms of vehicle production and sales.<br>
<b>F. Key Technology Trends:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>In addition to delivering on financial commitments, VC is also focused on ensuring the continued success of Co. as the<br>
industry goes through its transformation.<br>
<b>2. </b>Cockpit electronics segment is going through a significant transformation.<br><b>3. </b>Many of the trends such as digitalization of the cockpit, connected car and ECU consolidation are already well underway.<br>
<b>a. </b>VC has done well in taking advantage of these trends in the past couple of years.<br><b>b. </b>Strategic actions VC has taken in these areas will continue to position Co. well going forward.<br>
<b>4. </b>Evolution of ADAS towards autonomous driving has been making significant progress.<br>
<b>a. </b>Industry is now looking at offering Level 3 automation with features such as Highway Pilot and remote self-parking.<br>
<b>5. </b>In addition to autonomous driving technology itself, Level 3 automation requires careful transition of the control of the<br>
vehicle between the human driver and the autonomous driving system.<br>
<b>a. </b>This is leading toward convergence between cockpit electronics and autonomous driving technologies.<br><b>b. </b>As a leader in cockpit electronics technologies and with the launch of autonomous driving platform earlier this year, VC<br>
is in a unique position to address these new requirements.<br>
<b>6. </b>Going forward, Co. expects cockpit electronics to require new innovations in human-machine interface to facilitate the<br>
evolution of autonomous driving.<br>
<b>a. </b>These new cockpit solutions, together with emerging Level 3-plus autonomous driving solutions, is offering VC further<br>
opportunity to grow the business.<br>
<b>G. Convergence of Cockpit Electronics &amp; Autonomous Driving:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Last significant change to occur in cockpit electronics human-machine interface was driven by the introduction of infotainment<br>
technology in the cockpit.<br>
<b>a. </b>This required the industry to move beyond hard buttons and knobs to touch screens, speech recognition and haptic<br>
controllers.<br>
<b>2. </b>Now, there is another transformation of the cockpit electronics underway, driven by the emergence of autonomous driving.<br>
<b>a. </b>The changes are driven by the need to keep the driver informed about the state of the external environment even while<br>
the vehicle is being controlled by the system and to hand over the control of the vehicle to the human driver in a timely<br>manner as required.<br>
<b>i. </b>This is driving cockpit capabilities such as virtual reality, digital instrument clusters, driver monitoring solutions and<br>
augmented reality head-up displays.<br>
<b>ii. </b>These innovations are expected to be launched in the market by 2021, coinciding with the broader launch of Level 3<br>
autonomous solutions.<br>
<b>iii. </b>Co. is developing these new capabilities in its cluster and autonomous driving technology platforms.<br>
<b>3. </b>At CES earlier this year, demonstrated next generation cluster solution that integrated driver monitoring capability.<br>
<b>a. </b>Also launched DriveCore, Co.'s autonomous driving platform which provides it with an entry point in the very important<br>
area of technology for automotive for the future.<br>
<b>b. </b>As the industry moves towards autonomous driving, these cockpit electronics and autonomous driving technologies will<br>
become increasingly important in winning future business.<br>
<b>4. </b>Made significant progress in evolving technology platforms to stay current with the market.<br>
<b>H. Summary:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>4Q17:<br>
<b>a. </b>Sales $797m.<br><b>b. </b>Adjusted EBITDA, record $102m.<br>
<b>i. </b>12.8% of sales.<br>
<b>c. </b>12th straight qtr. of YoverY adjusted EBITDA margin growth.<br>
<b>d. </b>Awarded record $2.4b in new business wins.<br>

<A name=134></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, VC - Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.<br>
<b>Ryan J. Brinkman</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
And the question is about the bookings number, was extremely strong in the fourth quarter, to the layman, it would appear that<br>you're well on track to exceed the 2017 and 2018 sort of combined $12 billion number. Is that the way we should look at it? Or does<br>it relate somehow to a different cadence, some wins you thought that might land in the first quarter of '18, and in fact, fell in the<br>fourth quarter of '17? And what does this imply for your sort of, I think, it's [8.7%] sort of organic CAGR through 2021, et cetera? Are<br>you potentially now in a position to be maybe ahead of plan?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Ryan, first of all, yes, we are very happy with our record setting performance in 2017 with respect to new business wins. What I would<br>say with respect to our longer-term revenue target is that, this performance increases our confidence, first of all, in achieving that<br>target with the wins that we've had in 2017 now, I would say, over more than 60% of the 2021 target of $4.7 billion in revenue is<br>already in our backlog or already sourced. So the way we should think of it is that our confidence in delivering our 2021 revenue<br>target is now significantly higher. Having said that, our revenue outlook depends on a few other things, such as vehicle production<br>forecasts as well as currency. So our target for 2018 for new business wins remains the same, roughly about $6 billion. The sales<br>pipeline looks very strong, so we expect to have another strong year. And as we always do, we will update our outlook for 2021 at<br>the end of the year and then provide you with an update at the next Deutsche Bank conference. But overall, again, a very strong<br>year. We feel good about our prospects in the 2020, 2021 timeframe, as we have said earlier in this year as well. And I think it also<br>positions us well in terms of being able to deliver a strong 2018.<br>
<b>Ryan J. Brinkman</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay, great, and then just lastly from me. We saw that earlier announcement that you had won that sort of design win for SmartCore<br>in Europe, and without producing all of the associated hardware. And now today, you've got this announcement of a software-only<br>Phoenix win. Can you kind of talk about the implications of that? Do you prefer to produce the associated hardware also? Or are you<br>more attracted to a software or design approach because of the positive implications to margin and presumably return on invested<br>capital?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. Let me talk first about this win and then I'll also invite Christian to talk about the margin. So if you look at the sales cycle for a<br>typical conquest infotainment win, it's usually more than a year. And so we are very happy to have 2 wins in Phoenix within a year<br>of the launch of the platform. So this second win is for an European OEM, and this is for their existing infotainment systems that they<br>wanted to upgrade to be able to host web apps in a downloadable fashion. So we are providing the Phoenix runtime and the studio<br>developer software to enable the OEM and the third parties to create downloadable apps for this infotainment system. This is a<br>software-only sale, and as such, the business model relies on a royalty that we collect on a per unit basis. And since this is an existing<br>infotainment system, the initial start of production is actually Q3 of this year. So it -- I would say, it's a great validation of our software<br>oriented approach to our platforms. It represents an acceleration of revenue and as a software-only business, the margins are what<br>you'd expect from a software business. Christian, would you like to add something?<br>

<A name=135></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, VC - Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, the only thing I would add, Ryan, is that when you think about the software only, it actually provides us the ability to experiment<br>with various revenue models, which we did not have without having this platform-based technology like Phoenix. It is also interesting<br>to note that the hardware is based on somebody else's as a competitor's hardware. So it actually gives us the ability to port our<br>technology on somebody else's platform, so which is kind of really interesting.<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
And the last thing I would add, Ryan, to your question, whether we would prefer to offer software only or along with the hardware.<br>It really is a choice that we don't get to make in most of those cases. This is the OEM in most cases that decides that. We do expect<br>a few other opportunities in this way where on account of the installed base of infotainment systems that lack the ability to offer an<br>app environment, there is a demand for the kind of software that we offer with Phoenix. But in the vast majority of the cases, we<br>expect that the OEMs will want a complete system hardware along with the software pre-integrated like what we typically would<br>do in normal business.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question is from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Joseph Robert Spak</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst<br>
The first question I had is on free cash flow, actually, and it looks like it was a little lower, I think, driven by higher CapEx, which I<br>believe is related to just more capitalization of software development. And I guess, the question is, as you move more and more<br>towards software-based enterprise, should we think about CapEx running higher than the 3% of sales that it's typically run at? And<br>I guess is there a corresponding offset to R&amp;D?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Joe, this is Christian. So in terms of the CapEx, just to give you the magnitude of the increase that we have, we had about $25 million<br>increase in CapEx year-on-year. But 2/3 are what you would consider normal CapEx, which is the plant equipment and so forth that<br>we needed to support the new program wins that we're having. And 1/3 of that is also -- 1/3 of the increase is the software development<br>costs that you talked about. So going forward, yes, the software development cost is actually helpful in our R&amp;D, but as you recall,<br>when we guided in Deutsche Bank of what happens in 2018, we have -- our engineering expense is expected to increase because<br>of the incremental investments that we have in autonomous driving.<br>
<b>Joseph Robert Spak</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Okay, so there might be some benefit but then there's additional investment in autonomous?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Right, right, but in terms of the guidance, we think 3% is a good number for CapEx as a percent of revenue going forward.<br>

<A name=136></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, VC - Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Joseph Robert Spak</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Okay, and then if we look at Slide 5, where you provided the information on infotainment and the backlog, so it looks like, if you<br>look at sort of the mix shift, right, a big move to sort of display audio, and it looks like that sort of evenly taken in terms of the mix<br>percentage anyway from regular audio and embedded infotainment. And so, I would have thought from an ASP perspective, those<br>2 might actually offset, but you're still saying that ASPs are up 10%. So I guess, within embedded infotainment, are those ASPs higher<br>as well year-over-year?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, so the embedded infotainment ASPs are maintaining their pricing levels. So what is really happening here is that the display<br>audio is significantly higher than the audio that it is replacing, and that is what is helping the average ASP go up by about 10% for<br>us -- for the full amount. The way to think of it is, as you mentioned, we are winning in all of the 3 segments. This is a turnaround<br>year, 2017 was a turnaround year for us in infotainment, and it's really driven on account -- by the fact that we have made some<br>investments in our platforms and then we talked about Phoenix, it scales really well from entry infotainment all the way to mid-high<br>and the strength that we have on account of the acquisition of AllGo in our -- the smartphone projection capabilities, which are very<br>important, not just for display audio segment, but also for embedded.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And your next question is from the line of David Lim with Wells Fargo.<br>
<b>Hyong Lim</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Just a couple questions, when we look at your $7 billion in win, can you parse out how much of that is conquest versus incumbent?<br>And then, your win rate from a conquest perspective? And then I have another follow up.<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
David, this is Christian. In terms of conquest and incumbent, about 70% to 80%, we would consider conquest, right, and the rest<br>would be incumbent.<br>
<b>Hyong Lim</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
And can you give us an idea of your win rates on there? I mean is it more like a 30% or a 40% win rate when you do conquest bids<br>or is it more than that?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
I'm sorry, let me rephrase what I said, I had it reversed. So 30% is conquest and 70% would be incumbent of the $7 billion that we<br>won.<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
And regarding the win rate question, David, so about 80% of the incumbent, we win, so that's roughly our win rate there and when<br>it comes to conquest, our win rate is closer to 50%.<br>

<b>Hyong Lim</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Got you. And then on the Phoenix software side, on the software side, I know that it is a little early but on the royalty, can you give<br>us a little bit more color, I mean, relative to, like units that you anticipate? And are we talking about $10 to $20 per car or is it something<br>higher than that or lower than that? Any kind of additional direction would be very helpful.<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. It really depends on the content. So it's hard to put a specific number. There is a lot of feature content that drives the royalty<br>structure but it's in the range that you just mentioned, it's a -- in this particular case, as we mentioned, there is an existing infotainment<br>system. So this is adding to the capabilities, especially with regard to the ability to download apps from the Internet and run them<br>securely on the infotainment system. As we go forward and there is additional features that Phoenix will deliver, including all of the<br>base infotainment capabilities, then the value of that software would increase. But in this particular case, it's in the range that we<br>have just talked about.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question is from the line of David Leiker with Robert W. Baird &amp; Co.<br>
<b>Joseph D. Vruwink</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Associate<br>
This is Joe Vruwink for David. The all-digital cluster wins seemed notable. I think you've discussed that market growing 25% to 30%.<br>Your new wins are growing 70%. How much of the outgrowth today is barriers to entry that you sort of brought up the complexity<br>of the product kind of boxing out or excluding a lot of legacy cluster suppliers versus technology or cost leadership, you would say<br>Visteon has even against competing companies that do have a digital product but it's just not quite what you're offering?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, so Joe, first thing I would mention here is that one of the key capabilities in our a all-digital cluster, there are 2 in fact, one is the<br>display, the other is the software. And when it comes to the digital display, Visteon has always had a very strong capability in<br>automotive digital displays. We ship over $400 million worth of digital displays every year. So we have a strong capability in taking<br>LCD panels and then treating them and bonding and fabricating the automotive displays that have to withstand the conditions<br>within the car and meet critical requirements. This is not something that most players in the space have, as a vertically integrated<br>capability. So that's one element of that. The other is the software. And then, so what has happened here with software is that besides<br>having the key capabilities in terms of the technology, we, at Visteon, have critical mass in terms of supporting the specific vehicle<br>architectures of a wide number of automakers in the world. So we have now a broad-based platform that we can take to automakers<br>that more than likely supports their requirements out of the box. That's different from, say with many other of our competitors, that<br>reduces the risk to the program, reduces our cost in developing that cluster, and this is one of the main reasons why we have won<br>as much business as we've won. This is the second year that -- in a row that we have won about $3.8 billion, $3.9 billion in clusters<br>and when you look at the market, which is on an annual basis, somewhere around $7 billion, it represents a significant market share.<br>So we do expect, however, that as we go forward, more of the automakers to transition towards all-digital. And again, momentum<br>is a very good thing, and this should put us in a good shape to win more of the business going forward in all-digital clusters.<br>

<b>Joseph D. Vruwink</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Associate<br>
And since you brought up platform. So I remember back when you took the infotainment platform at Harman and that was really<br>the turning point to getting infotainment into the Japanese automakers. Obviously, they value performance but they're also reliability<br>cost sensitive. Do you think Visteon is near a similar milestone where this first win with the Japanese automaker really opens up that<br>industry as a totally incremental opportunity?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. We have, Joe, a few firsts when it comes to all-digital clusters. We had the first 12-inch all-digital cluster win with a Japanese<br>OEM, which is a significant step. I think this is -- this would really enable us to build and demonstrate our capability in Japan, in that<br>market, which is a difficult market for most non-Japanese suppliers to crack into. And it's a significant win, which means that's it's<br>definitely going to put us on the map, which should help us with more business wins in the future.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Deem with Longbow Research.<br>
<b>Anthony J. Deem</b> - Longbow Research LLC - Senior Analyst<br>
Couple questions for me. First, of the $1.5 billion of wins in the Audio/Infotainment in '17, are you able to specify the values for the<br>2 Phoenix wins and the 2 SmartCore wins?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
It was really hard to hear your question. Can you please repeat?<br>
<b>Anthony J. Deem</b> - Longbow Research LLC - Senior Analyst<br>
Yes, I apologize. So I was wondering if you could specify the values for the 2 Phoenix wins and SmartCore wins out of the $1.5 billion<br>of new business wins in Audio/Infotainment this year?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. We don't typically provide specific values of new business wins. These are things that we -- normally would not be allowed to<br>share by our OEM customers, so we try to stay away from that.<br>
<b>Anthony J. Deem</b> - Longbow Research LLC - Senior Analyst<br>
Okay, I understand. And then just my last question. The shift to all-digital clusters really hit its stride in 2017. And I'm just wondering,<br>since all the digital clusters require more computing resources and it seems the interaction between the cluster and infotainment<br>is a trend. Can you talk to the potential for additional SmartCore new business wins in 2018 beyond? And really it's just -- has the<br>bid presence dramatically increased? Or do you see this more as an opportunity of a gradual increase in wins because of the long<br>leave cycle and transitioning to a single ECU?<br>

<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. So you are absolutely right that this move towards all-digital clusters really drives demand for increased computing resources,<br>including processors, memory and software. And the need is really driven by the sort of the drive towards rendering digital content<br>in the clusters and information that comes typically from an infotainment system. As we see more of these types of solutions, that<br>is also a big sort of a driver behind the integration of infotainment and the cluster because it's a lot more effective to have those 2<br>systems run off of a single electronic control unit or ECU to be able to share that information seamlessly between the 2 displays.<br>Now as we have, I think, in my prepared script mentioned that the momentum in cockpit domain controllers is also picking up, and<br>the pipeline of new opportunities for 2018 is very robust. In fact, it has never been greater. So we are very optimistic about having<br>more success with SmartCore that integrates infotainment and cluster on the single ECU as we go forward here in 2018 and beyond.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question is from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.<br>
<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Just looking through your pricing for the full year and kind of back into the fourth quarter, it looks like it was running about negative<br>3.5% maybe for the quarter. I think it's a little bit worse than what we saw in the third quarter. Are those concessions concentrated<br>with any particular product lines or geographies? And what type of run rates should we be thinking about going forward?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, so David, this is Christian, let me take that one. Pricing, as you know, David, is an interesting dynamic in the auto industry. The<br>impact of pricing in any quarter is dependent on the negotiations that we have, with individual OEMs and the programs that they<br>relate to. So as such, there could be a lot of unevenness between quarters. Now having said that, if you look at the entire year, the<br>impact was $86 million or a little bit above 2.5% of revenues, which is in line with our historical rate. So I think we should just look<br>at that in that fashion.<br>
<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Okay, so no incremental pressure to be thinking about. Sachin, obviously, you guys launched DriveCore at CES so far, you signed up<br>one manufacturer. What have you seen so far from an interest level? And how do we go about monetizing this platform over the<br>next couple of years?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, David, very good question. And then let me try to describe to you the way we see the opportunities in autonomous. So if you<br>look at the industry and some of the things that you're hearing in media, there are really 2 sort of directions that the industry is<br>taking. On one side, there is this push towards fully autonomous, perhaps in more limited domains intended for application such as<br>robot access and for freight movers in trucks that have a point-to-point limited by sort of a specific geofenced area. So that's one<br>initiative. The other initiative is targeted more towards consumer car owners. And in this area, the goal is to upgrade the current<br>Level 1, Level 2 ADAS capabilities into Level 3, more automated driving. So at Visteon, we are really focused on working with our<br>traditional long-term customers in enabling and upgrading Level 1, Level 2 into Level 3. Now the key features there that we expect<br>to be of initial interest would be highway pilot and remote self-parking. So what we are doing now is we're very focused on developing<br>a very cost-effective solution based on DriveCore that meets the requirements of highway pilot and self-driving. And so this is where<br>we would expect as we go -- as we make more progress in releasing these capabilities and launching these features, we'd expect to<br>

see more business opportunities with OEMs that we have started engagement in. The interest is extremely high. We are just as<br>cautious in terms of who we work with and who are the right partners for us as much as anything. Because again, there's a lot of<br>activity in this industry in this regard, at the same time, resources are limited. So we are carefully sorting through the opportunities<br>and making sure that we are partnering with the right set of OEMs. And we'll update you as we go along but so far, we have talked<br>publicly about GAC and we are in discussions with a few others in parallel at the same time.<br>
<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just lastly, as we switch over to software-only Phoenix infotainment win. Can't recall if you<br>noted this already, it was incumbent on someone else's hardware, is that on a display audio or an embedded infotainment platform?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
No, no, it was an embedded infotainment system. It was provided by another supplier to them. And what we have effectively done<br>here is to give them a platform that allows them to support downloadable apps, and that is really where we see the industry head<br>for embedded infotainment and Phoenix is one option for them to be able to get to that solution fairly quickly.<br>
<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
That's fair. How many developers do you have live on that Phoenix Studio platform today?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I would say...<br>
<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
I would imagine that is the selling point, right?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, yes, I would say that our infotainment development team, because we have it all under one global team, I would say that's<br>probably on the order of a couple of hundred developers at this point in time.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And your next question is from Colin Langan with UBS Securities.<br>
<b>Colin Langan</b> - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director in the General Industrials Group and Analyst<br>
Just looking at margins. I think you've talked about getting to 14% over time. Guidance for this year is relatively flat. I mean, what<br>are the drivers? Is it really now at this point depending on the inflection in the sales backlog? Or do you still see more cost opportunities?<br>I know in the past, you've talked about your kind of higher than average on SG&amp;A. Are you now in line? Or what's the opportunity<br>left for margin?<br>

<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Right, so Colin, this is Christian. If you think about the opportunities between where we are right now, a little short of 12%, 11.8% to<br>the 14%, they're really 3 buckets. One is cost efficiency such as you've pointed out, the other one is shift to software platform-based<br>offerings that has accretive pressure on our margins, and the third is fixed cost leverage as we get bigger at a higher revenue base.<br>If you think about the margin progression, from where we are to the 14% target that we've communicated, the fixed cost leverage<br>will happen towards the back end of that as we get -- as we translate or generate the revenues from our backlog. And so that would<br>come in later. The other one is the shift to lower software and platform-based offerings. It's still quite nascent. And as such, the<br>improvement in margins for the first few years before that 5-year plan of 2021 will be coming from cost efficiencies.<br>
<b>Colin Langan</b> - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director in the General Industrials Group and Analyst<br>
Okay. I mean, so do you still see a pretty meaningful cost opportunity at this point?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, yes, when you think about the incremental margins that we are looking at between the 11.8% to 14%, it's the incremental<br>margins around less than 20%, right? So as such we still believe that there's cost efficiencies that could -- that we could generate<br>from our current fixed cost structure.<br>
<b>Colin Langan</b> - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director in the General Industrials Group and Analyst<br>
And are you still above average on SG&amp;A relative to your benchmark peers or do you think that part of the equation (inaudible)?<br>
<b>Christian A. Garcia</b> - Visteon Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Right. So if you think about what happened this year for SG&amp;A, we had a modest increase in revenues. However, SG&amp;A was flat, right?<br>So that means, we continue to see leverage on top of that. So we believe that we can continue to, even if it in a flattish revenue,<br>flattish SG&amp;A cost level. As we increase our revenues, then our SG&amp;A as a percent of sales would actually come down.<br>
<b>Colin Langan</b> - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director in the General Industrials Group and Analyst<br>
Got it. And just lastly, how should we think about the cadence wins for SmartCore, Phoenix and then DriveCore? I mean it seems like<br>SmartCore, I think, it had 2 this year, 2 the prior year, Phoenix 2 this year? Should we -- should I start to accelerate or is this just sort<br>of steady as you go?<br>
<b>Sachin S. Lawande</b> - Visteon Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, Colin, this is Sachin. So yes, as I said, that the cycle of, the sale cycle I should say for infotainment is usually more than a year. So<br>now, you would expect that we would start to see a pickup in activity with respect to infotainment new business activity and new<br>business wins. The same for SmartCore. SmartCore has seen a sort of continuous increase in momentum with automakers and the<br>pipeline in both infotainment and SmartCore looks pretty strong. So I would expect that we would see a pickup in new business<br>activity for those 2 products. With respect to DriveCore, again, it's relatively new for us and for the industry. So there's a lot of<br>discussions that need to happen and business models that need to evolve. So I would say that, that is still in a prebusiness-development<br>phase. I would expect more sort of a pick up to offer perhaps later in the year or early next.<br>

Please be advised that during the course of our presentation,<br>in our question-and-answer session today, we may make forward-looking statements that reflect management's expectations for the future, which<br>are based on current information. Actual results may differ materially from those expectations based on risks to business. The Safe Harbor statement<br>in yesterday's news release and the cautionary statement in the company's most recent Form 10-K are considered a part of this conference call.<br>Material risk factors as well as information relating to company operations are detailed in our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and other public documents<br>filed with the SEC. These documents are available on the Investors section of our website at www.jackinthebox.com.<br>
A few calendar items to note. Jack in the Box management plans to attend at the UBS Global Consumer and Retail Conference in Boston on March<br>8, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Consumer and Retail Technology Conference in New York on March 14, and the Telsey Advisory Group's Spring<br>Consumer Conference in New York on March 21. Our second quarter ends on April 15, and we tentatively plan to announce results on Wednesday,<br>May 16, after market close. Our conference call is tentatively scheduled to be held at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time, on Thursday, May 17.<br>
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lenny.<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
Thank you, Carol, and good morning. We're continuing to work with Apollo on completing the sale of Qdoba, which we're expecting will occur by<br>April, though we will not be discussing that brand's performance during our comments this morning. As for Jack in the Box, our financial performance<br>in the first quarter was solid overall and in line with our expectations. System same-store sales decreased slightly in Q1 as we rolled over a 3.1%<br>increase last year, which was our best quarter of fiscal 2017. But we saw a sequential improvement in both sales and traffic in Q1, and importantly,<br>company restaurant margins remained strong as a result of our refranchising efforts, which offset both commodity and wage inflation. In addition,<br>G&amp;A continued to decline as we focus on becoming a more nimble organization.<br>
This morning, I'd like to talk about some of the restaurant initiatives underway to drive traffic and sales, and to update you on some leadership<br>changes at our company, as well as how I see the flattening of our organizational structure impacting G&amp;A. When it comes to service improvements,<br>whether we're enhancing our restaurant facilities or developing digital solutions, it's imperative that we meet our guest's evolving expectations.<br>Within our restaurants, we believe there are ways to find efficiencies to ensure that our 4 walls economics makes sense for our franchisees over<br>the long term. Though we'll be working with them to accelerate the testing of several pieces of new equipment and processes.<br>
As for digital, we know that if it adds complexity to our operations, we've made a mistake. The app we've been successfully testing does exactly<br>what consumers want today. They can easily view our menu, order, schedule pickup and pay. We also want to be able to easily integrate other<br>features with the app when appropriate, such as delivery. We're heading in the right direction with our app, and we believe we'll be in a position<br>to roll it out systemwide by the end of the year.<br>
Next, innovation. In the past, you've seen us focus most of our menu innovation around premium products, like the ribeye burger, which helped<br>drive sales in Q1, or the food truck sandwiches that Martha Stewart helped us launch during this month's Super Bowl. What you'll see going forward,<br>is that we're going to continue to innovate our own premium products, but also value-based products. The $2 breakfast pockets that we promoted<br>in Q1 as a secondary value message are a great example of being in your value messaging to the menu with a completely new item.<br>
When it comes to value, we typically offered value bundles that are promoted via second-tier messaging to the marketplace. However, in January,<br>we began promoting several bundled offerings ranging from $1 to $5 price points as our primarily media message. Most of the traffic loss in Q1<br>continue to be driven by transactions less than $5, but our value promotions, including the $2 breakfast pockets, helps drive an incremental<br>improvement in under $5 transactions versus Q4.<br>

Delivery is another important initiative that we're making great progress on. Since the end of Q4, we've expanded the delivery to include an<br>additional 478 restaurants. We're now delivering Jack in the Box food from nearly 63% of our system. And we're expecting additional restaurants<br>to begin offering delivery over the course of the year. We continue to see an incremental sales lift in markets where delivery is offered.<br>
Another major restaurant initiative is elevating the brand image though remodels and new construction. We have about 600 restaurants that I'd<br>kindly describe as mature. These restaurants typically have roof lines more than 40 years old, that date the branch and really need to change. The<br>investments that we'll make will largely be tiered, depending on sales levels, meaning locations with lower AUVs will get less investment than<br>those with higher AUVs. You'll see us in partnership with our franchisees implemented over the next 4 years.<br>
Moving on to refranchising. We sold 22 Jack in the Box restaurants to franchisees during first quarter, bringing the system to nearly 89% franchised<br>at quarter end. We have approximately 60 restaurants with signed LOIs, and continue to expect the Jack in the Box franchise mix will reach<br>approximately 95% by the end of fiscal 2018.<br>
This morning, I'd like to update you on the leadership changes we recently announced, and our plans to continue flattening the organization as<br>we evolve our company. Our leadership team is already looking different from what it was at the beginning of the year. Earlier this month, Frances<br>Allen resigned after leading the brand as President for more than 3 years. She anticipated the need to flatten the organization, and graciously<br>suggested that the elimination of her position, so that we can more quickly begin restructuring the brand (inaudible).<br>
Another important change was the addition of Marcus Tom, who joined us this month as Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Marcus brings<br>significant restaurant industry experience in operations leadership position, and will be a key piece of our refocused executive team.<br>
And finally, I want to acknowledge that this will be Jerry Rebel's final call with us. As you know, Jerry informed us last year of his desire to retire and<br>move to Texas so that he could be closer to his family. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Jerry for nearly 15 years of service to the company,<br>and to wish him all the best in honing his golf game in Texas.<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Thank you, Lenny. It's been an honor to be part of the Jack team for all these years.<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
Our new CFO, Lance Tucker, starts at the end of March. Lance will be joining us from Papa John's International, where he is currently Senior Vice<br>President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer. Following the expected sale of Qdoba, we'll still need to provide services to that<br>brand until it becomes completely independent. When that happens, we'll be in a better position to continue restructuring the company and focus<br>exclusively on the Jack in the Box brand.<br>
As we continue to restructure the business, we believe we can lower G&amp;A to less than 2% of systemwide sales. As we approach the back half of the<br>year, we expect to be ready to discuss the timing of G&amp;A reductions and other long-term guidance, including free cash flow targets.<br>
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry for a more detailed look at the first quarter and an update on guidance for the year. Jerry?<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Thank you, Lenny, and good morning, everyone. As we noted in the press release, there were several items that made this quarter a bit messier<br>than usual. When you get beyond the noise, it was relatively clean quarter from an operating standpoint. But before I get into the operating results,<br>I will quickly summarize the items that created the noise. First of all, Qdoba results are shown as discontinued operations for all periods presented,<br>including the Qdoba direct level G&amp;A. However, shared service G&amp;A, which supports both the Jack in the Box brand and the Qdoba brand, remains<br>in continuing operations.<br>

<A name=147></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:30PM, JACK - Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call<br>
Second, was the impact of tax reform, which lowered our statutory federal tax rate but resulted in a one-time noncash charge, relating primarily<br>to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets. This negatively impacted GAAP EPS by $1.03 per share. Third, there was an accounting change that<br>requires us to now treat excess tax benefits from share-based compensations as a component of the tax provision versus additional paid-in capital<br>in the past. This positively impacted GAAP EPS by $0.03 per share.<br>
And lastly, with the increasing focus on EBITDA, we have reclassified all depreciation and amortization to a separate line on the P&amp;L. You can see<br>how this impacted our previously reported metrics, including restaurant operating margins and franchise margin in the non-GAAP reconciliations<br>included in the press release.<br>
Moving on to our operating results for the quarter. Operating EPS was $1.23 as compared to $1.07 last year, driven primarily by a lower tax rate, a<br>reduction in the share count and a decrease in G&amp;A, which were partially offset by the impact of refranchising. The tax act reduced our federal<br>statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, resulting in a blended statutory federal rate of 24.5% for each quarter of our fiscal year,<br>including state taxes, our adjusted Q1 effective tax rate was 28.8% and our estimated tax rate for the fiscal year will be approximately 29%.<br>
Jack in the Box system same-store sales declined 0.2% in Q1. This 0.2% -- the 0.2% increase in company same-store sales was comprised of pricing<br>of approximately 1.6%, mixed benefits of 1% and a decline in transactions of 2.4%. Franchise same-store sales declined 0.3% for the quarter. Jack<br>in the Box company restaurant margins of 22.2% increased by 60 basis points compared to last year, with wage and commodity inflation each<br>above 5% in the quarter. Restaurant operating margin for the stores we intend to keep after refranchising is complete, was 24.6% in the quarter.<br>Excluding depreciation, company restaurant level EBITDA increased by 20 basis points to 26%.<br>
Franchise EBITDA increased by 8.5% to $76 million, due primarily to refranchising. In G&amp;A, excluding depreciation, declined to approximately 2.4%<br>of systemwide sales as compared to 2.7% last year. Our leverage ratio was approximately 3.3x as of the end of the quarter. We are working with<br>our advisors to adjust our capital structure to reflect a less capital-intensive business model. As we said previously at a 95% franchise mix, we are<br>comfortable taking our leverage up to 5x EBITDA as opposed to the 4x we are limited to under our current credit facilities. Although we did not<br>repurchase any shares during the quarter, weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 8% versus last year's first quarter. We have approximately<br>$181 million remaining share repurchase authorization from our Board, and we plan to resume buying back our stock.<br>
Moving on to guidance. Our systemwide sales guidance range for the second quarter is down 1% to up 1%. Through the first 4 weeks of our second<br>quarter we are tracking within the range guided.<br>
Fiscal year guidance we provided at ICR, and January is unchanged.<br>
That concludes our prepared remarks. I'd like to turn the call over to our operator to open it up for questions. Teresa?<br>

Lenny, you mentioned working with advisors to adjust your capital structure pro forma. So if Qdoba closes in April, what do you think you may<br>expect acting on that in the capital return strategy? And when do you think we will get an update from the management team on -- you think<br>about (inaudible) long-term financials in free cash flow targets going forward?<br>

<A name=148></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:30PM, JACK - Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
This is Jerry. Let me handle the capital structure piece question first. I think you would expect to have some update from us, assuming like you said,<br>the -- the day the transaction closes in April, I would expect that you'd see something in terms of capital structure within the May meeting, and I<br>think Lenny will take the second part of that question.<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. If we look at long-term guidance overall and any update to -- with our strategic planning, what you can expect to see happen is in conjunction<br>with Lance joining the company at the end of the March time frame, the closing of Qdoba in April, you'll see a sense of urgency from us to update<br>those plans and be able to get information out to all of you as soon as possible. But we do want to take one step at a time, get our new CFO in<br>position and work through the close which is targeted for April, but we'll make sure that, that happens before we update any long-term plans. So<br>you'll see, as you've seen in the past from us, whether it be with a restructuring or G&amp;A reduction effort, a sense of urgency on our part to move<br>quickly, to get to our new state.<br>
<b>Brian John Bittner</b> - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst<br>
Okay. And just last question, can you just talk a little bit more about your same-store sales guidance of 1% to 2%, what's driving that full year<br>outlook, given it is better than the flattish 1Q results and kind of the flattish 2Q guide, and just any comments on how your single price point value<br>strategy is going would be helpful.<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
Yes, let me handle the single price point strategy. It's -- I would call it a tactic more than a strategy. We had major competitive activity in, particularly<br>in January that we wanted to make sure we were proactive in addressing versus, wait until the end of the quarter to see how it played out. So, I<br>mean the tactic worked well for us, something that we'll repeat if necessary in the future, but it won't be the only tactic, so. And I don't believe that<br>will be consistent with a multiple price point value promotion going forward, but it certainly has shown us that we have some other tools in the<br>tool belt that we can pull out when necessary. Beyond that, when you look at the confidence for the back half of the year, I'd say is, I've just spent<br>the last 2 days and what's interesting about what I'm about to say is, it's fun being a CEO of this company, it's been a great company to work for,<br>but one of the things I've missed the last few years is my involvement in the day-to-day operations and marketing decisions which, with Frances'<br>departure, I'm now extremely involved in and getting more intimate with. And the last couple of days I've had a lot of fun with my franchisees in<br>the kitchen, working alongside my marketing group and my R&amp;D group to shore up the back half of this year's marketing calendar. And we look<br>at what we're going to do in Q3, we've got 2 great offerings. One would be a completely new offering that the we've tested, it's a snack item that<br>will come in at a lower price point, but it's a nice quantity of food with pretty exciting packaging and also very indulgent line of products. So we'll<br>offer that. And then on top of that we've got a great bundle item that we'll put together. We're not sharing specifically what we're going to do at<br>this time, for competitive reasons, but we're all excited about the line up in that quarter, and in addition to that, the franchisees agreed to have<br>the entire system focus on an average check builder, that we'll be doing through upscaling at every restaurant. It will be some items on our menu<br>that are unique to Jack in the Box. So when we get the type of engagement from our operators, it's reason to be optimistic and excited. And then<br>in the last quarter of the year, we're going to move away from sandwiches and promote some of the things that we think we have a license to<br>promote, as a QSR player that has a pretty huge variety on its menu. And so we're going to do things that are differentiated and that make us stand<br>out and we're going to actually extend one of the offerings that we currently have to bring some new news and excitement to an old product. So<br>really excited about that, we're going to bundle that as well in a combo meal. And again, when you look at what will be in that combo, besides for<br>the drink, the other items that will be in that combo are unique to Jack in the Box, so. When we look at a lineup like that, and engagement from<br>our operators, this is where we get excited about the back half of the year.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question is from Dennis Geiger of UBS.<br>
<b>Dennis Geiger</b> - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director and Equity Research Analyst of Restaurants<br>
Thanks for the question, and Jerry, congrats and best of luck. Lenny, just wondering if you could talk a bit more, maybe about franchisee sentiment<br>and profitability right now, maybe some of the perceptions around the new value construct, what they're saying? And then, just building that on<br>that, just as it relates to what you're seeing from a development commitment standpoint? I know there was some commentary, but just how you're<br>thinking about that associated with the refranchisings as we go through the year?<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. So I'll answer the last part of your question first. When we look at the refranchising effort that we're currently initiating, there may be some<br>development agreements that happened with that but that's not the major thrust of that activity. So unlike what we did last year, where we actually<br>slowed down the refranchising activity in order to get development deals signed, this won't look a little different. So we may marginally get some,<br>an uptick in development, but I wouldn't expect that to be a major driver of our business. When you look at franchisee sentiment, essentially, what<br>they're experiencing is rising labor costs and it's putting pressure on their P&amp;Ls, and their major focus is really to drive sales and transactions, to<br>allow them to lever their business positively. So we, and -- I'm not -- that's one of the reasons why I've been excited to get close to the business<br>and close to them, in working through those issues. So again, I said, when you see the type of engagement we experienced over the last 2 days, I<br>mean it was beyond just the back half of the year, it was also examining what the product pipeline would and could look like going forward into<br>2019. I would say that our franchisees are optimistic about the future, but also concerned about their current financial health and want to make<br>sure that the franchise owner is working side-by-side with them, to ensure that they will have a healthy business over the long term.<br>
As far as -- one last thing with the franchisees. As far as their interest in refranchising, that has not waned, and their overall financial health is good,<br>but they certainly don't want to see any deterioration in their margin over time, but we still have a significant interest in -- from our franchisees in<br>getting the remaining sites that we'll be refranchising.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.<br>
<b>John Stephenson Glass</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD<br>
Just first on the current -- the commentary on the current trends, I think you're rolling over some fairly weak comparisons from a year ago. So maybe<br>you could just remind us how the quarter, a year ago progressed? And therefore, if you've faced other comparisons in the back half just of this<br>quarter, how you plan to handle that? And Lenny, I think in your comments, you talked about tactics in January sort of like, it was contained to<br>January from a competitive intensity standpoint. You don't necessarily have to be as intense going forward. Is that the case? Do you feel like the<br>discounting intensity has waned as we've gotten into February? Or is that -- was that not a correct read of that.<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
I don't think the discounting intensity has waned, but I think we're seeing a couple of things that would tell us it may wane. So first off, what<br>happened in January was really just us playing a little bit of defense and making sure that we didn't get caught standing flat-footed in the face of<br>what we knew to be is a pretty extensive, competitive activity. I don't think that the activity is necessarily going to wane overall. But the tactics that<br>we may deploy against it may be a little different. Our franchisees, what they're seeing is that when we launch premium products well, that's a<br>

transaction driver, and it's also a sales driver. And so for them, it's really important that there's a balance over time, as it is for us, the balance over<br>time and focusing on value and premium. And in many cases, we found that when we lean into premium, such as when we launched the Buttery<br>Jack, we actually are getting more success with that than what seems to be a more [possessive] play when we lean into value. So I think you're<br>going to see a healthy balance going forward. When you look at Q1 transactions for our company stores, it improved from down 5.4% to down<br>2.4%, so we think what we did was the right thing, to sort of protect our business and regain some share. But ultimately, when you look at the trend<br>throughout this quarter and into the back half of the year, with the lineup that we have in place, we remain optimistic that we can deliver.<br>
<b>John Stephenson Glass</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD<br>
In this comment about the second quarter a year ago, when I think you were down like 3% this time a year ago, so you're rolling over easier<br>comparisons, how does that rest of that quarter unfold? And are you already lapping tougher compares, if you will, so that you've got better<br>confidence of that 0 or plus or minus 1?<br>
<b>Carol A. DiRaimo</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - VP, Chief IR &amp; Corporate Communications Officer<br>
Yes. So John, the trends that we're tracking in the guidance, that is range versus that down 3%. So there was a lot of chatter last year this time about<br>the delay in tax refunds and from what we can see thus far this year, there hasn't been any improvement or degradation in those trends, but the<br>back half of the quarter was obviously, much more positive than the first part of the quarter last year.<br>
<b>John Stephenson Glass</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD<br>
Okay. And if I could just sneak one more. The G&amp;A targets you're giving now is just the pure G&amp;A versus -- that had some D&amp;A in it before. So it's<br>not an enormous number, but maybe it's $8 million on an annualized basis. So are you looking more favorably on your G&amp;A for the year? Or is that<br>just within the wiggle room of the 2.5% to 2.7% of system sales, so it's not really material to call out?<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, John, it's Jerry. It's within the wiggle room that we provided within the range. If you look at what it was last year, it was just under 20 basis<br>points of D&amp;A, which was in the G&amp;A category. So the target that we have, the longer-term target that we talked about at ICR is less than 2% of<br>systemwide sales, I'd consider that to be cash G&amp;A. So we have excluded the depreciation and amortization, and we also think that, that's a very<br>consistent reporting approach within the period, within the industry here. So that's how we're looking at it.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Next question is from David Tarantino, Robert W. Baird.<br>
<b>David E. Tarantino</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Associate Director of Research and Senior Research Analyst<br>
My question, I just want to come back to the comps outlook and I know you mentioned, Lenny, several factors that give you confidence in the<br>second half, but I guess a question about the environment. Are you assuming that the environment changes or gets better as you move through<br>the year? And I guess related to that, consumers are starting to see lower taxes on their paychecks, so I was wondering if you are assuming any<br>benefit from that, or if that would be upside relative to your current plans?<br>

<A name=151></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:30PM, JACK - Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. So current plans do not assume that there's some catalyst that drives performance. We do expect the environment to be just as competitive<br>in the back half of the year as it's been, really, over the last couple of years. And so if you look at what we're planning to do in Q3, for example, the<br>two things that we'll be promoting. One, more on the premium side, and one more of a sort of snack or value item. Both will be price point<br>promotions, which we don't typically do. We typically have one price point promotion out in the marketplace and another that's sort of unpriced,<br>typically focused on premium. We will, in this case, have competitive pricing on both of the offerings as really some of the additional sort of drivers,<br>or the offerings. So I think our expectation is that it's going to be a competitive market and we really can't afford to take our foot off the gas.<br>
<b>David E. Tarantino</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Associate Director of Research and Senior Research Analyst<br>
Great, that's helpful. And then on the G&amp;A reductions, I know you mentioned that we'll more clarification on the timing of those. But I guess, can<br>you give some high level perspective on how that transition services arrangement works? Is the right way to think about this that you could have<br>sort of minimal or low G&amp;A reductions over the, relative with our current run rate over the next year, and then you'd see a step down after the<br>transition services arrangement ends?<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
So let me talk about the transition services and fees first. So -- well as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the our shared service G&amp;A, even that<br>which currently supports Qdoba, is in our continuing operations. Right after we close the deal, we will begin to receive proceeds from Apollo for<br>the shared services that we're providing for them as part of transition services agreement. It's likely that, that will be shown to offset the G&amp;A the<br>way we would report that, but even if it doesn't, if we try to figure out exactly how that's going to look going forward, we will be very transparent<br>about showing you what the income level is, or the offsets is to that G&amp;A from the transition services compensation that we're getting from Apollo.<br>So you will see a reduction related to that and at least, the back half of the year or post closing.<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
And David, the way you can think about this, what we'll be working through with Apollo is, once we are able to close on the deal, over time we'll<br>understand more details about their plans to become independent, sort of department by department. And as we understand that, it -- then will<br>be a catalyst to us putting our go-forward structures in place.<br>

Next question is from Chris O'Cull with Stifel.<br>
<b>Christopher Thomas O'Cull</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Analyst<br>
Jerry, let me join others on congratulating you on a very successful career. My question relates to the tenant improvement investments. And Jerry,<br>would you describe how the company is evaluating the return on their portion of the investment? And if there's any changes to the rental rate<br>charged to the franchisee after the investment's been made?<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. So the second part of that question, first. There is no rate, there is no change in the rental rate on the extra rental flow-through would come<br>from the increase in the same-store sales that we would get from, resulting from the remodel. The way that we looked at the tenant improvement<br>allowance, I go back to one of the things that Lenny said in his prepared remarks, which is this tiered approach on the overall investment cost,<br>which is based upon sales of higher AUV restaurants, they're going to get a higher investment, they'll get a higher tenant improvement allowance,<br>

then and of course, the opposite would be true for lower performing units. But the way that we looked at this is, we applied the same investment<br>threshold for the tenant improvement allowance for us that we did for our own remodel investment cost for the company-operated restaurants.<br>And so, and the hurdle that we were looking at there was a 15% return on that investment, whether or not it's a tenant improvement allowance<br>or a CapEx for company locations, Chris.<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
Chris, I just want to add about beyond the, beyond just the financial sort of hurdles that we set for ourselves. It's also important from a competitive<br>standpoint to recognize that many of our peers are accelerating remodels in order for our brand to remain competitive and relevant in the consumers'<br>minds. We're going to have to make sure that we do invest in these sites.<br>
<b>Christopher Thomas O'Cull</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Analyst<br>
No, I understand. And then Jerry, I heard you say the stores you're keeping had a 24.6% margin this past quarter, can you tell us what that margin<br>was last year for those stores, and how it's been trending?<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, I can tell you what the -- at the Analyst Day, the Investor Day, that we had, what -- almost a couple of years ago now, we were showing those<br>to be around 300 basis points higher than what they're currently trending, and that is primarily related to significant wage inflation. And then,<br>within the quarter, there's some impact on commodities. Let's say the structural change is in the labor model. The commodities will go up and<br>down over time.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question is from Gregory Francfort of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.<br>
<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
I had 2 questions. One is just on, what will the tax rate be, kind of on a normalized go-forward basis by just -- is 25%, 26%, which is what I'm backing<br>to, kind of a fair number on a go-forward basis. And then the second question was just a follow-up to one that was just asked. I -- what will be, I<br>guess, the stores you keep, post refranchising, what do you expect their restaurant level margins to be now on an ongoing basis, given the change<br>in the D&amp;A, is it just, it's taking 4% and adding it on to sort of what had previously guided a fair way to think about it?<br>
<b>Carol A. DiRaimo</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - VP, Chief IR &amp; Corporate Communications Officer<br>
Yes, so Greg, the restaurant operating margin that we been talking about today is all apples-to-apples to our prior guidance, that's when we talk<br>about the restaurant EBITDA, that depreciation gets added back. And I think we showed that slide at ICR, which I think I have right in front of me.<br>The -- if you look at fiscal '17, the stores that we intended to keep at the end of the refranchising would have had a store level margin for fiscal '17<br>now before the labor and commodity inflation of 26.1%.<br>
<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
So I take 26.1%, add on maybe roughly around 4%, and then take out some margin for inflation, that's the right way to think about long-term<br>margins for the company business?<br>

<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. About long-term EBITDA margin for the business, yes. And then, on the first part of your question, which is by far, the easiest of the 2 questions,<br>by the way, you would be looking at that 25% to 26% range, 21% for federal, and then roughly 4.5% for state would be what an ongoing rate would<br>look like, everything else being equal beginning in fiscal '19 for us.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
The next question is from Alex Slagle of Jefferies.<br>
<b>Alexander Russell Slagle</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Just a couple guidance questions. One on the one-time franchise fees related to refranchising, I want to know whether are those baked in the<br>guidance, I know maybe in the past you had excluded some of those?<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Franchise fees are in the guidance for this year, Alex. And of course, with revenue recognition, accounting change that will be effective for us in<br>our fiscal 2019. You'll see a very different reporting structure where we haven't yet determined which method of adoption we're going to apply<br>yet, but as we get closer to that implementation, we'll describe what that looks like, and how you should expect to see what it looks that going<br>forward. And also, what it would look like in the rearview mirror.<br>
<b>Alexander Russell Slagle</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Got it. And then on the refranchising, the cadence, I mean, which we assume the remaining transactions are sort of evenly split over the next 3<br>quarters or with the nearly 60 signed LOIs, I mean, perhaps a little bit more show up in the second, third quarter, rather than the end of the year?<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. It's not a bad way to model it, going -- throughout the balance of the year, some were ratably, but if you look at, with these roughly 60 LOIs<br>that we have, we have, plus or minus 60 more restaurants to sell beyond that. So it may be a little faster paced than the end of the year, but modeling<br>it evenly is not a bad way to go at this point.<br>

<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. We didn't utilize a similar tactic in January. In January, we put out products that essentially already existed, put price points on them, $1 to $5.<br>When you look at what we're doing going forward, the snack item's a completely new item. It has been tested, and it tested very favorably in the<br>marketplace where we tested it. It's also a significant amount of food, provided at very reasonable price. So we can see consumer sentiment about<br>it is very positive. It's also extremely indulgent, and sort of true to Jack. Something that we can deliver from our menu that many others can't. So I<br>wouldn't say that it's anything like what we've done in January, new news tends to play a lot better for us than just price promotions. So that's why<br>we get a little more optimistic about this one.<br>
<b>Andrew Michael Charles</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - Director<br>
Got it. And Jerry, would G&amp;A at 2.4% of system sales in 1Q is obviously below the full year guidance range and before obviously, the final tranche<br>of your franchising, sort of plan for this year, really kicking in. What drove the reiterated guidance for 2.5% and 2.7% besides conservatism?<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
I really call it primarily timing. If you look historically, the Q1 G&amp;A tends to be lower than the full year guidance that we just started to ramp up<br>some of those initiatives and whatnot. So -- and then there's always some play with respect to what mark to market on those nonqualified retirement<br>plans do, so there's always some fluctuation there. And then we had a little delay in some equity grants, which changed the timing of that amortization<br>over the balance of the year, with a amortization of those costs in Q1.<br>
<b>Andrew Michael Charles</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - Director<br>
Got it and if I can sneak one last one in. What drove the heavier CapEx in 1Q '18 versus 1Q '17, with your company restaurants. Does that reflect<br>the new equipment that you talked about testing?<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
It's really more of the remodel activity that we have within the quarter, both on some of the remodels that have been completed, some that are<br>ongoing, and then also some of the IT investments around digital.<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
It's not a big impact at this point. We've got just a small handful of company operation sites that are testing equipment. At this point in time, we'll<br>have somewhere around 15 franchise locations that will get involved in that testing period in the short term, but those will all be marginal in<br>comparison to what, the weight of the remodel on overall capital.<br>

<b>Jeffrey Daniel Farmer</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Restaurant Analyst<br>
Just want to add my congratulations to Jerry, impressive long career. Moving to the question, just circling back to one of the first questions, just<br>for some clarity. So what was asked that one that could all the sales complete, what type of information you guys will be providing for us over sort<br>of the longer-term guidance framework? And a lot of times, we look at what was provided at that May of 2016 Analyst Day, and to the best of my<br>knowledge, that was just was a lot of information about Future CapEx levels.

both operating cash flow and CapEx numbers, so we can really get a much broader understanding of what the free cash flow picture will look like,<br>'18, '19, '20, '21, for example?<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Generally, the answer to that is yes. We'll provide all of that clarity. And I think the timing of providing that clarity, won't fully be determined until<br>we have Lance onboard. And have -- and give him an opportunity to work with us on designing all that, but you'll have everything from the details<br>on free cash flow to EBITDA, CapEx, same-store sales margins, G&amp;A. You should be able to build out your models pretty readily.<br>
<b>Jeffrey Daniel Farmer</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Restaurant Analyst<br>
Okay, and then last question, unrelated. Any surprises or I would say, lessons learned with how your customers were using, I believe, those called<br>value Jack's way menu, basically the $1 to $5 price point menu? Anything that surprised you? How are the customers using it, anything that you<br>can use as you move forward in terms of sort of balancing more of the premium products versus and dispersing it with value?<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
I guess what I would say is, we've been doing a fair amount of research on where consumers historically find the most value on our menu. And not<br>surprisingly, our taco offering has been quite popular, it also turned out to be quite popular within our $1 to $4 offering. And if there are lessons<br>learned, it would really be along the lines of what we can do to enhance our sales through featuring tacos. And so, that's sort of one big thing. As<br>far as the other offerings, when we have things like breakfast pockets that are sort of new news, they're a sort of innovation for us, but they're also<br>show up in our value price point. We tend to do a little bit better with those products as well. We tend to take existing products and since we<br>discount them, although we'll get a higher take rate, we also have to be careful about what the impact is to margin, so those aren't necessarily the<br>most preferred method. And when we bundle items with a drink, a side and an entr�e, that historically, had been our best play. So I think when<br>we come out of this $1 through $5 price point time frame, some of the things that we've seen are right in concert with what we've sort of always<br>known. When we look at, behaviorally, the consumers' take rate on our taco offerings within that $1 to $5 price point, it gives us some optimism<br>about what we may be able to do with tacos in the future.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
The next question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.<br>
<b>Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst<br>
A couple of questions. One, just on the unit growth. I mean, I think we're in the 1% range, driven by franchisees this year. As you think out over the<br>next few years, should you see stable fundamentals, I have franchisees, some tax savings, I'm assuming there is some significant refranchising<br>opening commitments. What's kind of your outlook over the next few years. Obviously, you'll give guidance at some point, but directionally, should<br>we just assume a steady uptick in that growth rate and maybe could provide some context, how many franchise open commitments do you actually<br>have, or for how many units do you have commitments at this point so we know what's already in the bag?<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
What I would say, overall, we should wait until we update guidance, provide more clarity on that. What I will say is that the vast majority of the<br>growth that you see right now is Jack in the Box brand, almost all of it is franchise growth. So the commitments there, and I think that franchisees<br>are optimistic about the business over the long term, so I don't expect that their commitment will wane. At the same time, they need to know that,<br>they need to see those numbers show up and I think what you can see us boasting on, about testing a new equipment that can drive efficiencies<br>

in our kitchen, as well as focused on driving top line sales through product innovation, those are the things that give them a sense of security, that<br>their investments pay off over the long term. But I would say, we'd be a little premature to model you any significant uptick in growth. I would wait<br>until we have enough to really update the long term plan.<br>
<b>Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst<br>
Got it. And then, Lenny, just the broader thoughts on the multi-brand portfolio. I mean, many of your peers contemplate whether a single brand<br>or a multi-brand portfolio is the right strategy, going from multi to single. I'm just wondering what do you think are the greatest benefits you're<br>going to lose from going back down to single? On the opposite side of that, I guess, what would be the biggest benefit you think you'd gain from<br>not running a multi-brand portfolio?<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
I think if we, if we really take -- if we're being completely transparent and honest, The Street never fully embraced Jack in the Box being a multibranded<br>concept. And so, we grew this thing from 86 units to 700-plus units in that entire time frame, 10-plus years. We never fully got acceptance of this<br>business model. At the end of the day, you had competing interests, right? On the one hand, you want at the asset like business. And on the other<br>hand, you have this growth business. And they don't, from an investment community standpoint, work hand-in-hand, they're not clean. So if there's<br>one lesson learned about it, it would be that this type of model, in a publicly-traded situation, probably doesn't make sense because it's just too<br>complex. And so what we lose, I think we lose EBITDA, right? At the end of the day, the -- look, you have a business, was generating some positive<br>cash flow for us, that created some efficiencies on the G&amp;A side and we're going to have to relook at how we, you know, run the model going<br>forward. But I think, outside of those things, net-net, moving to one brand will turn out to be a very positive thing for our business.<br>
We're going to be a much more agile company, with a leaner structure with fewer layers to go through to get things done. And that's sort of what<br>our roots are, it fuels a lot of our innovation. And I experienced that this week, right? We've already begun to engage franchisees differently. We<br>have all these committees that existed for both brands that got managed by brand services leaders, as well as brand leaders, and that all flattened<br>down to essentially me and my direct reports working directly with franchisees on the future of the company. It seems easy, it seems like we can<br>move much faster than we typically do. And we sat around this same table that I'm at today, talking to you, talking to franchisees about the future<br>and product innovation and also equipment testing. It was amazing how open they were to taking risks that would help us to accelerate our<br>performance. So from that standpoint, I think yesterday, when I walked out of 2 full-day sessions with franchisees, several folks are saying, how are<br>you doing? Are you tired? You seem extremely energized at this point. I mean, I am, because my franchisees are excited, they're engaged, we're<br>moving much faster. It seems that what has taken us weeks or months to make, we made in 2 days. And so net-net, I think our leadership teams<br>would tell you, and I will tell you, this will turn out to be a net positive for us. We're just much closer to the business, and I'm excited personally, to<br>be much closer to them.<br>

<b>Matthew Robert McGinley</b> - Evercore ISI, Research Division - Restaurant Analyst<br>
My first question is on the trend in the remodel process. I understand there's a lot of factors that go into, when you would do that, given franchisee<br>profitability, your contributions, the type of remodel. But how do you think that trends over the next 4 years? Is that something where you do a lot<br>of cheaper, lower AUV remodels up front? Or is it something that just takes 4 years, and you just do a quarter of those remodels per year?<br>

<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
So we -- it won't work the way you described, where we kind of do cheaper up front. It'll be dispersed in a way that really had some of the more<br>expensive remodels happening earlier in the process. And then later in the process, I think we'll not only be faster at getting them done, but they'll<br>be the less intensive ones. And really, what that comes down to is some of the buildings that we will remodel early in the process just require more<br>work and more time. So they're a little more costly, and they have some downtime associated with them. Some of the sites that we will remodel<br>later in the process, we won't have to shut those sites down completely. The drive-thrus will remain open, and we can sort of work around the<br>drive-thru to get that work done. So maybe a little more intense and expensive for the earlier remodels, is the way you should think about.<br>
<b>Matthew Robert McGinley</b> - Evercore ISI, Research Division - Restaurant Analyst<br>
Got it, and for Jerry, I have a question on the tax rate guide for the year. If the adjusted effective rate was 28.8%, I believe you said in the first quarter.<br>In the full year guidance, still 29%. But in the first quarter, you would've had, most of that quarter would've had the higher 35% federal rate. And<br>for the rest of the year, you should be at the lower 21% federal rate, why is the guide for the year still 29%?<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
The way that you have to do this is, you're really looking at the overall blended rate for the entire year, and that's what the rate is for each quarter.<br>And so what you basically are seeing is, for the year and for each quarter is, 1 calendar quarter at 35%, 3 calendar quarters at 21%, but that is shown<br>evenly throughout the year, for each quarter. It's not logical, but that's the way that you have to do it.<br>

Next question is from Robert Derrington of Telsey Advisory Group.<br>
<b>Robert Marshall Derrington</b> - Telsey Advisory Group LLC - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst<br>
Lenny, can you give us a little bit of color about your thought process as you look at the recent food truck series sandwiches you introduced? And<br>kind of what the thought is there? And what your initial impression is of what they're doing with the business, as far as sales go?<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. So we, so first of all, I'd say, the food truck series really represents 2 things: One, I'd say from an advertising standpoint, Jack's got his swagger<br>back. I mean, we had gotten, I think, a little too conservative in the way we use Jack in our advertising. Frances really, along with our Chief Marketing<br>Officer, [Ivana], started pushing for us to get a little more aggressive and back to the old personality for Jack. And I think it played really well, and<br>I think bringing in Martha Stewart played really well. It's more in line with the persona that helped us cut through a lot of advertising noise, even<br>though we're a regional player. So I think the first headline is on an advertising side, has worked extremely well, and it's also indicative of what you<br>can expect to see from us going forward. As far as product development, really happy with the food truck series. It has done well for us, but I think<br>we can do even better, and after spending a couple of days with my franchisees, if we were to evaluate the food truck series today, versus the<br>months passed before we launched it, we may have actually doubled down on even more protein on those sandwiches than we're currently<br>offering, in order to ramp up the quantity in the sandwich. And we looked at similar sandwiches and even line extensions for food truck series these<br>last couple of days, where all of us were aligned around really wanting to knock the customer's socks off when they bite into these sandwiches. So<br>that might mean price points have to change in the future, in order to achieve that level of quality. But I think, if we're going to have to be aggressive<br>on the value side, we don't want to lose our brand equities that we've built up on the quantity side, and so it's going to be important that we<br>continue to put these wild products out there. I would say on a scale of 1 to 10, food truck series, maybe it's a 7, and I think we can get to a 10 if<br>we're willing to commit fully to high-quality items going forward.<br>

If I try and reconcile for 1Q '17 G&amp;A that was -- or SG&amp;A that was reported last year versus the<br>restated number this year, it looks like it's about $15 million lower. Taking out the DNA that got reallocated and Qdoba advertising, I end up with<br>about a little over $6 million, that seems to be allocated to Qdoba. But I'm trying to reconcile that with what you said it was sort of a $14.2 million<br>Qdoba allocation back at ICR, because it would seem like that $6 million would annualize to something a lot higher.<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, Karen. So actually, I appreciate getting that information before the call, so I was able to a look at it. The roughly $6 million that you had is<br>allocated, it's really not allocated. I had a slightly different number, but we're in the ballpark. That was direct Qdoba brand G&amp;A, and that would be<br>consistent with what the direct Qdoba brand G&amp;A was for the full year, because I think we said, that was $14.2 million. The reason that you can't<br>annualize that is because the first quarter of last year, Qdoba had a cost in there for an assumed incentive payment at their target levels. And by<br>the time we got to the end of the year with the Qdoba performance, there was no target level or there really wasn't much of an incentive compensation<br>payment at all. So you really can't look at the roughly $6 million of direct G&amp;A in Q1 and extrapolate that, so. But the $14.2 million was the right<br>direct Qdoba G&amp;A for last year. I think you're close enough for the quarter.<br>
<b>Karen Holthouse</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - VP<br>
Okay, that makes sense. And then one of the things we were talking about at this point last year was some weakness in the Hispanic consumer on<br>the back of the election. I know that's a demographic that you over indexed to. What are you seeing there? And then you -- is there, sort of what<br>are you seeing in the trends there? And how do you think about, sort of spending patterns last year in the, call it, Hispanic consumer comparison<br>in the coming months, versus where we are now?<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
I don't think that we're seeing anything currently, that would create concern about the strength of the Hispanic consumer, more so than the<br>concerns we would have over an abundance of value in the marketplace, and the high take rates associated with that value, and its difficultly in<br>breaking through some of that noise, at times. But I don't know the specifics about the Hispanic consumer's strength, but we certainly don't have<br>any data points at this point in time that would tell us that something has changed dramatically, but it's certainly is something we'll continue to<br>take a look at.<br>

<A name=159></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:30PM, JACK - Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Carol A. DiRaimo</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - VP, Chief IR &amp; Corporate Communications Officer<br>
Operator, I think we have time -- we're right at up on the time, but we have time for -- we'll take one more question.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our question is from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities.<br>
<b>Matthew James DiFrisco</b> - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Equity Analyst<br>
I just had a clarification, not a question. I just -- did you guys specify earlier in the call what the Jack in the Box brand in 2018 is going to give as far<br>as either operating cash or free cash flow in correlation with the CapEx and EBITDA numbers?<br>
<b>Carol A. DiRaimo</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - VP, Chief IR &amp; Corporate Communications Officer<br>
We did not, Matt.<br>
<b>Matthew James DiFrisco</b> - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Equity Analyst<br>
Okay. I guess, also in, Lenny, when you're looking at the remodels and in years past, other companies, not necessarily you guys, you've done a great<br>job of not having a lot of closings, but other companies that had some closings pick up when they have remodels and the context of the inflation<br>that's out there and the value promotion, do you model in there with the longer-term growth projections the potential for a pickup and closings,<br>or have you already sort of vetted the temperature of the franchise network?<br>
<b>Leonard A. Comma</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO<br>
I'm not sure if I fully understood your question.<br>
<b>Carol A. DiRaimo</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - VP, Chief IR &amp; Corporate Communications Officer<br>
Maybe I'll take that one. So Matt, with the refranchising that we've done, that's really where a lot of the vetting in terms of closing discount. Our<br>guidance that we give on unit growth is gross and not net. It's typically the stores that we're closing are obviously much lower volume. But when<br>we look at the remodels, we're not going to put in a lot of capital into a store that we think is not worthy of those sorts of investments, that's it's<br>not going to be in the long-term plan.<br>
<b>Jerry P. Rebel</b> - Jack in the Box Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. Matt, I would look at this as not necessarily closing because of the remodel, but on some lower performing units, you may see that franchisees<br>choose not to want to slide up for the next lease extension, if it is a substantially lower cash flow generating unit.<br>
<b>Matthew James DiFrisco</b> - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Equity Analyst<br>
Exactly. So to that point, has that -- is that another thing to be updated on later, as we go further down?<br>

I don't -- I think Carol's right. The -- in the uptick, you see it's really related to refranchising some of the lower-performing markets, but the other<br>thing I just described is the usual and ongoing, and I wouldn't expect to see an uptick from that at all.<br>

Okay, we're going to get started here. Happy to have the guys from AGCO here this morning. To my direct right, Andy Beck, who is the CFO; and<br>to his right, Greg Peterson, from Investor Relations. So thanks, guys, for coming out this morning. We'll just get -- launch right into Q&amp;A, unless you<br>guys have anything or -- and then...<br>
<b>Andrew H. Beck</b> - AGCO Corporation - Senior VP &amp; CFO<br>
No, that's good.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Okay, good. And then just if you have questions as we go along, just raise your hand and I'll get to you. So yes, maybe, Andy, just start from an<br>overall industry perspective. Maybe just as you think about your 3 major geographic regions of North, South America as well as Europe, from an<br>industry perspective, and there's probably too much focus on this in kind of looking at point estimates. But as you look at your outlook for '18<br>relative to one of your peers that reported on Friday, there's a little bit more of a gap kind of emerging here. I'm just curious in terms of if you weigh<br>in, in terms of whether that's you being more conservative, they being more optimistic. Just -- and kind of comment about just what you're seeing<br>across the markets with respect to that.<br>
<b>Andrew H. Beck</b> - AGCO Corporation - Senior VP &amp; CFO<br>
Okay, no problem. Yes, I don't think -- do I need to push this button? I don't think we're probably too -- as far apart as everyone thinks. One of the<br>differences is that we do have different year-ends, and the fourth quarter was -- and it showed some improvement in both Europe and North<br>America, which has factored in their numbers probably a little more than ours. But in general, I think we're seeing some of the same impacts. If you<br>start in North America, our forecast is that it's going to be relatively flat. But we do see some of the same dynamics they're seeing. So in the larger<br>equipment, we do expect to see some improvement. What we are seeing is a little more impetus towards customers wanting to replace equipment,<br>which we haven't seen over the last few years. I think we started talking about that a little bit mid-year 2017, and certainly, we think that's going<br>to carry over, over the next few years. As farmers have had their equipment for 4 to 5 years, they have that need to start to replace it, either from<br>trying to get back into a warranty period with new equipment, or just to avoid risks around maintenance cost, downtime, those kinds of things.<br>So I do think we're seeing the same type of trends there that should help the market, to some extent. Now that replacement demand, I think, is<br>going to help. But certainly, to drive a real significant quick upturn in demand, we need to see stronger farm income, which is driven by commodity<br>prices. So we're still waiting for that to see a more robust recovery in North America. But at least, the trend's moving in the right direction at this<br>point. What we also are expecting is maybe some -- a little softening on the small equipment side. The industry has been extremely robust over<br>the last couple years as the economy -- the general economy has improved, those small tractors have different demand drivers than what we see<br>in row crops so it's more general economic conditions, a little more around dairy, livestock. And so those markets have been pretty strong and we<br>

<A name=163></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:45PM, AGCO - AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference<br>
expect to see maybe some modest pulling back from these kind of record levels that we've seen. So the demand will still be above average and<br>still be very strong, but that might be some of the differences in what we see versus some of our competitors. As we move to Europe, which is one<br>of our -- which is our most important market, what we've seen is an improvement in demand over the course of 2018 -- 2017. A lot of that demand<br>increase was driven by improvements in the profitability of the dairy sector as pricing in that market has improved. And so I think we're still feeling<br>some of the tailwinds from that recovery into the first part of 2018. But we do expect that to somewhat level off. There's a lot of expectations that<br>dairy prices might pull back a little during the course of this year, so I'm not sure that there's going to be additional legs to that area. But I do think<br>that demand continues to be relatively good in that sector. When you look at the row crop or cereal farmers in Europe, same kind of situation as<br>what we see in North America. The fleet is starting to age a little, so there's starting to be more need to replace equipment. Their typical amortization<br>period for equipment is probably 5 years, so they're starting to get past that in terms of where they are. And if they want to keep that tax deduction,<br>maybe there's some demand drivers there. Opposing that is where we are just in terms of their profitability and where commodity prices are, they're<br>on -- at the lower end of the levels. And so from that standpoint, we think that, that will somewhat mitigate that demand driver. So we expect to<br>see a good market in Europe and a steady market in 2018. South America, again, a lot of different drivers there. I think from a -- just a pure profitability<br>standpoint, farmers are in pretty good shape. They should have margins and better soy bean crops this year, based on where pricing and exchange<br>rate levels are today. The FINAME program, which is important in terms of financing, is at relatively high interest rates right now, because the normal<br>Brazilian interest rates have now come down to such an extent that, that FINAME rate is not really that attractive. So that's not really a demand<br>driver at this point. And we might expect to see some help with that as they renew the FINAME program midyear this year, so we're hoping to see<br>some improvements in the rates. So there might be some element of farmers looking at that and waiting to see what happens with the FINAME<br>rates. Other than that, there's obviously a political situation. We have an election year, so that drives a little uncertainty in the marketplace as well<br>and maybe mitigates some desires for farmers to invest heavily. So overall, kind of a balanced view. And so we think the market will be kind of flat<br>to slightly up in Brazil this year.<br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Got it. That's helpful. Maybe a question you may get once or twice today, just relating to underlying inflation and steel costs. And so maybe just<br>focus a little bit there in terms of what AGCO has done over the years to mitigate some of your risk through some of the sourcing and global<br>purchasing initiatives, and then how that potentially mitigates the impact, and then, ultimately, the industry's ability to get pricing?<br>
<b>Andrew H. Beck</b> - AGCO Corporation - Senior VP &amp; CFO<br>
Sure. Yes. Obviously, it's one of the areas of cost risk that we have is steel prices. It's an important part of our cost structure of our equipment, and<br>so it's something that we're monitoring very closely. In general, we've been very successful in our purchasing activities. We've moved from kind of<br>a fragmented regional structure to a more global purchasing organization over the last 5 or 6 years. That's been very successful for us in terms of<br>better leveraging the buy that we have and also moving to a more global supply base, so moving into lower-cost environments so that we can<br>generate savings that way. So year-over-year, we're seeing improvement in our material cost structure relative to the pricing that we're getting,<br>so we're generating a net price improvement every year. And we think that we can continue to do that. As it relates, in general, to the steel situation,<br>our -- as you point out, our industry has been pretty good about passing on those inflationary level type costs. And so if we get something that's<br>unusual this year in terms of costs associated with the steel, I would expect that we'll try to pass that on because we do want to -- in order to meet<br>our targets, we want to have that 60, 70 basis point net pricing that we talked about in our prior conference calls. We -- the advantage that we have<br>is that we're not a direct buyer of a lot of steel. We're buying components from suppliers that have steel, so there's typically a 3- to 6-month lag<br>period between when the steel price moves and when it starts to hit us. And so that gives us a little time to get pricing in and have the visibility in<br>place to try to have that not affect our margins too much.<br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Of the 3 regions, where is that easiest in terms of your ability to respond with pricing?<br>

<b>Andrew H. Beck</b> - AGCO Corporation - Senior VP &amp; CFO<br>
I would say, probably Europe would be the easiest and then North America would be very similar as well.<br>
<b>Greg Peterson</b> - AGCO Corporation - Director of IR<br>
Tim, one of the other areas that we're a little bit different in is where we source our equipment from. We have our manufacturing located, in most<br>cases, where we sell the equipment. So we're pretty well balanced from a geographic perspective. But in the U.S., I think we're more -- tend to be<br>more of an importer of finished goods, maybe as much as 15% or so of our total sales in the U.S. come from -- maybe half of that is from Europe<br>and then the other half from Asia and India. So maybe a little more [projected], too, because some of the manufacturing is done outside of the U.S.<br>So that's something else to keep in mind.<br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Okay. That's lower than what it would have been 5 years ago, I guess, given the (inaudible)?<br>
<b>Greg Peterson</b> - AGCO Corporation - Director of IR<br>
It is. Yes. So, yes, we do -- even though we do have major factories in Kansas and Minnesota and Illinois, we do still bring in some -- well, components,<br>but also some finished product into the U.S., yes.<br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
In terms of the direct quantification, I know it's not easy because some of it's raw versus processed. But I think, Andy, you've said in the past, it's<br>like 1/4 of the raw material buy is steel. Is that still an accurate number?<br>
<b>Andrew H. Beck</b> - AGCO Corporation - Senior VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, I think so. Or maybe another way to look at it is probably a little north of 15% of our cost -- total costs would be steel related.<br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Okay, got it. Maybe switching gears to just market share across the regions. In '18, as I believe it is in every year, the assumption is that you gain<br>some market share overall. Are there specific regions or products that maybe you're more optimistic on for '18 in terms of gaining some market<br>share?<br>
<b>Andrew H. Beck</b> - AGCO Corporation - Senior VP &amp; CFO<br>
Well, we always plan for market share growth, and I think we have been pretty successful. Usually, as you point out, that market share is driven by<br>new product introductions, so something new to the market that we're providing. In '17, we did a pretty good job in terms of market share<br>improvement in North America, mainly around the small tractors that we've introduced during '16 and '17. We've really gotten a boost from the<br>new equipment that were -- we designed, it's a product that comes out of China. It's called our Global Series and it's selling quite well all around<br>the world. And that's helping us not only in the U.S. but in Europe. And we're now introducing some of those new products into South America<br>starting last year, and then we'll have another round of them in 2019 in Brazil. So that's certainly an area where we have some good momentum.<br>We also have some new products on the very highest end of the market. We talked a number of times about a new product out of our Fendt<br>manufacturing group, it's called the X1000, it's a larger traditional frame tractor than our competition sells. It gives the product a little more flexibility<br>of use. And that has sold very well in Europe as well as in North America under the Challenger brand. And so we're seeing some growth there. And<br>

<A name=165></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:45PM, AGCO - AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference<br>
we're introducing that product now in some of the other markets around the world like Australia, South Africa and even into Brazil. So that product<br>line should continue to help us. It's not big units, but it's a big dollar product. And then we have some new products coming out in 2018 around a<br>brand new tractor in North America that we also sell in Europe. We won an award in Europe on that product, so that's -- should sell very well. We<br>also have a new sprayer coming out in North America and we expect to see some growth in that market for AGCO. So it's generally around the<br>pace of new product introduction. And as you can tell by looking at our investments and engineering expense, we have increased that over time.<br>So over the last decade, we might have doubled -- almost tripled our investment in engineering expense. And so that gives us the chance to<br>introduce product at a more rapid pace, and that gives us an opportunity to grow those market shares a little more freely. So I think it all kind of<br>ties back to our investment strategy. And then, obviously, improvements in distribution as well that's helping us do -- win in the marketplace.<br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Got it. Just touching on new products. Maybe the combine segment is not one that AGCO has been a big player globally, from a market share<br>perspective, but obviously, the new IDEAL launch coming this year. What are your expectations? I think you had talked about like a $300 million<br>number in terms of revenue potential. What -- over what time frame and what markets are likely to drive -- where is this going to be more targeted?<br>
<b>Andrew H. Beck</b> - AGCO Corporation - Senior VP &amp; CFO<br>
Okay. So taking a step back, AGCO's growth strategy, we still are, I guess, more heavily weighted than we'd like to ultimately be in terms of having<br>our sales be around the tractor business. So we would like to grow globally and leverage our distribution capabilities and our strong dealer network<br>selling non-tractor products, and that includes combines, hand-forged equipment, sprayers, those types of products. And so a lot of that additional<br>money that we've put in product development has obviously been in refreshing our tractor offering but also in these new other products, these<br>complementary products outside of tractors. And one of the big ones was -- is combines, and we've talked a lot in our December meeting about<br>the new IDEAL combine. We introduced that late in 2017 at the big farm show in Germany called Agritechnica. It was the Machine of the Year, and<br>so it's gotten a lot of good publicity and a lot of good feedback from customers and analysts about the product. It's kind of a clean sheet of paper<br>design that will enable us to have better features and have better performance of any combines that we sell today, and we think it'll be very<br>competitive versus what our competition has in the market. It also provides us with an opportunity to have a more global platform for the product.<br>Right now, we have 7 or 8 different combine platforms or designs that we're producing and selling around the world, and this will reduce and<br>eliminate probably 5 or 6 of those into 1. So it's going to be a product that we can produce in Europe, U.S. and in Brazil and enable us to have the<br>ability to have one design, leverage purchasing better, obviously, leverage design costs and those kinds of things. So the plan for that product is<br>that we're continuing to do the testing and fine-tuning the design of the product this year. We will produce 70 or 80 combines this year and have<br>an extensive demonstration program and marketing program in our markets, particularly in Europe and North America, this year. But we won't be<br>selling any of the equipment this year, it's more about marketing and fine-tuning of the product. In 2019, we'll start to sell the product. And so as<br>we talked about, our goal was to get maybe $300 million or so of sales. That would probably be over -- once we start selling it, maybe over a 3-year<br>period, something like that. So we're 3, 4 years away from reaching those goals. So this is something that is -- we're very excited about. We think<br>we have a product that will be successful in the market, and we're trying to make sure that we do this the right way in terms of getting the product<br>right, marketing it in the right way so that we are successful over the long term.<br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Interesting. Maybe talk a bit about M&amp;A. You've been fairly active both on the equipment side, as well as GSI. So maybe just update us there in<br>terms of, I guess, I'll start with GSI in terms of whether -- are there -- I mean, you've done a lot of kind of build out the portfolio there. Is there more<br>to go in terms of products that you feel you need to be in on either on the protein or the storage side?<br>

Well, that's a very fragmented industry. So there always are bolt-on opportunities there. I would say that, at this point, we think we're in pretty<br>good shape, so the focus this year would probably be a little more on integration rather than new acquisitions. But we're always very opportunistic<br>

as it relates to acquisitions. And so if something comes up that we think we can add value through being able to leverage it through our distribution<br>networks, gives us an advantage in a geography we're not strong in, we'll certainly consider it. But we have, I think, filled out our product lines at<br>GSI quite well, so on the protein production side, we're now -- really have a good product line as it relates to poultry, swine and now, with some<br>of these recent acquisitions, in the egg business as well. So we support producers in all those markets now, and that gives us a good flexibility<br>because those markets do vary from year-to-year in terms of being up or down, so it gives us a little more stability in terms of our profitability. On<br>the grain side, we've expanded not only in looking at grain storage, but also the -- all the material handling and conditioning equipment. One of<br>our acquisitions, it was a few years ago, was in the commercial side of the business. So we can handle big commercial conveyance products now,<br>which gives us some opportunities to grow not only in the U.S. but outside the U.S., like in Brazil, Eastern Europe and those kinds of things. So I<br>think we have a good -- we probably have the broadest product line in the industry. We're a more global company than most of our competitors.<br>And a lot of our customers are global customers. And so we think being able to support them in all the markets will be a big selling advantage for<br>us as we bid on project -- new projects for those companies.<br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Interesting. And going back to -- you started with North America and that maybe you're a little bit more optimistic on the higher horsepower<br>markets. Would you expect to see a similar kind of directional relationship with your storage sales in North America, just given the -- if you actually<br>do start to see some spending on the row crop on the equipment side, would that extend it?<br>
<b>Andrew H. Beck</b> - AGCO Corporation - Senior VP &amp; CFO<br>
I think it will, to some extent. We are seeing some recovery in actual storage area. What's lagging more is on the commercial side. Big projects at<br>port or transport locations or in processing centers for the big producers. And so those, I think, have been held up a little by industry consolidation<br>and some profitability issues by some of the big producers. And so I'd think as those markets recover and some of the consolidation like in the seed<br>industry and things like that recover or get -- we get through that, then we'll see that demand start to pick up as well.<br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Okay. And speaking of -- shifting gears to tax reform here in the U.S. Obviously, just given the profitability, where it is in North America, not realizing<br>the benefit. But have you looked -- or are you further along in terms of potential capital or structural -- capital structure changes in terms of maybe<br>issuing more debt in Europe? Maybe just speak there in terms of what you potentially can do to take more advantage of the lower tax rates here?<br>
<b>Andrew H. Beck</b> - AGCO Corporation - Senior VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. So give everyone a little background, and what we're talking about here is our ability to improve our U.S. profitability. Right now, we're in a<br>loss position in the U.S. because of the weak market, and so we're not benefiting losses in the U.S., so that's driving our tax rate up. And so one of<br>the advantages of the new tax reform is our ability to move unremitted profits that we've generated in Europe or outside the U.S. back into the<br>U.S. and so -- on a more ratable basis. And so by doing that, we think we -- one of our strategies will be to delever our U.S. balance sheet, reduce<br>the amount of interest expense we have in the U.S. and then move it into Europe or other markets where we can get a tax deduction for it. And so<br>that should help our tax rate overall. And so we're in the planning process right now, and we have to look at where we can put that debt into<br>Europe. And then, obviously, there's structuring issues with what debt we can retire and the timing of it and things like that. So this will be a process<br>that we'll be working on over the course of this year and probably even into the next few years, depending on when the debt -- when we can retire<br>the debt and things like that. So it's not a quick fix, but something that's going to be a longer-term opportunity for us and it should help our tax<br>rate modestly over the next few years as a result.<br>

<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Just going back to the new product introductions. I guess, you're kind of looking to get away -- or to get to lower exposure to tractor. So I guess,<br>where do you see holes in the current portfolio? Where would you think to grow or to introduce new products, one? And then two, how does the<br>profitability of these new product introductions compare to more traditional tractor offerings?<br>
<b>Andrew H. Beck</b> - AGCO Corporation - Senior VP &amp; CFO<br>
I think we're feeling better and better about our product lineup. I think it's the best AGCO's ever had. Through one of our acquisitions we did in<br>2017, we filled a hole that we had in our hay and forage -- European hay and forage offering. It's a baler and a loader wagon that we didn't have,<br>which was not allowing us to feel like we could aggressively ask our dealers to sell our hay and forage line compared to the competitive lines they<br>were carrying. And so now we have a big full-line strategy that we're unveiling in Europe to where we want to have, in our Massey, in our Fendt<br>brands, a full line, which is tractors, hay and forage and combines that we offer and have our dealers aggressively selling on our behalf. And so our<br>dealers are very excited about that opportunity because of the new line up that we have. And so I think through acquisitions and product development<br>over the last few years, we feel like we have the best lineup that we've ever had. Obviously, we always want to get better and we'll continue to<br>develop new features, new capabilities, but there's not something, I think, we'd point out and say, &quot;Well, we have a big hole that we still need to<br>fill.&quot; In terms of profitability, those products, combines, hay and forage equipment typically are at or above the margin capabilities that we have<br>on our tractor side if we can get that to the appropriate levels of volume that we need. One of the disadvantages we've had like in the combine<br>business is we've been at a relatively low market share. And that just -- we just don't have the scale in order to get the margins where our competition<br>has them right now. So the more we can grow with a better featured product and gain some volume there, that's going to accelerate the margins<br>in those products. So the other aspect of it is those are typically at least as good or better from a parts standpoint. So there's more maintenance,<br>more parts that you have to continue to replace on those types of pieces of equipment. So that's a benefit to our parts operation and a benefit to<br>the service revenue for our dealers. So it's a profit opportunity for our dealers, makes our dealers stronger, as well.<br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Sticking with the parts comment, Andy. It's obviously been a good growth driver for you in Europe. I think there's been some recent, I guess,<br>streamlining in North America amongst the dealers. So can you see -- maybe speak to the opportunity in terms of driving higher parts capture,<br>irrespective of when the combine is launched, just from an overall dealer standpoint in North America as result of it?<br>
<b>Greg Peterson</b> - AGCO Corporation - Director of IR<br>
Sure. Absolutely, Tim. So we've spoken a good bit about increasing our investments in engineering and product development. And with that,<br>typically, that means, in a lot of cases, higher-end products, more sophistication, which lends themselves to a dealer involvement with maintenance,<br>which is a very good thing when you look at parts and share of parts business. And so what we've then done is layer on our capabilities for dealers.<br>We've implemented SAP -- a global SAP parts system for our dealers, and what that has done is dramatically increase the response time -- or reduce<br>the response time, I should say, for having parts available for our end customers. And that usually is the #1 concern of a farmer is downtime. So to<br>the extent we can minimize that and layering also with some of the precision farming capabilities that we have in terms of proactive monitoring,<br>that also is helping as we move towards reducing that downtime. So enabling our dealers to provide higher levels of service is helping us grow<br>our parts business. So I think you mentioned that we kind of started this initiative in Europe and, over the last couple of years, have been aggressively<br>expanding our capabilities in the U.S. So we've added different marketing programs on top of that with some preventive maintenance programs<br>offerings. We've done some extended warranties on used equipment. So in essence, what we're doing is improving the capabilities of our dealers<br>so that it's -- so our end customers go to them for their parts, and so it's a good experience, and so that is showing dividends.<br>

<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Interesting. You mentioned used inventories in North America. The plan for this year is more work to do. Do you think based on what we can see<br>today, do you think -- and based on the retail environment that exists, do you think that issue is largely complete by the end of the year or is there<br>-- would there be maybe more wood to chop there?<br>
<b>Andrew H. Beck</b> - AGCO Corporation - Senior VP &amp; CFO<br>
Well, I think we'll be in a lot better shape by the end of the year. It's something that we will, I think, continue to look at in terms of -- from an<br>opportunistic standpoint. Having lower dealer inventories is a good thing from the standpoint, the equipment's fresher in the field, you don't have<br>as much aging or age discount issues, and it just makes you overall more efficient. And so from the standpoint of having our dealers feel comfortable<br>with their inventory levels, I think we'll be -- hopefully, in pretty good shape by the end of the year based on where the market may be recovering<br>a little as well as the actions we're taking to continue to reduce the absolute amount of inventory in the field. As we look into the future, I think<br>there'll probably be some areas where we think we can continue to turn the inventory faster in our field -- in our field inventory. And so I think,<br>again, that's more from a productivity, cost reduction standpoint that we'll look at doing that rather than something that our dealers are demanding.<br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Got it. Maybe the dealers in Brazil. I mean, you've talked about, for a number of years, the need to kind of strengthen and professionalize the dealer<br>base in Brazil. Just given the historic strong position for Massey in the southern parts of the country and more their production moves into the<br>center and northern parts of Brazil, what needs to be done there from here? And I guess, just what's a -- is it a -- do you think you have the product<br>there to compete when you do have the actual dealers in place?<br>
<b>Greg Peterson</b> - AGCO Corporation - Director of IR<br>
Sure. So it's some good questions there. So yes, the market in Brazil is very different. There's the -- and when you get to the different geographic<br>areas. And Central and Southern Brazil is where you have the more established dealer networks. And we're very happy with our distribution in<br>those areas. It's -- as you move further north into the Mato Grosso region where more of the bigger farms, the newer farms are, is where we're<br>working really hard to develop our distribution network there. The good news is that the competition is having to do the same thing. Because<br>that's where, over the last 5 to 10 years, you've seen the new land being put into production. So we have historically had a big advantage in Central<br>and Southern Brazil just because our brands and our distribution network had been in Brazil for decades, so the competition was kind of playing<br>catch-up in Central and Southern Brazil. In Northern Brazil, it's kind of the new frontier, and that's where all the new development's taking place.<br>So what we've had to do is sign up new dealers for those territories, and in a lot of cases, it -- we'll have a very strong dealer in another part of Brazil<br>that has indicated interest to expand into that region, and so we've gone in that direction in some instances. In other instances, it might be a car<br>dealer or another successful business person that said, &quot;Oh, I'd like to sell farm equipment in that region.&quot; So we've had success both with existing<br>dealers and with brand-new folks. And so we're working very hard to cover that area. It's important that they develop brick-and-mortar locations<br>so that they can sell and service the equipment. And just like in Europe and in North America, we're helping the dealers move up the technology<br>curve so that they're capable of selling and servicing the equipment. The other thing that's going on for us in Brazil in that part of the country is<br>that we're starting to look at jointly selling our 2 brands. So in Brazil, we have very strong positions, as you mentioned, with Massey Ferguson, but<br>also with our Valtra dealers, which have historically been a little stronger on the sugarcane side. So we have an opportunity in the Mato Grosso<br>region where we're kind of starting almost with a clean sheet of paper to do some joint marketing. So in some cases going forward, we'll see some<br>dealers that are going to sell both brands. So we're working, both with the exclusive dealer model, but then also testing that joint sales model. So<br>a lot of work is being done there. We're confident -- you mentioned, the other thing is having the right products in place to compete. And one of<br>the things that we've focused on in 2017 and will -- and continue to impact us into 2018 is the localization of the bigger tractor technology that<br>we're selling in the U.S. and in Europe. And so you saw, especially in the back half of the year, some of the costs in our South America region, some<br>of the costs associated with that in our margins were impacted as result of localizing a lot of that technology. And we'll continue to see that into<br>the first part of 2018. And then as we roll out those new models, we would expect -- and as we ramp up suppliers in Brazil, that's another key thing,<br>is to be successful and to really sell products in Brazil, you have to make them in Brazil to qualify for the FINAME financing that we talked about.<br>

So we're in the process of qualifying new suppliers. And so with that, there's some additional costs. We don't have yet the volume discounting that<br>we will when we get to scale. And the other thing is, in our factories, we're having to train employees on the new models that we're building. So<br>as we kind of get through this transitionary period, as we get into 2018, number one, we'll see, we think, better performance in the market. But<br>also as we move through the transitionary period, you should see our margins improve in Brazil in the back half of the year. So the first half of the<br>year will continue to be less than desirable margins. And then as we get into the back half, we would expect to see margin improvement. So a lot<br>for us going on in Brazil this year.<br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Okay. And obviously embedded in the guidance that you gave back then?<br>
<b>Greg Peterson</b> - AGCO Corporation - Director of IR<br>
Yes, yes.<br>
<b>Timothy Thein</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst<br>
Maybe just my last one is just on Europe overall. And again, and kind of somewhat in absence of real-time indicators, people tend to zero in on the<br>sentiment measures in Europe. And I think they're -- last month, it was at a 7 or 8-year high. And the discussion there and the feedback is that order<br>boards are starting to push out. So how do you weigh that -- balance that against a market outlook that's flat? I guess, it ultimately gets to the<br>legitimacy of that product.<br>
<b>Andrew H. Beck</b> - AGCO Corporation - Senior VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, I think confidence is good there. As you've mentioned, we have a good order board situation there. I think we go back to, again, the economics<br>of the customers and where they stand -- profitability of where they stand. Commodity prices are on their lower level on -- the grain farmers had<br>a very rough 2016, some are still kind of clawing their way back from that period. So some of them are still not in -- going to be in an aggressive<br>buying position at this point. But I would say that confidence is improving. Their harvests were better or expect to be better for the '17 harvest.<br>And so all those things are moving in the right direction. And we talked already about dairy, whereas there was a recovery, there is some concern<br>that the dairy market pricing will start to pull back a little because of higher production levels. And so those are the factors that I think kind of keep<br>us at more of a steady state rather than something that's going to have another step up. But certainly, as you say, the confidence is pretty good,<br>customers are ordering, dealers are in a good position right now. And so that market, we hope, will continue to drive earnings improvement for<br>us.<br>

improving results and performance and position BKD for future growth and success.<br>
<b>b. </b>Strategy is built on growing topline despite challenges faced in markets.<br>

45 days of qtr. vs. closing communities for 800 days during entire 1Q17.<br>

<b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies.<br>
<b>Jason Michael Plagman</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Associate<br>
This is Jason Plagman on for Brian. So Cindy, just -- I know you touched on this in your prepared comments, but can you just comment<br>on kind of your key areas of focus for the first -- your first 90 days in the CEO role then even 365 days kind of what are your top 2 or<br>3 priorities that you'll be spending the most time on?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
Thanks for the question. Our top priority is to turnaround our company performance. We're focused on winning locally. This was<br>very successful for us in the past, and we're confident that our new plans will work. We've already identified and started initiating<br>changes. We're holding ourselves accountable just like we know you will, not only to make the changes, but also to measure and<br>report on key operational metrics. We plan to execute on a wide range of initiatives to create long-term sustainable value for our<br>shareholders.<br>

<b>Jason Michael Plagman</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Associate<br>
And then, I think you mentioned ongoing discussions with your real estate partners. How are you thinking through that? And that<br>was big area of focus during strategic review process. Are you still working towards reducing the barriers related to those consent<br>processes?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
We are looking for win-win relationships with our REIT partners. We value those relationships.<br>
<b>Jason Michael Plagman</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Associate<br>
Okay. That makes sense. And then just on the numbers, I don't know if I missed it, but did you mention on your outlook for month<br>-- annual rent increases, both in-place and the improved mark-to-market place? How are you thinking about where rent increases<br>will shake out for 2018?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
So we didn't provide specific guidance for our rent increases, but we do expect to see normal in-place rent increases. And we expect<br>to see continued pressure on mark-to-market on our same-store communities.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question is from Joanna Gajuk from Bank of America.<br>
<b>Joanna Sylvia Gajuk</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
Cindy, congratulations. So actually, on the last question partially, because on the Slide 18, I guess, you talk about the expect -- margin<br>expansion in 2019. So should I read into this, so you're trying to say that, I guess, and your comments kind of suggested because<br>you said '18 will be a challenging year, so we should think about sort of not seeing margin expansion in 2018?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
That's correct. It will be a difficult year, but we expect to return to year-over-year growth in 2019.<br>
<b>Joanna Sylvia Gajuk</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
And did I hear it right, so you talk about the labor cost outlook for '18, 5.5% to 6%? So was it for the full year '17?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
We are close to 6% in the fourth quarter and over 5% for the full year. So if you think about 2018, we're expecting to see similar labor<br>growth and that is total compensation, including benefit on our same communities.<br>

<A name=178></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, BKD - Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Joanna Sylvia Gajuk</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
All right. And then, you also said that in also the -- one of the slides, talk about reducing or rather realigning how you spend your<br>CapEx, right? So you have this metric here when you kind of talk about, it seems the recurring CapEx or the community level CapEx.<br>So can you maybe flush out your view in terms of the different buckets for your total CapEx? Also Program Max and EBITDA, enhancing<br>CapEx and any piece of corporate versus recurring, how can you -- so how should we think about it for next year or maybe the next<br>couple of years in terms of changes versus Q4, for example?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
So Joanna, we're not giving formal guidance in this call, but what I can say with regard to our community level CapEx, on a same-store<br>basis, it's not going to be terribly different than 2017. We are expecting to increase our Program Max investments. And as you know,<br>we think Program Max is something that drives a lot of value for our shareholders. We normally see double-digit returns on those<br>projects and so we want to invest more there. I will also say that in 2018, we will have hurricane-related Capex as we finished cleaning<br>up the damage in Florida, primarily from the hurricanes that hit their last year and some extra onetime CapEx potentially to respond<br>to the new legislation that's in process for Florida generators.<br>
<b>Joanna Sylvia Gajuk</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
Right. So I guess, on that front, so you said it -- you plan to increase the Program Max because that's where you see the highest<br>returns. So what are the some of the examples of projects that you mentioned that you will try to, I guess, walk away from, so to<br>speak, or refocus this spending. So is it the cap exposure? Or is it something also that's could on the operating expenses? So any<br>kind of examples you can give us in terms of things you -- as of now, you decided to kind of reduce exposure because what I'm<br>getting at is, is there something where you kind of considering maybe reducing your Ancillary Services business at all?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
So let me take that question. I think there are a few questions in there. So first with regard to CapEx, we are not reducing the number<br>of CapEx projects we have by any mean. In fact, with Program Max, we're increasing the number of projects that we have underway,<br>but as you think about the impact of projects on the community, our objective is to reduce well-meaning initiatives that are impacting<br>our communities. So if you think about it, there has been numerous, numerous department-driven pilot projects that consume the<br>time of our community leaders. We have and will continue to eliminate many of these. Regarding streamlining, one example that<br>we significantly abbreviated was a 600-item questionnaire that previously each community had to complete. We're also improving<br>our decision rights. And so one of the focus areas that we have is we want our decisions to be as close to the customer as they can<br>be. So we're empowering our executive directors and that's something that's a pretty big focus for us. With regard to our Ancillary<br>Services business, we think that's a critical part of our business and we think that it provides a differentiation for our customers as<br>they're able to get additional care within the same company.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from Chad Vanacore from Stifel.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
So Cindy, you mentioned occupancy, you're in a difficult December, but also we look at occupancy, it had been up 40 basis points<br>sequentially in the fourth quarter. So how did that occupancy trend by month?<br>

<A name=179></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, BKD - Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
So we were up in October and November and then we were down in December. Now in December, there are 2 things that were<br>challenges for us: the first was it was an unseasonably harsh weather pattern and the second was that the flu season started much<br>earlier this year than it normally does. Normally, we don't see a flu impact until the first quarter, but we did see the flu hit our<br>communities in Q4, particularly in Northeast. Now as I've mentioned, when there is flu in a community, we basically close the<br>community. And we do that to protect our residents. We also do that to make sure that we're protecting everyone. So when that<br>happened, we can't give tours, we can't move new residents in and so because of that you have an impact on occupancy.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Right. And it seems like that occupancy is bleeding into the fourth quarter, and you had mentioned that the flu had really closed to<br>-- down for about 1,000 days in that first 45 days in a month. So how has -- how's that occupancy trended in January? Can you put<br>a number to it?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
I won't put a number to it, but what I will say is that in Q1, we normally experienced a seasonal decline. So Q1 is always, almost always<br>lower than sort of Q4 and 2018 is no different than that. As you did mention, we are having a flu impact. It's the worst flu season for<br>seniors as it's been in 20 years. And so that has an effect not only on our move-ins, but also in having an increased death rate.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
So to the best of your estimate, what would you say the actual flu impact is over, what would be normal seasonality?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
It's too soon to say. As far as we know, the flu impact hasn't peaked yet. It normally peaks about this time, but we're still seeing pretty<br>elevated path. When we get together on our next call, we'll be able to provide additional clarity on that for you.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
All right. Well, I guess, I will change gears a little bit. And then just thinking about the strategic review process, what were some of<br>the terms in that indicated offer that you mentioned that the board felt was unachievable or untenable?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
Lee, do you want to take that one?<br>
<b>Lee S. Wielansky</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - Independent Director<br>
As we said in our previous comments, the offer was $9 a share and...<br>

<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
All right. So really price basically?<br>
<b>Lee S. Wielansky</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - Independent Director<br>
Say it again.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
If it's -- if that was really the -- if price consideration was the -- was a stumbling block?<br>
<b>Lee S. Wielansky</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - Independent Director<br>
Yes.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
All right. And then, just one... Go ahead.<br>
<b>Lee S. Wielansky</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - Independent Director<br>
Just -- I mean, to comment -- I mean, we look at the net asset value of the company, and we felt like that for shareholders that it's --<br>it's worth a whole lot more than $9 per share.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
All right. Then just switching gears one more time. The G&amp;A cut that you expect to happen in 2018. You are looking at a run rate at<br>$25 million once fully enacted, when do you expect to get to that full run rate?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
So the $25 million is the impact for 2018. An annualized impact of that is over $30 million. And I will say that we've already taken a<br>large number of the actions this week, in fact. Just to remind our G&amp;A. Now a quick reminder, the $25 million is before normal cost<br>inflation and before normalized bonuses. Because we underperformed last year, we paid much lower than normal bonuses and our<br>expectation is that we will perform in 2018 and so we will pay normalized bonuses.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
All right. But to get $25 million, how should that trend through the year?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
You should expect to see most of the impact by Q2 and Q3, but you'll see a significant impact in the last part of Q1 as well.<br>

<A name=186></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, DNR - Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>a. </b>20% increase from realized price in 3Q17.<br><b>b. </b>Including impact of hedges, per barrel realized oil price increased 60% sequentially as combined revenues and commodity<br>
derivative settlements increased by $46m.<br>
<b>B. NYMEX Oil Differential:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Avg. realized oil prices relative to NYMEX prices.<br><b>2. </b>Oil price differential improved by over $2 per barrel from 3Q17, which (inaudible) equates to $11m uplift in revenues.<br><b>3. </b>Overall differential of $1.70 above NYMEX prices.<br>
<b>a. </b>Best differential Co. has realized since 2Q13.<br><b>b. </b>This improvement was generally related to expanding premium for life of Louisiana suite oil, which averaged over $5 per<br>
barrel above NYMEX prices in 4Q; tracking similarly to increase in Brent prices.<br>
<b>4. </b>Approx. two-thirds of production has LLS index component included in its price formula.<br><b>5. </b>Seen CCA and Rockies price differential improved to best level since Co. began operations there in 2010.<br><b>6. </b>LLS premium has pulled back significantly from recent highs and is trending in positive $2.00-2.50 range.<br>
<b>a. </b>Co. previously took advantage of the opportunity to lock in LLS to WTI basis swaps at avg. premium above $4 per barrel<br>
to 1H18 to capture a portion of this strong premium.<br>
<b>b. </b>With LLS premium trending down throughout 2018, expects that overall oil differential excluding hedges will also trend<br>
lower.<br>
<b>7. </b>Currently anticipates that overall differential for:<br>
<b>a. </b>1Q18 will be in positive $0.75-1.00.<br><b>b. </b>2Q18 through 4Q18 to be flat with NYMEX to positive $0.50.<br>
<b>C. Oil Price Hedges:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Since 3Q17 conference call, Co. added 2018 hedges covering 10,000 barrels per day of NYMEX and LLS fixed-price swaps.<br><b>2. </b>Hedges now represent approx. 65-70% of currently anticipated 2018 production levels.<br><b>3. </b>For 2019, Co. has begun to layer in combination of fixed-price swaps in 3-way collars.<br>
<b>a. </b>Initial hedging objectives for 2019 [would project] $55 and provide upside exposure to mid-60s with collars and project<br>
close to $60 with swaps.<br>
<b>4. </b>Plans to continue to add to 2019 hedges over the course of the year depending on market conditions.<br>
<b>D. Expenses:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>G&amp;A:<br>
<b>a. </b>G&amp;A expense $21m.<br>
<b>i. </b>Down 25% sequentially.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Lowest quarterly level in nine years.<br>
<b>b. </b>G&amp;A per BOE $3.64 per BOE.<br>
<b>i. </b>Lowest level Co. has had in quite some time.<br>
<b>c. </b>Beginning to reflect significant cost reductions implemented in 3Q.<br>
<b>d. </b>Net G&amp;A related to stock-based compensation approx. $3m.<br>
<b>e. </b>Expects 2018 to remain in lower $20m per qtr. with stock-based compensation representing roughly $3-5m of that amount.<br>
<b>2. </b>Net interest expense $23m.<br>
<b>a. </b>Slight increase from 3Q17 due to additional interest treated as debt, resulting from most recent debt exchange transactions.<br><b>b. </b>Currently expects capitalized interest to be $7-8m for qtr. throughout 2018.<br>
<b>3. </b>DD&amp;A expense $53m.<br>
<b>a. </b>Slight increase from 3Q17.<br><b>b. </b>Expects DD&amp;A expense to be $53-56m throughout 2018.<br>
<b>E. Tax &amp; Others:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Income taxes were significantly impacted from Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation enacted in Dec., which among other things<br>
lower the federal income tax rate for corporations from 35-21%.<br>
<b>2. </b>Since Co. is in net deferred tax liability position, this reduced Co.'s future tax liabilities resulting in $132m income tax benefit.<br>

<A name=187></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, DNR - Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>3. </b>Expects 2018 effective tax rate will be close to 25% with little or no cash taxes.<br><b>4. </b>Build 2018 budget around $55 oil price.<br>
<b>a. </b>Plans to keep spending within cash flow as Co. has historically done.<br><b>b. </b>On top, $300-325m of development capital, Co. estimates approx. $30m for capitalized interest, which brings total CapEx<br>
to $330-355m.<br>
<b>5. </b>Estimates 2018 cash flow from operations will be $430-480m, assuming:<br>
<b>a. </b>$55 WTI prices.<br><b>b. </b>$30m of interest being capitalized.<br>
<b>6. </b>Due to accounting for debt exchanges completed over last couple of years, roughly $90m of interest on debt will be shown<br>
in financial statements as reduction of debt instead of interest expense.<br>
<b>a. </b>To give accurate reflection of cash available to spend, Co. has subtracted this amount from estimated cash flow from<br>
operations bringing cash flow to adjusted range of $340-390m and giving Co. excess net cash of $10-35m.<br>
<b>7. </b>Excluding hedges, $5 change in oil price would impact cash flow by around $100m.<br>
<b>a. </b>Considering 2018 hedge positions:<br>
<b>i. </b>If prices averaged $50, would expect cash flow reduction of $50.<br>
<b>ii. </b>If prices averaged $60, would expect a gain of $30m in cash flow.<br>
<b>F. Balance Sheet:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Pro-forma for debt exchange transaction completed in early Jan.<br><b>2. </b>Total debt principal approx. $2.7b as of 12/31/17.<br>
<b>a. </b>$475m outstanding on bank credit facility.<br><b>b. </b>Over $500m of remaining borrowing base availability.<br>
<b>3. </b>Since oil price downturn that began in 2014, reduced debt principal by $836m.<br>
<b>a. </b>Earliest maturity of debt as bank facility which matures in Dec. 2019.<br>
<b>i. </b>Started initial conversations with lead bank regarding the extension of this facility in 2018.<br>
<b>b. </b>Main priority will be to retain ample liquidity full access to [$1.050b] borrowing base.<br>
<b>4. </b>Believes that value sustaining asset base and improving debt metrics gives DNR a much different debt profile than what is<br>
reflected in trailing 12-month leverage metrics.<br>
<b>5. </b>Trailing 12-month debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 6.5 times range.<br>
<b>a. </b>Co. sees this improving meaningfully throughout 2018 and 2019, assuming oil prices remain in $55-60 price range.<br>
<b>6. </b>Sees path for Co. to approach 3.5 times total leverage, given $60 oil price environment over next couple of years and with<br>
existing asset base.<br>
<b>7. </b>Based on current projections, expects outstanding bank debt to come down throughout 2018 to $300-400m, largely due<br>
to anticipated proceeds from Houston area land sales.<br>
<b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Tim Rezvan with Mizuho.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
I got a few here. I guess I'll start. The Cedar Creek Anticline EOR decision. Chris, you've repeatedly put out a first half '18 event. And<br>then the slide deck has language saying that the company's looking to establish a path forward. Given that we're at the end of<br>February here, the first half is only 4 more months, can you give any color on kind of where you stand or what you're pursuing? Or<br>how that possibly could look getting to FID there?<br>

<A name=188></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, DNR - Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Tim. So the way back I think about these, first of all, it's just such a great target upwards of 300 million barrels of potentially EOR<br>resource up there, which is well in excess of our total current proved reserve base. So it's something that you really want to chase<br>after. And what we're doing, even through the downturn, we've kept the permitting process, which is really the main time impact<br>on the whole project. We've kept that running through the downturn. And I think, what I see us heading towards is a confluence of<br>getting the permitting resolved to a point where we can proceed, and we're feeling pretty good about that in the first part of this<br>year. Getting the technical work and getting that piece of done, and that's every bit of that that I've seen as we've come through the<br>last couple of quarters, is starting to come to a head. Again, with this objective of getting that landed in the first half of this year. And<br>then, the project work and taking into account some of the learnings that we've picked up over the last few years and reducing --<br>optimizing the cost of our facilities and making a fit for purpose-type of development on the facility side. That's all coming together,<br>very focused on getting that decided the first half of this year. And then what I see is that would put us in a position to have the pipe,<br>which is a major single investment late in 2019, get injection started in '20 and then see first production in '21. So that's the framework<br>that we're seeing there, Tim. And I think that, at least everything I've seen so far, is very positive.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
Okay. Okay. So are you -- are there plans that you might -- that you may go ahead without really looking for a partner, some kind of<br>third-party capital infusion on the project?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
No. One piece that I didn't mention in my description there is that we're looking at how we fund that and some different options<br>there. Honestly, we'd prefer not to take the chunky capital of the pipeline in 1 year. We have a lot of other very nice projects we'd<br>like to do with that. And so part of the process we're working through the same time is exactly that, is looking at different paths for<br>bringing in some outside capital for doing that. And as you mentioned, that is a great type of business that, I think, people are<br>interested in investing in. And so that's something that will happen along the same time and to some degree, perhaps, even beyond<br>the first half of the year, but I don't see any risk associated with that.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
Okay. I appreciate all the color. And then, perhaps, this is a related topic. You talked about marketing some of your mature assets. It<br>looks like production a little over 7,000 a day on that. Was that a separate decision from possible funding CCA? Or others kind of --<br>do you see those as integrated decisions?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
I see them as separate decisions, Tim. That really -- looking at our portfolio is something that we should be doing every quarter, every<br>year, and making sure that our portfolio makes the most sense for our priorities and where we want to deploy our capital and,<br>honestly, just our focus. So they are separate, but I do see that at the end of the day, we're -- there's going to be a question of proceeds<br>from that sale, what are you going to do with those? And we're very open with where that'd be deployed, whether it's into reducing<br>debt, into the assets and something like CCA or doing something else with it. But that is a possibility, but they were arrived at<br>separately really just makes sense for us to look at these assets and get our portfolio as optimized as we can.<br>

<A name=189></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, DNR - Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
Okay. Okay. If I could switch, and this may be a better question for Mark. The 4Q '17, the unit expense profile was very strong. But if<br>-- I can understand it from the prepared comments, you expect LOE to up to about $0.50. Should we think about that as $0.50 from<br>the full year 2017 average, which gets us closer to kind of a 21 level? Or is that from the 4Q '17 kind of level?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
I think of it, Tim -- this Chris again, from the full year average. We see it landing around there. Obviously, there's a lot to be gained<br>from continued focus at the field level on what we can do to improve that, and we're continuing to work other paths to improving<br>it. Honestly, optimizing our portfolio will do that to some degree, growing our production will do it to another back. But to frame<br>that, I think, you're right looking at the full year.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
Okay. Okay. And then, I guess, just one final one. It sounds like the Houston real estate sale it may not be one package but it could<br>be multiple packages. So is that something that we should maybe just we'll get in like little pieces throughout 2018? Is that how<br>should we think about that?<br>
<b>Mark C. Allen</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary<br>
So what -- the way we think about the real estate sale in Houston, Tim, is 2 distinct parts. First, the area in Conroe there that's near<br>The Woodlands, south of the town of Conroe. And that is one main parcel or one main piece of real estate that's broken up into 7<br>parcels. And all of those parcels are going out for an RFP on March 1 of this year. So just a couple of weeks from now. And we expect<br>to have bids in that by the end of March and see some notional -- we expect to get some purchase and sale agreements executed<br>in the second quarter. So that's something that, I think, you'd see something from us in the second quarter. Then as we move south<br>to Webster, that this multiple different parcels. Just the nature of their real estate there along the frontage road, on I-45 going down<br>to Galveston, there are many different nice things we can do with the -- with that property and that will be something that I think<br>you'll see starting to come in over the course of '18, and might even be beyond that. But there's a lot of interest, a lot of good things<br>happening there. Kind of 2 different things. A big piece in Conroe that we'll see some numbers on in the second quarter and then<br>the rest of it in Webster that will happen throughout the year here.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we do have a question from the line of Tarek Hamid from JPMorgan.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
This is actually Kevin Quan calling in for Tarek. Just on Mission Canyon, I understand that it's slightly in early stages, but I just wanted<br>to gauge expectations and sort of any change in geology for your 2 additional wells kind of to the North and South of your initial<br>pilot well there and any other detail would be helpful.<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
So Kevin, what we'd say about Mission Canyon. First of all, it's early days. So we have 1 well that's been producing for really less than<br>2 months now. Certainly, we're pleased with what we've seen. We want to get more time with the well that we've drilled. We want<br>

to get more wells drilled and get some production history behind there. If you look at the map that we've provided for the Mission<br>Canyon area that we're drilling right now, as I mentioned, we've already spudded the second well on that same structure. And we<br>really don't see anything different that we expect in the next 2 wells in terms of where we are geologically and what we're looking<br>for. It's more of just testing the same concept and the same accumulation and establishing some production history. As we move<br>outside of the Pennel and Coral Creek area, which is one of these first wells will be, then there're some different ideas that we're<br>going to be testing, but again, all of it is generally the same concept with this fairly narrow interval of Mission Canyon. It's very<br>productive, and we have some good running room across the CCA area with it.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Okay. That's quite helpful. And I assume that a lot of the other -- the remaining -- the total 24 locations that you have, that's for the<br>remaining sort of (inaudible) Creek area and [Little Beaver] and the other regions or are they...<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Exactly. Kevin, if you across the inset map we have there, we have the initial wells in the Pennel, Coral area and then we have those<br>red ovals highlighting some other opportunities that we see in our leaseholds that are outside of those fields.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Okay. Got it. And on Slide 17 you kind of -- I'm just hopping back to your capital plan. I just wanted to see the cadence of your capital<br>projects throughout the year. I know you list quite a few tertiary and non-tertiary ones there. I'm just trying to see how lumpy it<br>might be towards the end of the year, et cetera?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
I -- just off the top of my head. I don't think that there's any particular jump or drop in capital as we go through the course of the<br>year. The exploitation piece is working now and will continue. The Bell Creek Phase 6 piece is working now and will continue<br>throughout the year. So I see it being fairly flat as we move across the year.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Okay, that's fair. And then, along those same lines, the mature areas -- fields that you mentioned that you're looking at marketing.<br>Just wanted to get any detail on those particular assets in the sense of what interest look like. I know, again, it's probably early days<br>as well, but just trying to get a gauge on how soon that might happen.<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
So that's something that -- we don't want to share too much of our thinking around that. We can share why we're making this move<br>but our expectations, and so on, we want to let the process work. But it is something that we expect to kick off fairly soon here, and<br>we'll see a -- we'll see that out in the public within the next few days actually looking to close it by the end of the second quarter.<br>

<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Okay. That's helpful. My last one too, quickly on your revolver. I just wanted to see what your expectations on potential refinancing<br>might be, given your improvement in reserve base?<br>
<b>Mark C. Allen</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary<br>
Yes. This is Mark. Yes. As I mentioned, we're starting to work with our lead bank, JPMorgan, and the bank group in terms of extending<br>that out. We think there's numerous possibilities and, I think, the one thing that really -- and I said before, that differentiates us is<br>just our assets and they're sustaining value. Yes our leverage metrics have been higher than we would like and we're starting to see<br>those move here in the right direction. With cost reductions and prices, which is, I think one very positive sign and I think over the<br>last few years, our bank group has continued to work with us quite well and we just -- we're confident in how we're going to move<br>forward here.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we do have a question from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.<br>
<b>Charles Arthur Meade</b> - Johnson Rice &amp; Company, L.L.C., Research Division - Analyst<br>
Sorry for asking again about these Mission Canyon wells, but, I guess, when you make 1,000 barrel a day well for whatever, $3.6<br>million, people want to know more about it. I'm curious if you can talk about what the, what kind of decline profile you're seeing<br>and you expect to see in this well? When I just look at your current EOR and the rate, the way those 2 fit together make it seem like<br>it's a pretty high decline well. But I wanted to just test that because we've gotten to the point -- we've answered the question about<br>or maybe addressed the question of how repeatable that is, but also how good is this? So can you talk about how -- what you're<br>seeing in 2 months of decline on this?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
You bet. So what I'd say, Charles, is that first of all, that the EOR that you had seen that we disclosed publically was a predrill expectation<br>so there's going to be some adjustment to that as we go. I would still say it's early days on how this behaves. But if you think about<br>just the nature of putting a long lateral in a pretty thin reservoir, we'd expect it to behave, honestly, more like an unconventional<br>well where you have some fairly high initial decline rates. We're going to keep watching that. We're not to the point where we have<br>enough of a track record out here with it to really talk in too much detail. But what I would say, look at it to be along the lines of what<br>you'd expect more in the unconventional side with the benefit of these wells being that we are completing open hole without of<br>frac and the cost associated with that.<br>
<b>Charles Arthur Meade</b> - Johnson Rice &amp; Company, L.L.C., Research Division - Analyst<br>
That's helpful insight, Chris. Thank you. If I could ask also about -- if you could talk a bit more about the exploitation you're doing at<br>Tinsley and this Parise Sand. Did I hear you right that is one of the traditional field pays that's maybe under CO2 flood in different<br>parts of the field? And are you guys planning on going at this with a being frac? Or what's your plan of attack?<br>

<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes. So what's interesting about that and it's even -- it even applies back to the Mission Canyon, Charles, is that these -- certain of<br>these reservoirs, when we produce them on primary, when that's complete, they set themselves up very nicely for CO2. And that's<br>the case with Mission Canyon, and that'll be the same for Perry. With the Perry, it's an area of the Tinsley Field that we don't have<br>perm for traditional vertical wells to really do a great job of sweeping with EOR so we have a lot of residual oil left in that horizon.<br>And that's why we're going to attack this one with the horizontals again. We are going to have to put a bit of a frac in these, we think,<br>to get the rates that we want. So it'll be a little different, although just if you kind of balance the whole nature of the -- of that field<br>and the depth of the reservoir, our well costs are going to be in the same ballpark as what you saw with Mission Canyon.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we do have a question from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities.<br>
<b>Richard Merlin Tullis</b> - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production<br>
Just a couple of questions here, Chris. Going back to the potential sale of the mature properties. It sounds like if you're expecting<br>possibly to have some news in the second quarter, things, I guess, are moving along. Is this more of a package to one party? Or would<br>you expect to break it up? Have you received inbound interest on this that kind of started things off?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
There is definitely some interest in it, Richard. When we look at how the package is set up, it's actually in 2 separate packages that<br>are more geographically aligned. We think there's interest, but it's something that I don't see going to 9 different sellers but we<br>would like to keep it in those 2 packages. But like with all of these processes, you had kind of need to see what the interest is and<br>how that shapes up.<br>
<b>Richard Merlin Tullis</b> - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production<br>
Not that you're borrowing much against your borrowing base, but what would the expected impact be to the base and to reserves<br>if you were to sell the whole package with the associated roughly 7,000 barrels a day?<br>
<b>Mark C. Allen</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary<br>
Yes, Richard, it's Mark. Yes, we'll need to work through that with the banks. It could be at a level that we'll need to get their permission,<br>but it's kind of marginal at that point so...<br>
<b>Richard Merlin Tullis</b> - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production<br>
Okay. Okay. And Mark, I know you also talked about potentially moving the leverage ratio down into the 3.5x level over a period of<br>years. What levers do you have to pull at this point beyond, say, oil price-related, what's up next?<br>
<b>Mark C. Allen</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary<br>
Yes. Well, I think we've done a lot of things over the last couple of years. Obviously, we've hit on cost reductions. We've done some<br>exchanges, utilizing our capital structure and the flexibility that it has provided. I think we still have some flexibility remaining there.<br>

We have some new instruments in the last exchanges in the form of converts, which could provide some optionality, and we'd like<br>to see those convert here at some point. But we still think what really drives our ability forward here is obviously, we're doing a lot<br>of great things on our operations side, we have some new projects, but more than that is really just getting back to the sustaining<br>nature of our reserves and the fact that our reserve basis is very desirable, it doesn't deplete rapidly over time. And so when people<br>look at that from an investment standpoint, they appreciate that, and it has a totally different profile. So all those things combined,<br>I'd say, still give us a lot of flexibility and ways to think about continuing to improve our balance sheet over time, Richard.<br>
<b>Richard Merlin Tullis</b> - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production<br>
That's helpful. And just lastly for me. Did you provide a range of expected proceeds for Houston land sale? Or maybe asked another<br>way, have you had an appraisal done on the properties? Or that you could share with us?<br>
<b>Mark C. Allen</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary<br>
When we rolled this out, Richard, last year, we talked about it covering off basically our Salt Creek acquisition, which is in the low<br>$70 million range. And I would say since that point in time, we obviously continued to expand our thinking and yes, we're working<br>with brokers who are marketing this and have some values in mind. And so we're very cautious to get into much beyond what we've<br>said, but we've continued to become more encouraged over time and determine what could that be.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) It looks like we have a follow-up question from the line of Tim Rezvan with Mizuho.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
Just a couple of quick follow-ups from me. Can you disclose what the P&amp;A liabilities would be on this mature asset?<br>
<b>Mark C. Allen</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary<br>
Yes. At this point, I don't think we want to get into too much of the specifics around that. If we -- as we go forward, and we get to<br>talk about the potential sale or the -- get bids and stuff, then we'll give more clarity around that.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
Okay. It was worth a shot, I guess. And then, a second. You've talked a lot about Bell Creek Phase 5 expansion and Phase 6 coming<br>in this year. From a modeling point of view, how should we think about kind of where -- at what level and kind of when we could<br>see sort of production peak from that field? I mean, how do -- what assumptions do you all have for 2018 baked in, kind of the<br>corporate production guidance?<br>
<b>Christian S. Kendall</b> - Denbury Resources Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Tim, I'll take that. The first thing I'd say about Bell Creek, and you might have noticed it on our production table, is that without<br>contribution from Phase 5, we still reached a new EOR record in the fourth quarter there, and our teams have just done a superb job<br>of working through the -- Phases 1 through 4 with -- and optimizing our production there. Did some creative nice work to continue<br>to grow production from the initial phases. Then Phase 5, we expect to start to see the response. We actually have it completed, as<br>

I mentioned, and we're injecting, and we have the initial response, which is, essentially, water production that's very strong. It looks<br>good to us. We're optimistic about how it's going to respond with oil. We expect to see that midyear. Not really ready to talk about<br>the volumes that we expect, but I think that what you've seen in our overall guide represents probably a conservative view of what<br>we think about that. And then, of course, Phase 6, we're following right beyond Phase 5 so that will be executed through the course<br>of this year with response expected in 2019. So I think our peak on Bell Creek is still a few years away, Tim.<br>
<b>Timothy A. Rezvan</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research<br>
So 2019 will be the year we could see the potential step change increase?<br>

Yes. I think you'll see a step change that will begin in 2018 with the Phase 5 response and that will continue on with the Phase 6 in<br>'19.<br>

Good afternoon. Welcome to Zix' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew, and I'll be your operator this<br>afternoon.<br>
Joining us for today's presentation are the company's President and CEO, David Wagner; CFO, David Rockvam; and Vice President of Marketing,<br>Geoff Bibby. Following their remarks, we will open the call for your questions.<br>
I would like to remind everyone that this call will be recorded and made available for replay via a link in the Investor Relations section of the<br>company's website.<br>
Now I would like to turn the call over to Geoff Bibby. Sir, please proceed.<br>
<b>Geoffrey R. Bibby</b> - Zix Corporation - VP of Marketing<br>
Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call. With me<br>today is our CEO, Dave Wagner; and our CFO, Dave Rockvam. After the market close, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth<br>quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017, a copy of which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.zixcorp.com.<br>
Please note that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance<br>of the company. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from<br>those in the forward-looking statements. It's important to note that the company undertakes no obligation to update such statements.<br>
We caution you to consider risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements contained<br>in today's press release and in this conference call. The Risk Factors section in our most recent Form 10-K filing with the SEC provides examples of<br>those risks.<br>
During the call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in<br>isolation from, a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage you to consider all measures when analyzing the company's<br>performance. A reconciliation of certain GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release, which can be found, as I said, in the<br>Investor Relations section of our site.<br>
Now with that, I would like to turn the call over to Dave Wagner for his opening remarks. Dave?<br>

<A name=198></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ZIXI - Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>David J. Wagner</b> - Zix Corporation - CEO, President and Director<br>
Thank you, Geoff. Good afternoon and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We finished 2017 with a strong financial performance, delivering<br>on our commitment to profitable growth. We grew revenue in 2017 by 9%, adjusted EBITDA by 8% and cash flow from operations by 19% to $18.2<br>million.<br>
The successful introduction of ZixProtect and ZixArchive and our cloud-based e-mail protection bundle contributed to these strong results, and<br>we are pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the market for these solutions.<br>
The fourth quarter delivered an acceleration of the trends that we've been seeing with our customers moving to the cloud and often preferring a<br>bundled offering. New first-year orders from ZixProtect more than doubled sequentially, while new first year orders from ZixArchive more than<br>quadrupled over the same period. These new solutions are increasingly being delivered as an e-mail protection bundle, enabling us to attract new<br>customers, and to sell deeper into our installed base.<br>
Quarter-over-quarter, our attach rates for ZixProtect more than doubled to almost 3%, and new first year orders of ZixProtect and ZixArchive<br>accounted for over 20% of our total new first year orders in the quarter.<br>
These results demonstrate our ability to successfully execute on our cross-selling initiatives and validate our strategy of transitioning to a broader<br>e-mail security provider from our strength as a leader in encryption. In a market environment that's being driven by the migration of e-mail to the<br>cloud and, at the same time, that is being targeted by hackers as the #1 threat vector, customers are searching for an e-mail protection solution<br>like Zix that assures security and compliance in a cloud-based easy-to-use service with outstanding customer support.<br>
We are building the Zix brand and our core strengths to become one of the clear choices for a robust and fully-featured email security bundle.<br>We're still in the early stages of executing our bundling strategy, but the results are beginning to speak for themselves.<br>
Let me step back for a moment though. 2017 was about more than just launching our bundled solutions to address a significantly larger total<br>addressable market. It was also about refining who Zix is and, more importantly, what Zix can be. Leveraging more than 2 decades of market<br>leadership and expertise in the e-mail encryption space, we've successfully expanded our horizon from just e-mail encryption to become one of<br>the preeminent providers for a broader set of e-mail security solutions.<br>
Our rebranding at the beginning of the year laid the foundation for our new identify and reaffirmed our commitment to our customers. We created<br>our customer success team to better serve our customers throughout all stages of their Zix relationship, ensuring that we deliver even more value<br>to our customers. Embracing this philosophy of driving more value, we then launched ZixProtect and ZixArchive, significantly expanding our<br>product suite. Along the way, we bolstered our leadership team, enhanced our e-mail encryption capabilities with the acquisition of EMS, and<br>made significant enhancements to our platform, especially our multitenant cloud solution, which grew 87% year-over-year during the quarter.<br>
With all of these accomplishments, our accelerating momentum with ZixProtect and ZixArchive served as the cherry on top, helping us to end<br>2017 on a high note.<br>
Looking ahead to the new fiscal year, we look forward to extending the 87% year-over-year revenue growth we experienced last year in our<br>cloud-based encryption product as well as the opportunity to accelerate that success with ZixProtect and ZixArchive.<br>
However, the excess churn due to M&amp;A and competitive pressure is slowing our near-term revenue growth and impacting our 2018 guidance. This<br>excess competitive churn we are experiencing is primarily from our on-premise appliance customers, which now represents about 20% of our ACV,<br>down from 27% of our ACV a year ago.<br>
We believe the success we're seeing with our cloud-based e-mail security solutions position us well for expanding our market position and building<br>a foundation for stronger levels of growth and profitability moving forward. Later on today's call, I'll expand on how we're making real progress to<br>mitigate and overcome some of these pressures.<br>

<A name=199></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ZIXI - Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call<br>
But first, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Dave Rockvam, to provide more details on the financials for the quarter and the year. Dave?<br>
<b>David E. Rockvam</b> - Zix Corporation - CFO and VP<br>
Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Building on Dave's remarks, Q4 was another strong quarter with regards to our bundling,<br>cross-selling initiatives and moving our customers to the cloud. As ZixProtect and ZixArchive continued to gain traction, we believe we're in solid<br>position to expand our market share in the broader e-mail data protection space.<br>
Turning to our financial numbers in more detail. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 8% to $16.8 million from $15.6 million in the same quarter<br>last year. Our Q4 revenue came in at the high-end of our revenue guidance range and also represented our highest level of quarterly revenue for<br>the 15th quarter in a row. The record revenue was primarily driven by the rapid adoption of our cloud-based hosted encryption solution and the<br>success of our new e-mail protection bundled offerings. We did also benefit from a partner-based account becoming current and some compliance<br>revenue, which together contributed roughly $200,000 in Q4 revenue.<br>
Looking at fiscal 2017, revenue increased 9% to a record $65.7 million from $60.1 million in the same period last year. 9% growth from 2017 continues<br>to demonstrate our solid subscription business performance and customer momentum. Our new first year orders for the quarter decreased 7% to<br>$2.5 million compared to $2.7 million in the same quarter last year. As David alluded to earlier, new first-year order were up 119% sequentially for<br>ZixProtect, and up 323% sequentially for ZixArchive. While new first year orders as a whole were down year-over-year, we are pleased to see our<br>cloud-based hosted solution and our bundled offerings making up a bigger percentage of this metric and the new customer wins.<br>
Our adjusted gross profit for the quarter was $13.7 million or 81.4% of total revenue, which is an improvement on a dollar basis from $12.9 million<br>or 82.7% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016. 81.4% was at the high-end of our adjusted gross margin outlook of 80% to 81%, which we<br>provided last quarter. Similar to the prior 2 quarters, our adjusted gross margin percentage for Q4 was down year-over-year. This is because we<br>included a 100% of Greenview Data's cost while not yet capturing 100% of their revenue, which is expected when purchasing a subscription-based<br>revenue company. We continue to expect our adjusted gross margins to remain within this range of 80% to 82% in 2018, as we continue to invest<br>to provide best-in-class customer support and operational excellence.<br>
For the full year, adjusted gross profit was $53.5 million or 81.5% of total revenue, which was an improvement on a dollar basis from $49.8 million<br>or 82.8% of total revenue in 2016. Our adjusted R&amp;D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.7 million or 16.2% of total revenue compared<br>to $2.4 million or 15.4% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Greenview<br>data in our results versus their absence a year ago. The R&amp;D headcount increase accounts for 100% of the overall increase in R&amp;D as a percentage<br>of sales.<br>
Later in the call, Dave will dive into the exciting advancements to our platform the team has been delivering.<br>
Our adjusted selling and marketing expenses for the quarter were $4.5 million or 26.9% of total revenue compared to $4.7 million or 30.4% of total<br>revenue in Q4 of last year. A portion of the decrease in dollars was due to the cost-cutting measures we took in Q4 to better align cost and sales<br>opportunities in 2018. The decrease in selling and marketing as a percentage of sales was primarily, however, due to the increase in revenues for<br>the year.<br>
For the fourth quarter of 2017, our adjusted general and administrative expenses were $2.3 million or 13.6% of total revenue compared to $1.9<br>million or 12.3% of total revenue reported in Q4 of last year. Similar to the prior quarter, the year-over-year increase was primarily due to the addition<br>of a VP of Corporate Development, our investment in new systems to modernize our business processes and the addition of our Ann Arbor office.<br>The systems upgrade project went live on January 5, and we're starting to see immediate benefits from this upgrade. As we've communicated<br>before, these investments are foundational to our plan to grow the company via our build, partner, buy strategy. Due to the 2017 tax reform<br>legislation which reduces our corporate tax rate as of January 1, 2018, we had to make a one-time adjustment of $12.5 million to our deferred tax<br>asset balance during the fourth quarter. This adjustment was made to reflect the future effect of the lowering the corporate tax income tax rate<br>from 35% to 21%. In combination with those adjustment and other deferred tax expense, we recognized a net non-cash charge of $15.2 million<br>to our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter and $18.5 million for the full year. It's important to note, however, there's no change to our cash<br>

position or adjusted net income. We also don't expect this remeasurement to impact us going forward, and we believe we're still in a good position<br>to utilize our NOLs through the late 2020s.<br>
On a GAAP basis, we recorded a net loss of $12.9 million or $0.24 per fully diluted share compared to a GAAP net income of $1.9 million or $0.04<br>per diluted share in Q4 of last year. For the full year, GAAP net loss targeted -- totaled $8.1 million or $0.15 per diluted share compared to a GAAP<br>net income of $5.8 million or $0.11 per fully diluted share in 2016. The decrease for both the quarter and year was largely due to the one-time<br>non-cash charge of $12.5 million that I mentioned earlier.<br>
Our fourth quarter non-GAAP adjusted net income was $4.5 million or $0.08 per fully diluted share. $0.08 per share was consistent with our guidance<br>for the quarter, and represents an improvement of $0.01 over the amount we reported in Q4 of last year.<br>
For the full year, non-GAAP adjusted net income was $15.6 million or $0.29 per diluted share. $0.29 per share exceeds our 2017 guidance for<br>non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share, and represents a 12% improvement over the amount we reported in 2016.<br>
And finally, our adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2017 totaled $4.9 million, an increase of 8% compared to the $4.5 million we reported in Q4 of last year. As<br>a percentage of total revenue, adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was 29%, which was consistent with the same quarter last year, and above the previous<br>guidance that we would end the year at 28%.<br>
For the full year, our adjusted EBITDA was $18.2 million, up 8% from 2016 and matching last year's 28% of revenue. Cash flow from operations for<br>the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.2 million, up 108% from $2 million we reported in the same quarter last year. For the full year, we generated<br>$18.2 million of operating cash flow, up $2.9 million or 19% from 2016. As a profitable growth company, we're focused on building on this strong<br>cash flow generation, which is made possible due to the 100% subscription nature of our business. Because of our ability to consistently generate<br>this strong cash flow, we maintained our robust balance sheet with $33 million in cash and no debt.<br>
During the quarter, we also reached a licensing agreement settlement with respect to the IP infringement litigation, which should help free up<br>even more cash flow going forward.<br>
Turning to our share repurchase program, which the Board of Directors approved in April 2017. During Q4, we repurchased 500,000 shares for an<br>aggregate amount of $2.5 million, at an average share price of $4.95. Under the current program, we are authorized to purchase an additional $6.2<br>million worth of shares as of January 1, 2018, subject to certain conditions. Along with the Board, we continue to evaluate the shareholder return<br>of buybacks as part of our balanced capital allocation strategy, which we believe should drive higher returns for shareholders, both now and in<br>the future. I will add, we have repurchased shares in January and February of this year.<br>
CapEx for the quarter was $1.3 million, which included costs associated with our business systems implementation project and normal business<br>capital purchases. We expect CapEx for 2018 to be between $2.3 million and $2.7 million, and we expect to have approximately $2.7 million of<br>depreciation in 2018.<br>
Our backlog, which represents the dollar value of committed contracts, was $72.6 million as of December 31, 2017, which was down 11% from<br>$81.7 million as of the same date last year. The decrease in backlog in total orders was due to a decrease in our renewal rate from last year's record<br>levels as well as the shorter-term commitment associated with the new customer pricing in bundled offerings. As we've mentioned before, we are<br>reducing the financial incentives for customers to select longer-term contracts, which helps us increase our transaction volume and future touch<br>points with these customers.<br>
Looking at our deferred revenue, we expect to recognize approximately $45.1 million or 62.2% as revenue over the next 12 months. Similar to the<br>prior 2 quarters, you can see the impact of the shift toward shorter-term contracts when you compare the 62.2% of revenue recognition of deferred<br>over the next 12 months to last year's 57.3%. In other words, the 12-month backlog was up 5% year-over-year.<br>

<hr>
<A name=201></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ZIXI - Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call<br>
At the end of the fourth quarter, our ACV, or annual contract value, totaled $67.3 million, up 9% from Q4 of last year. From an industry perspective,<br>our revenue breakdown was 50% from health care, 28% from financial services, 7% from government and 15% from other verticals, all excluding<br>2017 acquisitions.<br>
Before shifting gears to our financial outlook, I would like to touch on the new accounting standard, revenue from contracts with customers, ASC<br>606, which were adopted at the start of the fiscal year starting January 1, 2018. The guidance on today's call and all future calls will conform to the<br>new ASC 606 accounting standard. While we are still in the final stages of assessing the impact, our current work would suggest that for the full<br>year 2018, the new standard will not have any impact on revenue, as Zix has recognized revenue for a number of years as a subscription, which is<br>in compliance with ASC 606. In terms of operating expenses, we expect ASC 606 to have a favorable impact to sales and marketing expense of<br>approximately $1.5 million to $2 million for 2018 as we start to amortize commissions of both new and add-on business over the average length<br>of customer life.<br>
The result of this change will be lower sales and marketing expenses in current periods by shifting that expense into future periods. And note that<br>the new standard has no impact on the calculation and reporting of cash flow. Zix plans to adopt ASC 606 under the modified retrospective standard,<br>and as such, we do plan to publish the details regarding historical impact of this new standard as part of our 10-Q that will be filed in connection<br>with our first fiscal quarter of 2018 reporting period.<br>
Now for our first quarter and full year 2018 financial guidance. We currently anticipate revenue for the first quarter to range between $16.6 million<br>and $16.8 million, representing an increase of 4% to 6% compared to Q1 of last year. We are also forecasting fully diluted GAAP earnings per share<br>to be between $0.04 and $0.05, and fully diluted non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share to be $0.08. For the full year, we expect revenue to range<br>between $67.5 million and $69 million, which represents an increase of 3% to 5% compared to revenue in fiscal 2017.<br>
We are also forecasting our fully diluted GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.17 and $0.19, and our fully diluted non-GAAP adjusted earnings<br>per share to be $0.32 for fiscal 2018.<br>
With the impact of ASC 606, we are targeting a 2018 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 30% versus 28% in 2016 and 2017.<br>
Our full year revenue guidance reflects the excess churn we experienced in 2017, and the roll-forward impact it is having on our 2018 revenue. As<br>we have not fully cleared through all the additional churn in our on-premise appliance customers, our 2018 growth rate is somewhat dampened.<br>However, we continue to be optimistic on our growth potential as we migrate and drive growth from new customers in our hosted and bundled<br>offerings. Both of these solutions performed extremely strong in 2017, and have us excited about the future as we continue to execute on our<br>profitable growth plan.<br>
This completes my financial summary. For a more detailed analysis of our financial results, please reference our Form 10-K, which we plan to file<br>by March 12th. Dave?<br>
<b>David J. Wagner</b> - Zix Corporation - CEO, President and Director<br>
Thank you for the financial overview, Dave. Beginning with this call, we are changing our reporting framework to focus on 3 main growth drivers<br>that more concisely consolidate the 7 pillars we've been using for the past 7 quarters. The 3 growth areas are one, new customer acquisition; two,<br>sales to existing customers through adding on and cross-selling; and three, reducing churn and increasing retention.<br>
I'll now spend the remainder of the call going over our financial performance and progress with respect to each of these 3 growth areas.<br>
In terms of new customer acquisition, we're continuing to secure new customers through our direct sales teams, VARs and MSPs and OEM partners.<br>In the first area, we'll also cover international customer acquisition efforts.<br>
So new customer acquisitions was previously addressed by pillars 1, 2 and 7. Our primary measure of new customer acquisition is through our new<br>first-year orders metric. As Dave mentioned earlier, our new first year orders for the quarter were $2.5 million. Although down 7% from the same<br>

quarter last year, this healthy level of new first year orders was once again driven by our success in winning new customers versus the competition,<br>particularly with our cloud-based solutions.<br>
In fact, 89% of our direct ZixEncrypt deployment in 2017 were hosted, this was up from 67% in 2016, 42% in 2015, and 9% in 2014, demonstrating<br>the rapid adoption of our cloud-based encryption product. This cloud adoption is especially important as it is where we can best attach additional<br>services and it is where our retention rates are the highest.<br>
As previously mentioned, a key part of our sales success in Q4 was the increasing momentum of ZixProtect and ZixArchive. New first year orders<br>for these products more than doubled and quadrupled respectively on a sequential basis. As a percentage of total new first year orders, ZixProtect<br>and ZixArchive accounted for more than 20% of the $2.5 million compared to 17% of the $2.1 million in Q3.<br>
In terms of our core encryption product, we did see a year-over-year decline due to reduced contribution from our OEM partners and the changes<br>we made to our pricing and bundling strategy.<br>
Looking more specifically at new first year orders from new customers, $1.3 million or 54% of our new first year orders in Q4 came from new<br>customers. 3 of our top 5 new customer wins during the quarter were for our core ZixEncrypt best-of-breed solution, demonstrating that customers<br>continued to value our core encryption solution. Of course, that means 2 of our top 5 new customers in the quarter were for our bundle. We're<br>especially pleased with this traction and the fact that we displaced key Gartner Magic Quadrant providers in these accounts, demonstrating the<br>strength of our bundle in competitive displacement scenarios.<br>
Taking a step back and analyzing our new first year orders during the quarter, 52% came from our direct sales efforts; 41% through VARs and MSPs;<br>5% through our OEM partners; and 2% from web sales. Only 5% from our OEM partners means that we experienced another light contribution<br>from that channel. With regards to Cisco, we're still not in a position where we can expect consistent new first-year order contributions from them<br>as a channel and we're working with Cisco to find a new and fresh approach to optimize our work together. With Google, we continued to move<br>opportunistically, and see a stronger opportunity to engage Gmail, G Suite customers through Google's channel partners, [then] with Google's<br>direct sales force.<br>
For the full year of 2017, new first-year orders from our OEM partners decreased to 9% of our new first year orders from 17% in 2016, more than<br>accounting for the year-over-year decline in the total new first year orders and the majority of the year-over-year decline in encryption orders.<br>
In 2018, we will be continuing to work with our existing OEM partners to optimize our work together, but we will be placing increasing emphasis<br>on our MSP and VAR routes-to-market as we believe that they represent a better go-to-market fit for our expanded solutions set.<br>
More specifically, on April 2, we will launch a new managed service provider program that will allow our MSP partners to access our complete<br>bundle from a single interface, including the ability for tiered access to ZixCentral and self-administration of their end users. We are also introducing<br>monthly billing for our MSP partners that move to the new expanded offering. We're excited about the strong early reception of this new offering<br>by the partners who are previewing it, and we're optimistic about the potential increase to our business, particularly in the SUB 50 mailbox space<br>and Gmail space that had been historically underrepresented in our base.<br>
Turning quickly to our progress on the international front. On our last call, we talked about penetrating the Canadian market through our acquisition<br>of EMS, which helped us secure 3 of Canada's largest banks. Our on-premise and S/MIME capabilities have been particularly effective in this regard,<br>and we look to leverage these capabilities to expand our business outside the U.S.<br>
Last, but not least, we also signed a distribution agreement and our first reseller in the United Kingdom as we look to take advantage of the growth<br>opportunities in this market with the rollout of GDPR later this year.<br>
Now, turning to our second main growth area, which is additional sales through existing customers, which was previously referred to as pillars 3<br>and 4. In the fourth quarter, approximately 44% of our new first year orders during the quarter came from our installed base, which is just above<br>our average of 40% and totaled approximately $1.1 million. In the fourth quarter, we focused heavily on penetrating our installed base with<br>

ZixProtect and ZixArchive and as a result, saw a decrease in our add-ons fees for our core encryption offering, which was down from Q4 2016. On<br>the other hand, we had strong success selling ZixProtect and ZixArchive to more than 70 existing customers, totaling approximately $400,000 or<br>35% of our add-on sales.<br>
Looking to the rest of 2018 and beyond, selling additional value to our existing customers will remain a focus. We are pleased with the fact that<br>ZixProtect was nominated as the best e-mail security product by SC Media Awards, a great validation of the strength of our offer, which combined<br>with our growing list of reference customers, will help us continue to expand our add-on sales as well as addressing new customer opportunities.<br>
The third and final growth area is reducing churn and increasing retention, which effectively summarizes pillars 5 and 6, pillar 5 being customer<br>retention and pillar 6 being ongoing investment in our products.<br>
Looking back at 2017, we achieved a 100% renewal rate on our new EMS solution, which bolstered our already robust e-mail encryption capabilities.<br>Retention of our cloud-based customers was also well above 90%, contributing to our 87% growth in our most important strategic customer<br>segment. However, retention of our on-premise legacy Gateway customers is lagging, as legacy customers transition to Office 365. In spite of the<br>on-premise headwind, we did achieve 90% total dollar renewal rate for 2017, but we were a couple of hundred basis points below historical levels.<br>
As we have stated, the 2017 shortfall was largely due to M&amp;A activity for 3 health care customers and the impact of Office 365 migrations on our<br>on-premise customer base. We are working diligently to address the excess churn. In addition to the roadmap deliveries that I will describe later,<br>we have armed our customer success team with best-in-class data-driven tools to help us better understand our customers' current usage to better<br>assess and predict risk of nonrenewal. Where the risk of nonrenewal is highest, we're giving customer success team tools to address customer<br>concerns by one, commercially incenting migration to our cloud for on-premise customers; two, delivering enhanced value and simplicity with a<br>compelling bundle of cloud-based e-mail protection solutions; and three, when customers aren't willing or able to move to the cloud, we will work<br>towards longer-term renewals, especially with on-premise appliance customers.<br>
Migrating our on-premise customers to the cloud is our #1 priority because that is where they become stickier and where they can most easily take<br>advantage of the additional services we've added to our product suite. In fact, during 2017, we migrated 200 on-premise and dedicated hosted<br>customers to our multitenant standard cloud offer. This is up from 14 migrations for calendar year 2016. So you can see the impact cloud e-mail<br>migrations are having on our customers and how quickly we are responding.<br>
For the last 18 months, the majority of our R&amp;D roadmap has been dedicated to accelerating our cloud offerings. In particular, we're investing in<br>ZixCentral, our cloud-based offering, to bring it the feature parity with our on-premise Gateway, and we've made considerable progress on that<br>front. We made improvements throughout the year, and completed the first phase of integrating ZixProtect and ZixArchive into a single pane of<br>glass console and reporting interface. In January, we deployed it across more than 1,600 cloud customers. In April, we'll have our next major release<br>that integrates our bundle into a multi-tier MSP interface with 15-minute deployment, and will provide monthly billing options.<br>
Early in the second half of 2018, we will complete the integration of our cloud bundle with a refreshed user interface and integrated policy<br>management. The main takeaway here is that we're making meaningful investments to position us even more strongly from a product perspective.<br>
Our strategy is to continue building of our best-of-breed e-mail encryption solution to provide a suite of e-mail protection solutions that are targeted<br>to serve customers and compliance industries in the mid-market segment.<br>
Our solutions help assure compliance and security in an easy-to-use and cost-effective manner. When you put all of this together in a cloud-based<br>bundle, with exceptional availability and superior customer service and support, we believe that we're on a path to success.<br>
In closing, although we anticipate competitive pressures driven by the impact of cloud migrations on our on-premise customers to continue in<br>2018, we believe that Zix has never been in a stronger position than it is today. We're driving our business forward at an aggressive pace. We are<br>combating excess churn with focused programs and tools, and we've made the investment in our core encryption offer to intercept the market<br>momentum of e-mail for the cloud. In 2018, we look forward to building off the success that we're seeing with the 87% year-over-year growth in<br>our cloud encryption business and the accelerating momentum we're seeing for ZixProtect and ZixArchive.<br>

<A name=204></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ZIXI - Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call<br>
Now with that, we're ready to open the call for your questions. Andrew?<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mike Malouf with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.<br>
<b>Michael Fawzy Malouf</b> - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division - Partner, Senior Research Analyst &amp; Head of Boston Team<br>
A couple of things. I'm just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the churn, specifically as it relates to the Office 360 (sic) [Office<br>365] and just give us a sense where? I know you had a number of initiatives that were attacking that, and I'm just wondering if you could just drill<br>down a little bit more on that? And then, second of all, with 8% growth in this quarter, 4% to 6% next, and sort of 3% to 5% for the year, sort of<br>suggests continuing decreasing growth, and I'm just kind of wondering, as you look through the churn risk that you see this year, when do you<br>think that you'll get through that and potentially get some reacceleration in the numbers?<br>
<b>David J. Wagner</b> - Zix Corporation - CEO, President and Director<br>
Great. Those are great questions. Mike, so first of all, I'll talk about the churn. So we had the health care M&amp;A that we talked about, and the churn<br>in the Office 365 is -- we're seeing it primarily, and as we said, the on-prem appliance offer. And those customers are ones -- some of them are<br>on-premise for good reasons and don't plan to change, some of them haven't been paying as much attention to their e-mail environment as<br>perhaps they should be, and so when this -- the new leader comes in or they look at the cloud, they're taking everything at once, and moving<br>typically to the Office 365 solution in those instances. So typically, when a customer does that, they'll -- the e-mail manager that we typically deal<br>with will say, &quot;that decision was made by my boss. I didn't have any -- even awareness that it was happening.&quot; And that's what we're working to<br>get ahead of, so that -- those customers know that we have an offer. They know that when they move to the cloud with us, it makes the Office 365<br>migration easier when it happens, and so everything we're doing is focused on getting ahead of that trend. Maybe you could see just how quickly<br>we're able to do that with increase to 89% cloud deployment this year. So we're making -- with 200 migrations, we're making that transition quite<br>rapidly. When you look at the growth rate more specifically, the larger health care accounts that we talked about, even though we're aware of the<br>cancellation, they're moving out at different times, which is what's contributing to that kind of change in the growth rate throughout the year. And<br>last, but not least, I think, you asked about, when will this turn? And so what we're really excited about is how quickly we are moving the business<br>and intercepting this customer migration to the cloud. And we gave you a lots of numbers to evidence how well we're doing that. With 89% of our<br>new encryption orders being cloud-based, you can see from a new orders perspective, we are largely through that curve.<br>
So -- if the cloud migration continues at the pace at which it's going, then we should see this turn sometime in 2019.<br>
<b>Michael Fawzy Malouf</b> - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division - Partner, Senior Research Analyst &amp; Head of Boston Team<br>
Okay, great. And when you take a look at the overall growth of the market -- I know there are some industry analysts out there that have their<br>opinions, how are you looking at it as far as growth of the whole e-mail and Protect and Archive -- wherever you participate. How fast is that<br>growing?<br>
<b>David J. Wagner</b> - Zix Corporation - CEO, President and Director<br>
Well, so the -- it's really a transition from on-prem to cloud, and so that, Gartner would have the secured e-mail gateway growth in the low single<br>digits. Our perception is the encryption part of that is growing in the mid-single digits. And the opportunity that we're taking advantage of is that,<br>that rotation and being positioned to capture more and more of that cloud migration, which is why that 87% growth, we are seeing our cloud<br>

offers clearly way above market. And that's because we're coming off a small number, one; and two, we're moving customers. We have the<br>opportunity to move customers from on-prem to the cloud. That's accelerating that. But that's really the piece that we're excited about, that we're<br>leaning into, and we think there is a lot of room left still in this migration to capture share for these compliance-oriented customers, in particularly<br>in the mid-market segment.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Michael Kim with Imperial Capital.<br>
<b>Wonchoon Kim</b> - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division - SVP<br>
With the growth in ZixProtect and ZixArchive, hoping you'll shed a little more light on where you're seeing the earliest traction, especially on the<br>customer verticals? And how is that impacting overall deal sizes with the bundle sale?<br>
<b>David J. Wagner</b> - Zix Corporation - CEO, President and Director<br>
So that's a great question, Michael. So ZixProtect and ZixArchive, we're seeing it where you'd expect it, in health care, with half of our installed base<br>-- there you saw the great numbers, 35% of our orders into the base was ZixProtect and ZixArchive. Actually, our largest transaction in the quarter<br>was a complete sale full bundle offer, which was brought up the ASP in that account nicely. So that's where the real opportunity is. We're exceeding<br>our plan in new customers. So that attach rate is going a little bit better-than-expected than we expected, but it's the new customer opportunity<br>that we're really excited about. You know, the trend in the market that we talked about is to a bundle offer, and we're competing very effectively<br>in certain segments of the total e-mail protection offer. So that's been really good for us.<br>
<b>Wonchoon Kim</b> - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division - SVP<br>
Got it. I think you cited a competitive displacement in a couple of your larger deals -- bundled deals. Without going into maybe too much detail,<br>but can you talk about what led to those competitive displacements? Was it pricing? Efficacy? Did you put your system behind the competitor's<br>and catch just more malware? Any context on those displacements?<br>
<b>David J. Wagner</b> - Zix Corporation - CEO, President and Director<br>
Yes, it's in customers that -- it varied by competitor, obviously. So the customers who really know the Zix brand value service would be a common<br>thread throughout all of them. Yes, prices really have not been the driver. It's been -- it's service and customers feeling like, Zix has done a great<br>job for them for a long time, and trusting our brand and our capability with the full suite.<br>
<b>Wonchoon Kim</b> - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division - SVP<br>
Got it. And then just to expand on the MSP strategy. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you need to do there to invest or enable the MSPs<br>to drive that business? Sort of your expectations as we go through the second half of the year and the need to either establish or build upon your<br>existing MSP relationships?<br>
<b>David J. Wagner</b> - Zix Corporation - CEO, President and Director<br>
Yes, so that's a great question. The MSP part is -- one of the areas that we're most excited about is the first place where the full bundle offer is going<br>to be excel -- accessible easily in a single pane of glass with the very rapid deployment with automated key generation, et cetera. So that will roll<br>out on April 2. We've been talking to partners that have literally hundreds of thousands of mailboxes under management that see, particularly,<br>

<A name=206></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ZIXI - Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call<br>
adding Protect and Archive to existing encryption is an opportunity. And then, similar to what we've been seeing directly, we're having new MSP<br>partners that weren't previously considering Zix because we only had best-of-breed, they're now looking at Zix as a very attractive option for the<br>full suite. So I think we're going to see pickup with our existing MSPs, but probably, actually more quickly with new MSPs that we've not yet done<br>business with. So it'll be both sides, that one, Michael.<br>
<b>Wonchoon Kim</b> - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division - SVP<br>
And is that also part of the international growth strategy there, to leverage the MSP channel?<br>
<b>David J. Wagner</b> - Zix Corporation - CEO, President and Director<br>
So, internationally, we're still focusing on Zix Encrypt opportunity. So the first reseller in the U.K. will be -- they're an MSP. They'll be putting both<br>[terminologies], ZixGateway or ZixEncrypt into their data center, leveraging our ZixPort in the U.K. to have a solution that will integrate over there<br>with the DLP standard that they already are using to address GDPR.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Zack Turcotte with Dougherty.<br>
<b>Zack Turcotte</b><br>
Zack Turcotte on for Catharine here. Just a couple of things real quick. So first, you kind of touched on it, but are you still mainly targeting the<br>less-than-a-thousand mailbox segment or smaller than that? And do you think that with the success you've been having with resellers and strategy<br>going forward to focus on the channel even more? Is that going to bring you upmarket a little bit and see some bigger competitors and deals<br>there?<br>
<b>David J. Wagner</b> - Zix Corporation - CEO, President and Director<br>
Great question. The transition to over-a-thousand mailboxes really started in October. Prior to October, we were not encouraging enterprise sales<br>team to sell ZixProtect and ZixArchive. With the success we had in our first 4 months, we then opened up back to the enterprise sales team and<br>we had good success in landing several customers with, I guess, typically less than 20,000 mailboxes -- none were higher than 20,000 mailboxes,<br>but in that greater-than-one mailbox -- 1,000 mailbox space. And where we worked really well is when, again, where customers value ease-of-use<br>and customer support. We're seeing that extending, depending on the kind of customer, up into the tens of thousands of mailboxes. On the reseller<br>side, I see that as being about 3 quarters behind our direct sales team. We focused, obviously, on -- maybe not obviously, but we focused on training<br>up our sale -- our direct sales reps first. We've been leaning into training VARs more aggressively since the Fall, and we saw a little bit of contribution<br>in Q4. We would expect that to be increasing. So that's -- those are the areas, the MSPs and the VARs, that we're seeing good opportunity. I'm not<br>sure if that'll take us up so much into bigger deal sizes, but getting deeper penetration into that mid-market segment that we're really focused on.<br>
<b>Zack Turcotte</b><br>
Got it. And the only other thing, I know it's still pretty early in the bundling strategy, but do you continue to still have a strong -- you still have a<br>strong balance sheet, so do you continue to look for M&amp;A opportunities to expand even further in the product line and push even harder into the<br>bundling strategy right from the beginning?<br>

<A name=210></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ASPN - Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call<br>
I'll now turn the call over to Don Young, President and CEO of Aspen Aerogels.<br>
<b>Donald R. Young</b> - Aspen Aerogels, Inc. - CEO, President and Director<br>
Thank you, John. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our Q4 and fiscal year 2017 earnings call. I will start by providing comments about<br>the business and our performance. Next, John will review our Q4 and fiscal year 2017 financial performance and provide 2018 guidance. We will<br>conclude the call with a Q&amp;A session.<br>
I plan to cover 5 topics in my prepared remarks. First, I will comment on our patent enforcement wins at the United States Patent and Trademark<br>Office, the USPTO, the United States International Trade Commission, the ITC, and in the German court.<br>
Second, I will comment on the $5 million prepayment that we will receive from BASF during 2018 and the significant progress we have made in<br>our strategic relationship with them.<br>
Third, I will review our actual performance against our 2017 key performance indicators and introduce 3 key performance indicators for 2018.<br>
Fourth, I will discuss the current commercial environment, including our market outlook for 2018.<br>
And fifth, I will provide an updated view of our strategy, which is centered, in part, on our strong capability to help our customers and partners<br>shape their own strategies around the global mega trends of resource efficiency and sustainability, help them combine economic success with<br>environmental protection and social responsibility. I will also describe the strategic opportunities available to us as we leverage our aerogel<br>technology platform across our core, adjacent and new markets.<br>
My first topic today is IP enforcement. In April 2016, we initiated a series of legal actions to assert our rights against companies that infringe our<br>intellectual property. Since that time, we have logged several victories. During the first half of 2017, one defendant challenged the validity of our<br>patents at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This challenge was denied by a panel of 3 patent judges at the USPTO, a very favorable<br>outcome for Aspen.<br>
Then, in September 2017, the ITC judge issued an initial determination, finding our patent claims valid and infringed upon by the Chinese companies.<br>The judge recommended a limited exclusion order as the remedy to prevent the importation of infringing aerogel products into United States.<br>
In early February, the full ITC Commission issued a final determination confirming the judge's conclusions and issued a limited exclusion order<br>prohibiting the entry of infringing products into the United States.<br>
Also, in January 2018, a German court issued a series of judgments and injunctions against a Dutch distributor, prohibiting the resale of aerogel<br>products originating from China. In the settlement, the distributor agreed not to resell infringing aerogel blankets in all European countries where<br>we have patents.<br>
We believe these wins at the USPTO, the ITC and in the German court, clearly validate the strength of our patent portfolio and demonstrate the<br>unique value of our aerogel technology platform -- brings to our business partners around the world.<br>
My second topic today is the $5 million prepayment we will receive from BASF in 2018. BASF is clearly among our most important global business<br>partners. In June 2016, we signed agreements with BASF that included commercial, technical and financial elements. The financial support was<br>initially linked to our capacity expansion plan in Statesboro, Georgia.<br>
Last week, we amended the agreements to receive $5 million in prepayments in 2018, which will be focused principally on 2 initiatives. The first<br>initiative is our joint development work with BASF, focused on building insulation. We have made rapid technical progress on an important<br>next-generation product, which has world-class thermal properties and is noncombustible and easy to use. We, both BASF and Aspen, are excited<br>

<A name=211></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ASPN - Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call<br>
about completing these development efforts and realizing the potential of our combined technologies. The $5 million prepayment will help to<br>accelerate these efforts.<br>
The second initiative is our new EP20 capacity expansion project. The goal of EP20 is to increase the manufacturing capacity of our East Providence<br>facility by 20% by the end of 2020. Additional capacity in our existing facility is very valuable. With growth in revenue from our 2017 level of<br>approximately $110 million to our current revenue capacity of approximately $150 million, we estimate that our adjusted EBITDA, excluding IP<br>enforcement costs, will increase from breakeven in 2017 to a projected range of between $16 million and $20 million. In other words, 40% to 50%<br>of the revenue we generate from current levels, drops to the adjusted EBITDA line.<br>
The goal of our EP20 project is to expand our current revenue capacity from approximately $150 million to approximately $180 million per year.<br>At $180 million, we project that the East Providence facility would have the potential to generate adjusted EBITDA in the range of $28 million to<br>$35 million per year. The $5 million prepayment from BASF will help to accelerate the EP20 project, which in turn will significantly enhance the<br>profit potential and economic profile of our existing business.<br>
Our third topic today is to review our actual performance against our 2017 key performance indicators and to introduce 3 indicators for 2018. Our<br>first 2017 performance indicator was to grow revenue each quarter by gaining market share in our core end markets, principally refinery and<br>petrochemical companies, demonstrating value and growth in our adjacent markets, including LNG, district energy and power and taking a<br>partnered approach in the development of new market, including building materials. We met the goal in 2017 by growing revenue from $23 million<br>in Q1 to $25 million in Q2, to $27 million in Q3 and to $36 million in Q4. We believe this momentum is an important first step towards achieving<br>our goal to deliver long-term growth in revenue and profitability.<br>
The second indicator was centered on our revenue not comprised of subsea in the South Asia petrochemical project. To provide context, it is<br>important to remember that subsea and the South Asia petrochemical project together accounted for approximately 30% of our revenue in both<br>2015 and 2016. However, in 2017, we had anticipated this revenue would account for less than 10% of our total revenue.<br>
Tracking revenue, other than subsea and the South Asian petrochemical project, enables us to gauge our day-in and day-out maintenance in small<br>project work, revenue which, we believe, is the base for sustained future growth.<br>
Entering 2017, we knew we needed to grow base revenue to at least $90 million in order to meet our revenue guidance for the year. For perspective,<br>our base revenue has grown in millions of dollars from the low 70s in 2013 and 2014 to the low 80s in 2015 and 2016.<br>
While we reached our target for overall revenue in 2017 and achieved record base revenue of $88 million, we fell short of our 2017 target of $90<br>million. This shortfall is one of the 3 main reasons why we are cautious with our 2018 revenue guidance. We will continue to track base revenue as<br>a performance indicator during 2018, and will increase the target to $100 million.<br>
The third 2017 performance indicator was related to the strategic importance of diversifying into adjacent markets. We launched on schedule in<br>July 2017 our new product, Pyrogel HPS, targeting the power industry, an industry that consumes $1.4 billion of insulation per year.<br>
We define success to be our ability to generate $1 million to $3 million of revenue, to build a portfolio of case studies and to begin the typical<br>adoption progression for maintenance work to small scope project work and then on to larger-scale project work. We succeeded in meeting these<br>performance indicators.<br>
In addition, we worked our way into the global specifications of several key players in this market, including the major turbine manufacturers,<br>which is a critical step as we work the adoption progression. And the successful rollout of Pyrogel HPS is an important demonstration of our core<br>competency to commercialize innovation, that is, our ability to leverage our aerogel technology platform and to develop and commercialize<br>innovative aerogel products in adjacent and new markets.<br>
Looking forward to 2018, the 3 performance indicators we will track involve base revenue, year-to-date growth in both revenue and adjusted<br>EBITDA and the EP20 project.<br>

<hr>
<A name=212></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ASPN - Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call<br>
The first performance indicator, base revenue -- again, revenue not comprised of subsea or the large South Asia petrochemical project, is a good<br>indicator of day-in and day-out maintenance and small scope project work, our version of a recurring revenue stream. We are targeting $100 million<br>in base revenue for 2018, representing year-over-year growth in base revenue in the range of 10% to 15%.<br>
The second performance indicator for 2018 relates to growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The performance indicator is growth in year-to-date<br>revenue and adjusted EBITDA as measured at the end of each quarter. After delivering a 30% revenue CAGR from 2008 through 2015, our goal is<br>to return to double-digit revenue growth, and we firmly believe that significant growth in adjusted EBITDA will follow.<br>
We envision a strong energy infrastructure business that generates cash to reinvest in realizing the substantial potential in our core and adjacent<br>markets and to fund select business opportunities in new markets, which can lead to breakout value.<br>
The third 2018 performance metric relates to the EP20 initiative. Again, our goal is to increase the capacity in our East Providence manufacturing<br>facility by 20% by the end of 2020. The capacity expansion to our existing manufacturing assets will be driven primarily by process technology<br>advancements, designed to improve manufacturing productivity and capital efficiency.<br>
We believe the EP20 plan is achievable because we have tested the concept in advance in our full-scale pilot plan, which we commissioned in 2016.<br>We will also conduct several studies during 2018 that will lay the foundation for EP20 work planned for the second and third years.<br>
Our 2018 capital budget for EP20 is $3 million, which will be supported by the prepayment from BASF. We will report out on the 3 2018 performance<br>indicators each quarter. Again, the 3 indicators are expanding our base revenue, driving year-to-date growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA<br>and increasing capacity through our EP20 initiative.<br>
Our fourth topic today is a discussion of the current commercial environment. While we have continued to diversify our revenue successfully with<br>growth in our adjacent markets, we remain linked to oil prices and related energy infrastructure activity levels. WTI crude prices were roughly $55<br>per barrel a year ago and moved $10 per barrel in each direction, up and down, during the year and are now at approximately $60 per barrel. This<br>deal's reasonably stable relative to the $108 to $28 per barrel slide that we experienced during the 2014, 2015 and 2016 time frame.<br>
While the market feels better today than it did one year ago, we remain cautious for 2018 for 3 reasons. First, as I stated earlier, we've slightly<br>underachieved on our 2017 base revenue performance metric at $88 million versus our goal of reaching or surpassing $90 million. While we reached<br>the upper end of our 2017 revenue guidance, and we have set an aggressive goal of $100 million for base revenue in 2018, we were disappointed<br>that we did not achieve the 10% to 15% base revenue growth during 2017 that we wanted. This is one of the reasons why we have chosen to be<br>cautious in our revenue outlook in 2018.<br>
The second reason we are cautious on our 2018 revenue guidance, again relates to base revenue. While we underachieved our base revenue in<br>2017, we overachieved against our expectations in the subsea market and on the continued supply to the South Asia petrochemical project,<br>reaching 19% of total revenue in 2017. We expect that percentage to be in the 7% to 10% range for 2018, a $9 million to $14 million drop in nonbase<br>revenue. We expect to make up most or all of that revenue loss in 2018 with significant base revenue growth, but nevertheless it is a big hole to<br>fill.<br>
The third reason we remain cautious for 2018 revenue guidance is because insulation is a late cycle product. The fundamentals and activity levels<br>of the market are stronger and momentum appears to be building. As you may remember, we were beneficiaries of late cycle activity in Q4 2015,<br>a period of time when WTI crude was heading to prices under $30 per barrel. Even though oil prices were crashing and the market was weak, the<br>flywheel was still turning for us and we posted a record quarter with $37.4 million of revenue and $5.4 million of adjusted EBITDA. If current market<br>conditions continue to build strength through 2018, we would expect to feel the full positive impact in 2019 and into 2020.<br>
We are encouraged by the -- by market activity levels. We believe, if we can get out in front of business in a timely way, that we will continue to<br>win a growing market share. We are increasing the size of our sales force by 25% in order to take increasing market share in a strengthening<br>commercial environment, an action we believe will enable us to outpace the market and result in strong growth.<br>

<A name=213></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ASPN - Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call<br>
We are making outstanding progress in executing our strategy to leverage our aerogel technology platform across our core, adjacent and new<br>markets. Our ability to build base revenue, to position ourselves for significant project work and to continue to exhibit strength in entering new<br>markets, gives us confidence that over a 2- to 3-year period we can experience substantial and diverse growth, even within the current energy<br>price environment.<br>
This narrative leads to our fifth and final topic, which is the articulation of our strategy. Our strategy is to leverage our aerogel technology platform.<br>There are 3 key elements. The first element is to grow our core and adjacent markets to fully utilize the East Providence manufacturing facility,<br>including the expanded capacity from the EP20 initiative. At capacity, we would have the potential to be a business generating $180 million of<br>revenue and adjusted EBITDA of between $28 million and $35 million.<br>
The second element is to organize around innovation and to leverage our core competency of commercializing innovation. We have world-class<br>aerogel product and process technology and the premier aerogel research science is committed to continuing to advance the science. We have<br>created a new business development team dedicated to prioritizing the best opportunities for our aerogel technology platform in order to address<br>significant global challenges and to identify world-class partners and optimal business structures to accelerate value creation.<br>
The third element of the strategy is to maximize long-term shareholder value. With revenue growth in our core and adjacent markets, combined<br>with the improved profit potential in our East Providence plant associated with our EP20 project, we believe we can generate free cash to invest<br>in 1 or 2 new business opportunities where our aerogel technology platform has the potential to create breakout value. Our vision for Aspen is to<br>be a prosperous and valuable leader in our core and adjacent markets and to have the potential for breakout value in new markets.<br>
Overall, we are confident that the strength of our technology and the ROI that we bring to our end users across multiple markets will enable solid<br>performance for our company. Our progress from core to adjacent and to new markets is powerful and creates the opportunity to build a large<br>and profitable company. We have an experienced team of people, and we are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and to realize our<br>vision for the company.<br>
Now, I'll turn the call over to John for a review of the financial results.<br>
<b>John F. Fairbanks</b> - Aspen Aerogels, Inc. - CFO, VP and Treasurer<br>
Thanks, Don, and good afternoon. I'd like to start by running through our reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 at a<br>summary level.<br>
Fourth quarter total revenue grew 32% to $36.4 million versus $27.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter net loss was $1.7 million<br>or $0.07 per share compared to $5.7 million or $0.25 per share last year.<br>
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was positive $2.2 million compared to negative $2.1 million a year ago. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income<br>or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other items that we do not believe are indicative<br>of our core operating performance.<br>
Patent enforcement costs had a less significant impact on our net loss and adjusted EBITDA during the fourth quarter this year than in the fourth<br>quarter of last year. We incurred $600,000 of patent enforcement costs during the fourth quarter versus $1.9 million in the fourth quarter last year.<br>
For the full year, total revenue declined 5% to $111.6 million. Net loss was $19.3 million or $0.83 per share in 2017 versus a net loss of $12 million<br>or $0.52 per share last year. And adjusted EBITDA for the year was negative $3.3 million compared to positive $3.9 million a year ago.<br>
Patent enforcement costs had a significant impact on both our net loss and adjusted EBITDA during both 2017 and 2016. We incurred $3.5 million<br>of patent enforcement costs during 2017 versus $3.6 million in 2016.<br>

<A name=214></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ASPN - Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call<br>
Our performance during the fourth quarter again met our objectives, to build sequential quarterly momentum during the year. Total revenue this<br>year improved from a low of $23 million in the first quarter to a high of $36.4 million in the fourth quarter.<br>
As we discussed during our previous conference calls, our gross profit and gross margin are highly dependent on product revenue and capacity<br>utilization level. Principally as a result of the growth in quarterly revenue during the year, gross margin improved from a low of 10% in the first<br>quarter to a high of 21% in the fourth quarter.<br>
Gross profit dollars also improved from $2.2 million in the first quarter to $7.8 million in the fourth quarter. The adjusted EBITDA improved from<br>negative $5.1 million in the first quarter to a positive $2.2 million in the fourth quarter.<br>
With future revenue and utilization growth, we would expect to see percentage growth in gross profit and adjusted EBITDA continue to outpace<br>the associated growth in product revenue.<br>
I'll now provide additional detail on the components of our results. First, I'll discuss revenue. Fourth quarter total revenue was comprised of product<br>revenue of $35.9 million and research services revenue of $472,000. Total revenue for the year was comprised of product revenue of $109.6 million<br>and research services revenue of $2 million.<br>
During the fourth quarter, product revenue increased by $8.7 million, or 32%, to $35.9 million versus $27.2 million last year. Fourth quarter product<br>revenue growth was driven by strong demand in the U.S. and European markets and a high volume of subsea project work.<br>
During the quarter, total shipments increased by 12% to 11.9 million square feet of aerogel blankets. And our average selling price increased by<br>18% to $3.02 per square foot, principally due to the increase in the mix of higher price subsea products this year.<br>
For the full year, product revenue decreased by $5.9 million or 5% versus last year. This decrease was driven in large part by the conclusion of<br>shipments to the multiyear South Asia petrochemical project.<br>
For 2017, total shipments decreased by 15% to 37.5 million square feet, while our average selling price increased by 12% versus 2016 to $2.92 per<br>square foot. Price increase during the year reflected both the increase in mix of our higher-price subsea products and a decrease in revenue from<br>our lower-price South Asia petrochemical project.<br>
Looking forward, we anticipate broad-based growth across our core and adjacent markets will offset most or all of the expected revenue decline<br>associated with the completion of the South Asia petrochemical project and a decline in the subsea market.<br>
Revenue generated in the subsea market and from the multiyear South Asia petrochemical project contributed $21 million to total revenue in<br>2017. Our 2018 revenue forecast anticipates a decline in revenue in these markets to approximately $7 million to $12 million, although project<br>work can be difficult to predict.<br>
Our 2018 revenue forecast anticipates revenue growth in our base business of approximately $9 million to $14 million, or 10% to 15%, to a range<br>of between $97 million and $102 million. As a result, we expect product revenue -- total product revenue during 2018 of between $104 million<br>and $114 million compared to the $109 million we generated during 2017. This expectation is reflected in our 2018 annual guidance.<br>
We expect our average selling price for 2018 will remain flat from 2017 at $2.92 per square foot, plus or minus $0.05, with the impact of a 2%<br>effective price increase in 2018 offset by the anticipated reduction in the mix of our higher-price subsea revenue. This average selling price<br>expectation is also reflected in our 2018 guidance.<br>
I'll now turn to our research services revenue. Our research services revenue is related to contract research performed principally for government<br>agencies. Research services revenue was $473,000 during the fourth quarter and $2 million during the year. For 2018, we expect research services<br>revenue of approximately $1.75 million, down slightly from 2017. This expectation is reflected as well in our 2018 guidance.<br>

<hr>
<A name=215></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ASPN - Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call<br>
Next, I'll discuss gross profit. Gross profit was $7.8 million or 21% of revenue during the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $3.7 million or 13% last year.<br>This improvement in gross profit and gross margin was driven by the 18% increase in average selling prices for our products; the 12% growth in<br>shipment volume, offset in part by a 7% decrease in production volume that we instituted to manage inventory balances; and a volume-related<br>increase in material costs during the quarter.<br>
As a reminder, our variable contribution margin is approximately 45%. As a result, an increase in revenue and capacity utilization will lead to a<br>disproportionate increase in both gross profit and gross margin.<br>
This case held true in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 32% growth in revenue versus 2016 led to an expansion of our gross margin by nearly 800 basis<br>points and a 109% increase in gross profit dollars.<br>
For the year, gross profit was $18.7 million or 17% of revenue versus $23.3 million or 20% of revenue last year. Declining gross profit and gross<br>margin this year was largely the result of the 15% decline in shipment volume, the cumulative 25% reduction in production volume enacted to<br>manage inventory balances, and a small increase in material and warranty costs, offset in part, by the 12% increase in our average selling price for<br>our products and a decrease in manufacturing expenses during the period.<br>
Looking forward to 2018, we expect gross margins to remain in the high teens for the full year, but like 2017, quarterly gross margins could run<br>from the low double digits to the low 20s depending on quarterly revenue volume.<br>
This gross margin expectation includes our planned investment in manufacturing personnel to reestablish full-time 3 line operations in the East<br>Providence plant, to improve manufacturing productivity and costs, and in support of our EP20 initiative to expand the capacity of the East<br>Providence facility by 20% by the end of 2020. This gross margin expectation is included in our 2018 guidance.<br>
Next, I'll discuss operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses were flat to last year at $9.4 million. For the year, operating expenses grew<br>by $3.3 million or 9% versus last year to $37.8 million.<br>
Looking forward, our 2018 guidance includes our expectation that operating expenses will increase by 4% to slightly more than $39 million for<br>2018. This projected operating expense increase reflects our planned investment in sales, research and support personnel, and expense to drive<br>growth in our energy infrastructure business, and to develop breakout opportunities in new markets, offset in part by a projected decline in patent<br>enforcement costs of approximately $2.5 million.<br>
Next, I'll discuss our balance sheet and cash flow for 2017. Cash used in operations of $4.6 million reflected our negative adjusted EBITDA of $3.3<br>million and $1.3 million of cash used for working capital during the year. This use of cash for working capital was higher than we had recently<br>projected. In particular, our accounts receivable balance at year-end was temporarily higher than expected due to strong project-related revenue<br>during the fourth quarter.<br>
Capital expenditures for the year totaled $6.1 million in line with our guidance of $6.3 million and down from $13 million in 2016.<br>
We ended 2017 with $10.7 million of cash, $3.8 million on our revolving credit facility, net current assets of $26.1 million, and shareholders' equity<br>of $101 million. And importantly, we had access to an additional $13.9 million under our revolving credit facility at year-end.<br>
I'll now summarize our full year financial outlook for 2018. Total revenue is expected to range between $106 million and $116 million. Net loss is<br>expected to range between $16.9 million and $19.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between a loss of $2 million and a loss of $5<br>million. EPS is expected to range between a loss of $0.71, a loss of $0.85 per share. This EPS guidance assumes a weighted average of 23.6 million<br>shares outstanding for the year.<br>
The 2018 outlook also assumes depreciation and amortization of $10.3 million, stock-based compensation of $4.3 million, and interest expense of<br>$300,000.<br>

<A name=216></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ASPN - Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call<br>
In addition, this financial outlook includes between $1 million and $1.3 million of cost and expenses associated with our patent enforcement actions<br>for the year. And for the full year, we expect a gross margin in the high teens and an average selling price of $2.92 per square foot, plus or minus<br>$0.05.<br>
During 2018, we'll continue our focus on controlling capital expenditures to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. Our 2018<br>capital budget of $4 million is comprised of $1 million of maintenance-related capital projects and $3 million for our EP20 initiative to expand the<br>capacity of the East Providence facility by 20% by the end of 2020.<br>
Turning to cash at an aggregate level. Within the context of the adjusted EBITDA range in our 2018 full year outlook, we expect to exit 2018 with<br>between $8 million and $11 million of net cash on hand.<br>
As Don mentioned, we have amended our supply agreement with BASF to secure $5 million in advance payments in 2018 to help support our<br>capacity expansion plans, our process improvement initiatives, and our new-business development efforts. This $5 million in advance payments<br>is included in our 2018 year-end cash guidance.<br>
While we don't provide specific quarterly guidance on a routine basis, we think it's important from time to time to provide our investors with a<br>general view to our expectations during the year.<br>
In general, we expect our quarterly financial performance in 2018 to mirror the profile of our 2017 quarterly performance with a significant step-down<br>in revenue and profitability in the first quarter and sequential quarterly growth thereafter.<br>
We're also striving to deliver year-over-year improvement in financial performance during each of the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month year-to-date periods<br>during 2018 and to enter 2019 with strong operating and financial momentum.<br>
I'll now turn the call back to Chantel for Q&amp;A.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum.<br>
<b>Eric Andrew Stine</b> - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst<br>
Just wondering, could you just help us bridge the fact that you're guiding to flat revenues but also taking these steps to bring on capacity, and I<br>know that's by 2020, but flat revenues has got a lot of room now. Just a thought process, is it some of the large project activity that you expect to<br>hit starting in 2019, views of some partnerships on the horizon? Or how should we think about that?<br>
<b>Donald R. Young</b> - Aspen Aerogels, Inc. - CEO, President and Director<br>
I think there are maybe 2 ways of doing it. When we're doing an expansion in a plant -- in this particular one, where we're really improving the<br>process technology of our existing assets as opposed to adding new assets to the facility, kind of the brute force method, it's very difficult to do<br>that kind of work while you're operating the plant full out. And so this is the time to do that work. So we've got the perfect time to do it, one. And<br>of course, we wouldn't do it if we weren't confident that we could grow our revenues to that $150 million level and to the $180 million level. You<br>just wouldn't do this. And so that's in the backdrop as well. So our goal here is to continue to grow that base revenue, and we said a few times in<br>our presentation this evening, in that 10% to 15% range year in and year out, and then put some projects on top of it. As you know Eric, we've<br>worked that progression from doing maintenance work to small-scope work to large-scope project work, pretty successfully. And LNG is the best<br>

-- most recent example of that, and we believe with the successful delivering of 3 projects in 2017, that those will lead to additional projects and<br>larger projects in the LNG area, for example, in that 2019 and 2020 time frame. So we're doing this with purpose, and we also believe that it's just<br>the right time to do it, and there's no question that having BASF help shoulder the load a bit here financially is really important to us.<br>
<b>Eric Andrew Stine</b> - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst<br>
Right. And that's a good segue to my second question. Just -- I mean, it seems like the health of that relationship with BASF is in very good shape<br>is this -- is this a case where -- I mean, should we think about that Plant 2 -- I mean, it would seem that this pushes that off quite a bit, or that BASF<br>doesn't necessarily care whether their $20 million eventually goes to Plant 2 or it's invested in your plant. They just want to have that capacity?<br>
<b>Donald R. Young</b> - Aspen Aerogels, Inc. - CEO, President and Director<br>
Yes, they would like access to the -- guaranteed access to the capacity. If you go back to the 2015, early '16 time frame, there were points in time<br>where we were capacity constrained significantly -- '14, '15 and the early '16, and they were concerned about having that happen to them again.<br>And so that's part of their motivation here in helping us with our capacity expansion. And it obviously, provides a nice sort of baseload activity for<br>us as well as we go out and create this new capacity. So those are the drivers. The relationship is very strong. We've talked a bit here about the<br>financial parts of it, but they've helped us with some of the operating improvements that we're making in our facility in East Providence, and of<br>course, working closely with us through the JDA on these next-generation products as well. So it's a strong relationship but we really appreciate<br>their help.<br>
<b>Eric Andrew Stine</b> - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst<br>
Right, okay. Maybe last one from me. Just on subsea yesterday, Technip had their call, and they had pretty positive commentary on activity continuing<br>in 2018 and going forward. Is your view of 2018 more a case of -- I know you don't report a backlog, but that the backlog for subsea as it stands<br>today isn't necessarily there, and it's more about if you were to get awards, you're late cycle, and so that would be more late '18 and -- or 2019 work.<br>Is that the reason? Because I mean, what Technip said and what you're looking for, those are different views.<br>
<b>Donald R. Young</b> - Aspen Aerogels, Inc. - CEO, President and Director<br>
So Technip has been our largest customer in the subsea dating back to 2004 and '05, so they've been a great partner of ours through that period.<br>And I was encouraged to hear their report. I listened in and read their work. Subsea is really difficult for us to project. We are bird-dogging more<br>than a dozen projects today around the world in the subsea. And those could break anytime. So the hard part is predicting it. And we just -- if you<br>just look at the last 3 years, and John correct me if I'm wrong, if I remember correctly, the subsea numbers were $24 million, $4 million and $14<br>million. So they're just banging all around the place. So it's really difficult to kind of want to hang your hat on any particular number. And so what<br>we do is we take a longer-term view of it and just try to find kind of an average number. And if you go out 5 years, the average number is kind of<br>in that 7, 8, 9 kind of range, and we're sort of just projecting that forward here in 2018. Look, we hope Technip is spot on. I mean, they are really<br>right in the middle of that market, obviously, so they know a lot. Yes, we do come a little late cycle, so maybe it would have the biggest impact on<br>us late '18 and into 2019. We feel good about 2019 for a lot of different reasons and that's one of them.<br>

<A name=218></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, ASPN - Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Chip Moore</b> - Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - Senior Associate<br>
Maybe you can dive in a little bit more on EP20. That $3 million next year, sort of, where does that get you to? And then, when we think about the<br>ramp-up to that $180 million capacity, what additional sort of investments will that take?<br>
<b>John F. Fairbanks</b> - Aspen Aerogels, Inc. - CFO, VP and Treasurer<br>
So Chip, the overall project we've earmarked between $15 million and $20 million to achieve the 20%. We'll obviously focus on projects that we<br>get the best bang for the buck initially with that money. So that original -- that initial $3 million will go a long way towards gaining some fairly<br>significant capacity during the year. And we'll apprise you of our progress during the year as we go, rather than setting expectations, but we'll let<br>you know what advances we're making and what we're seeing in terms of capacity improvement. And the $15 million to $20 million is that long-term<br>message, principally capital spending. So it would be -- it's in the initial $3 million out of essentially a minimum of $15 million. So we'd expect to<br>increase our spending in 2019 and 2020 to ultimately complete that project.<br>
<b>Chip Moore</b> - Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - Senior Associate<br>
That's perfect. That's helpful. And it seems like a nice flexible approach. And maybe if we can touch just a little bit more about some of the markets.<br>It sounds like you've seen pretty broad-based growth across all the different areas, but maybe if you could just give us a little more color on some<br>of those individual markets?<br>
<b>Donald R. Young</b> - Aspen Aerogels, Inc. - CEO, President and Director<br>
Well, let me just -- I can just make a couple of comments. We had nice growth in 2017, in both the United States and in -- and across Europe. Good<br>growth numbers, very significant numbers, in fact, in the U.S. and continuing good momentum in that market. And I talked about increasing the<br>size of our sales force. I'm really -- after a good amount of travel in the second half of 2017, I'm convinced that if we can get in front of business in<br>a timely way, our products are now well accepted. They're well proven. They're no longer exotic or novel products, and if we can get in front of<br>business -- and when I say in a timely way, I mean, getting the specifications early on of some of these mid- and large-size projects. I think we'll win<br>more than our fair share of that work. So I'm feeling good about -- through the maturation level of our product or of that adoption cycle, and so<br>that's been good. I feel good about that. I've talked in the past a bit about the LNG market. Again, we were very successful delivering the 3 projects,<br>and the engineering companies and the asset owners gave us very high marks for doing what we said we would do and for that product to be<br>valuable to them. And as you look forward, some of those very same engineering companies and end-users, asset owners, have next-stage projects<br>right on the drawing board. And so we're in a terrific position to compete, not so much for the size that we did in 2017, you'll remember, those<br>were $3 million, $5 million and $8 million in size, but for projects that could be measured, you know, in the $10 million, $20 million, even $30 million<br>kinds of range, so we've done a terrific job doing that. And also, I just want to focus on the adjacent markets in addition to LNG. Our district energy<br>business and the launch of our HPS project -- product have continued to be successful. So getting incremental growth from those segments is<br>really critical to us as we grow base revenue and position ourselves for some good project work.<br>

I just want to come back to an earlier question because I'm still not too sure if I fully understand the basis of investment and making that decision<br>today. When I step back and I think about, we've got a core business where, initially last year, you were looking to do $90 million to $100 million.<br>That got pared back. Then we were looking to do $90 million, and then we were beneath that. We're looking, as an aspiration, to hit $100 million,<br>

but you guys expressed some conservatism around that. The other aspects of your business and looking about -- or looking at the project orientation,<br>was a lot of variability there. And so it almost seems like we're really kind of building some flex capacity to accommodate a few LNG projects that<br>are going to be fairly finite. I may be misinterpreting things, but can you help me to better understand this, because once we expand, if we're there<br>in 2020, I would want to think that we have a good base to our core business that is justifying that, versus the project side. Any help around that<br>would be great.<br>
<b>Donald R. Young</b> - Aspen Aerogels, Inc. - CEO, President and Director<br>
So our target for base revenue this year is $100 million, and we're going to put all our resources into achieving that number. And I would anticipate<br>that, that number continues to grow in that 10% to 15% range, year in and year out, as we move forward. And if you start to put a couple of projects<br>on top of that level, over the course of 2018, 2019 and 2020, we are pushing up hard against that 150 number. And second, as I said earlier, the<br>only time we can really make these investments in the East Providence is not when you're running full out at 100% capacity, but as you lead up to<br>that, where you have a little bit of flexibility in your management of that facility. And so we are making that -- we have a strong conviction that<br>we're going to grow in the way that I just talked about, and that's why we're making those investments now.<br>
<b>John F. Fairbanks</b> - Aspen Aerogels, Inc. - CFO, VP and Treasurer<br>
And one other point, Sean. Some of the advancements that we'll make this year with that $3 million in capital expenditures, will be to improve<br>yields in our plant. And that -- those yield improvements increase our output, but it also drops our costs, and so there'll be a benefit to the bottom<br>line that will accrue later in 2018 into 2019 and '20. So we -- it will help us becomes more profitable. The other piece of it is the EP20 projects<br>themselves are principally capital. So it's capital expenditures. Yet this will not require us to increase the operating expense levels in our business,<br>and that's why that incremental profitability associated with the increase -- the potential profitability associated with that increase of $30 million<br>from $150 million to $180 million is so profitable to us. So I think this -- that the investment we're making in 2018 is limited to that $3 million of<br>CapEx. It's the right time for those projects. When we start to fill the plant, we won't be able to accomplish those projects. We'll get an immediate<br>benefit from yield improvement, and then we'll get the benefit of improved profitability and cash flow when we do fill the plant. And so from that<br>perspective, we felt it was the right time to make the investment.<br>
<b>Sean Kilian Flanagan Hannan</b> - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Smart Grid, Electronic Mfg Svcs, IT Components<br>&amp; Electronic Components<br>
Okay, I understand. I follow that, and I suppose that perhaps what it then comes back to me is where the confidence is in the growth factor for that<br>core business, because again, last year we ended up in a very different place versus where our expectations were going to be. And again, this year<br>as you guys are targeting that $100 million, unless I heard you incorrectly, it sounded like you were explicitly stating, we want to be cautious and<br>conservative. And there are asterisks that you're putting around that. So I'm just trying to bridge the gap, as I hear those types of comments versus<br>then -- Don, a moment ago, it sounds like you're very confident in growing that 10% to 15%. So I'm just trying to connect the dots, guys.<br>
<b>Donald R. Young</b> - Aspen Aerogels, Inc. - CEO, President and Director<br>
Yes, yes, look..<br>
<b>Sean Kilian Flanagan Hannan</b> - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Smart Grid, Electronic Mfg Svcs, IT Components<br>&amp; Electronic Components<br>
And I'm sorry, I don't mean to come across the wrong way. I just -- yes, I just want to make sure I understand this correctly.<br>

<b>Donald R. Young</b> - Aspen Aerogels, Inc. - CEO, President and Director<br>
Right. Look, we agree with you that there are -- that our confidence level, as depicted by the fact that we're willing to make these investments in<br>expanding capacity, and the fact that we are growing our sales force by 25%, those are the actions of a management team that feels strongly about<br>their business. And I -- look, I recognize that, that feels a little out of sync with our revenue guidance that we gave, which I think to -- is cautious, I<br>think, is the word I use and the word that you repeated. And so I understand there's a little tension between those 2 things. We do think the late-cycle<br>impact has some real ramification for us, and we think we will build throughout this year, and we think we'll position ourselves very well for '19<br>and '20. As that flywheel starts to spin here a little bit, we're feeling a good U.S. market right now. We overachieved in Europe last year. So there<br>are a lot of positive things going on. We just want to see them take hold here. And I think our performance metric in 2018 of year-to-date growth,<br>in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA at -- as measured at each quarter, is going to be a really strong metric for us. And I would just anticipate<br>keeping a close eye on that and building that. I think that will be a very important indicator.<br>

<b>Paul Christopher Reilly</b> - Raymond James Financial, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Good afternoon. I'm Paul Reilly. I'm Chairman and CEO of Raymond James. And on behalf of the board, our executive committee, the officers and<br>all of our associates, we'd like to welcome you here to our Raymond James Financial Annual Meeting.<br>
The rules of the procedure were available when you walked in or you entered the room today. The notice of this meeting was contained in our<br>proxy materials that was mailed on January 8, 2018, to our shareholders of record on December 18, 2017.<br>
I'm required to say all this. In accordance with our by-laws, I hereby appoint Jonathan Santelli, our Corporate Secretary, as the meeting's Inspector<br>of Elections. Jonathan, you're somewhere. Oh, you're behind me, good. Got to be careful, then. Jonathan, will you please announce the number<br>of shares present or by -- here or by proxy.<br>
<b>Jonathan N. Santelli</b> - Raymond James Financial, Inc. - Executive VP, General Counsel &amp; Corporate Secretary<br>
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Over 136,562,201 shares of common stock of the company are represented at the meeting, either in person or by proxy,<br>representing more than 93% of the 145,433,833 shares of common stock outstanding on the record date of December 18, 2017. Accordingly, Mr.<br>Chairman, a quorum is present and voting.<br>
<b>Paul Christopher Reilly</b> - Raymond James Financial, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Great, and thank you all. 93% response rate is really good for the shareholders. We appreciate being heard. Because a majority of the outstanding<br>capital stock entitled to vote at the meeting are present or in proxy, I declare a quorum and the meeting has been officially convened. Transacting<br>businesses -- here to transact the business that comes before it, I'm going to call this annual meeting of the shareholders to order.<br>
So the first item is to introduce our Board of Directors. The first one is always the hardest, a good director, but because of his name, Charlie<br>Arentschildt, I got actually a lesson from our corporate securities attorney because he's German, how to say it in German with an accent, but I<br>couldn't pull it off. So Charlie, could you please stand? We're going to have all the directors stand. Charlie was -- has experience in -- have the<br>experience in fixed income with Deutsche Bank and has been a great addition to the board. Shelley Broader, CEO of Chico's and was at Michaels<br>and ran Walmart Canada, brings a lot of retail and operating board experience. Jeff Edwards, Jeff was former CFO of Merrill Lynch, for those who<br>have heard of that little firm, and has a private equity firm doing business in India. Ben Esty, Chair of our Audit Committee. Ben headed the finance<br>department at Harvard Business School when I was a finance professor. He got to get rotated off of that administrative duty, right, and teaches a<br>bunch of classes, so thank you. Bo Godbold, Bo didn't need any introduction. He has been here almost as long as Tom. And Tom's successor once<br>had told Bo, told him he was going to retire. And for Tom's vocabulary, so the first time he ever had to get a dictionary and look up a word, he didn't<br>know what retirement meant. I don't think he still understands the word. Bo, thanks. Our Chairman Emeritus, Tom James. Gordon Johnson, Gordon<br>brings a great banking experience, is on our bank board and our corporate governance committee. Rod McGeary, who I actually worked with at<br>KPMG, has a technology background and has run technology companies and in board in a number of other companies. I am here. Bob Saltzman<br>was not able to attend last minute because of an illness in his family. So we'll remember Bob and his family and our thoughts and prayers today.<br>And Susan Story, from -- CEO of American Water and our lead Director. So thank you all, and welcome.<br>

<A name=223></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, RJF - Raymond James Financial Inc Annual Shareholders Meeting<br>
I'd also like to welcome the KPMG representatives. John Crish, he is the Lead Engagement Partner, and Julie Barba. Julie just made partner.<br>Congratulations, Julie. You now have liability. I'm signing the report now that you're a partner. The representative of KPMG are here to answer any<br>questions during or after the meeting.<br>
So the next area is the proxy review. Now I'll present the proposals included in the proxy for your consideration and then we'll open the floors to<br>question -- the floor to questions. While the proxy votes are collected, I will deliver my Chairman's report, and then I'll introduce Jim Bunn, the<br>Co-Head of our Global Equity Capital Market business, at which he's going to speak about that business, and the newest member of our executive<br>team. I will take a few questions and then close the polls, and then Tom James, our Chairman Emeritus, will speak about current market environment,<br>industry trends and whatever Tom wants to talk about because he will anyway. So that's one of the great things about Tom, whatever's topical,<br>we'll hear about.<br>
There are 3 agenda items set forth. First is the election of the Board of Directors. The board has been nominated following the 11 board members<br>to serve on the company's board until the annual meeting of 2019, and until their successors shall be elected. The proxy statement contains<br>information on the backgrounds and experience of the board members: Charlie, Shelley, Jeff, Ben, Bo, Gordon, Rod, myself, Bob and Susan. So you<br>should have enough material to decide whether they're qualified; we believe they are. Second is to approve the in-advisory non-binding vote of<br>resolution on the company's executive compensation. The shareholders are required by Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection<br>Act to be given the opportunity to vote to cast a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation for 2017. And the third item is to ratify<br>KPMG, LLP as the company's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year 2018. KPMG has served in that capacity since 2001.<br>
Are there any questions or other discussion items regarding the motions proposed? If not, the polls are now open. If you desire a ballot, please<br>raise your hand and one will be delivered to you by the Inspector of Elections. You don't have to vote again if you vote -- if you've already voted,<br>but you can change your vote if you wish. Once you've completed a ballot, please submit it to the Inspector of Elections. Anybody need a ballot?<br>No? Okay.<br>
So I've seen -- you've seen our 2007 (sic) [2017] annual report. I'm going to go make a few remarks. Jim will be next. We'll close the polls and then<br>Tom will speak.<br>
So first, 2017 was a very good year on almost any measure. Our revenue was up 18%, both total revenue and net revenue, over 2016. So it was a<br>very strong revenue year growth, partly by things we did like our recruitment and retaining of advisors, partly because we had a good market that<br>year, but we had a very good revenue production. And when you look to the net income line, it was up 20%, about the same as revenue. And<br>usually you expect positive leverage, but we did have an unusual, hopefully very unusual item, $120 million of legal expenses on a case that year.<br>And some acquisition cost going back to our acquisition of Alex Brown. If we remove those items as an unusual one-time item, we're actually up<br>35% for that year on the bottom line. So the results from a top line and bottom line were very good. And what's really impressive is all 4 major<br>business units had record revenue and record net income even with the charge. So it was a very, very strong year by all the pieces of Raymond<br>James.<br>
That translated in earnings per share. With those items in there, still up 19%, which is certainly great growth. I wish I could tell you we could<br>absolutely do that every year. We hope to, but it's a very, very strong number. And if you add those items back, our earnings per share as adjusted<br>were up 33%. So certainly a strong year. Traditionally, with Raymond James, one of the things we pride ourselves is a strong conservative balance<br>sheet with a equity of $5.6 billion, well-capitalized, which I'll talk about in a little bit. And our market cap, our stock price really rose dramatically,<br>and we had an over $12 billion market cap at the end of the fiscal year.<br>
If you look to the 4 major business units, Private Client Group certainly had a strong growth, 5-year compounded growth rate over 12%, and net<br>income of $373 million was over -- almost a 12%, 11.6% compounded growth rate. And again, the secret of -- a lot of people in the industry talk<br>about our success in the Private Client Group through our recruiting, but we're mostly proud is our regretted attrition is very low. The secret, I think,<br>for Raymond James is made a great -- make it a great place for advisors to do business by the great support our associates give them. They don't<br>leave. They tell everybody else about it and we're able to recruit. And again, we've been on a very good growth rate, and you can see that both in<br>the growth of the advisors on the right, where we added 200 net advisors. Now we have a lot of advisors, a couple of percent a year that get out<br>of the business, retire, ill, some pass away. So you're recruiting to fill that, plus to grow the firm, so the results were outstanding. And certainly, the<br>

impact of recruiting and the market growth got us to $659 billion of client assets. Again, over a 12% growth rate over those 5 years and versus our<br>-- any of our competitors, very, very good result.<br>
Our Capital Markets had a record year, but barely. As you can see, revenue and net income really comprised of 2 pieces. The fixed income market<br>has been very difficult. Its interest rate has been low, and the yield curve, the difference between 1-year, 10-year and 30-year, not very steep. It's<br>been a difficult environment for our fixed income business. Yet, they continue to generate double-digit margins. So they were down a little bit but<br>had very good performance relative to the industry. But our Capital Markets, our equity capital markets, had a very good year and a very strong<br>fourth quarter to end that year, especially in the M&amp;A business. And Jim Bunn will talk about that in a little bit.<br>
So our fixed income business tends to be a counter-cyclical business. When equity markets are good, it tends to be down. And as they say, our --<br>as John Carson, our leader in that area says, you don't want us to have a great year because it means rest of the businesses will be down, which<br>typically happens. So -- but a good contribution by that business. Our Asset Management continues to grow, and our Asset Management business<br>is really comprised of 2 pieces: one is the amount -- the money we manage for our advisors through our various platforms; and the other half is<br>money we manage for outside people in our funds and our investors. So through Carillon Tower associates, whether it will be Eagle, ClariVest,<br>Cougar, or recently joining, Scout and Reams, after this year end. Again, market appreciation, great flow of assets, great results, as we've had over<br>15% growth in revenue and over a 20% compounded growth in the net income of that division.<br>
And last but not least is Raymond James Bank. Raymond James Bank has become a major part of our earnings stream. A very big revenue year.<br>Now in banking, when interest rates start to move up, the revenue moves up. Doesn't mean your profit always moves up in tandem. It depends<br>on the spread, what you earn on your loans versus what you pay out. But their pretax income also had a very strong year. Again, a 12% 5-year<br>growth rate. On the revenues, a little over 11% growth compounded on net income. The bank assets continue to grow, and more importantly, we<br>think the quality of the loans are very good in the bank.<br>
The bank continued diversify its loans this year with tax-exempt loans from highly-rated municipalities becoming a bigger part. Our what we call<br>security-based loans, which are loans which are secured by stock for our Private Client Group clients, also become a bigger, bigger part of the<br>balance sheet. So we've moved from really C&amp;I loans or corporate loans over the last few years to a much more diversified balance sheet across<br>real estate SBA loans, single-family home loans and tax-exempt loans. So we've had very, very good results.<br>
For the first quarter, even though it's past the year-end, just as an update, again, we had very, very good revenue growth as compared to the quarter<br>a year earlier. Again, keeping that pace of around a 16% growth, fueled by really 2 big areas: One is the stock market continued to perform and go<br>up through year-end. But the other factor is, as interest rate starting to rise, we get a significant lift in our bottom line from interest rates. So for<br>every basis point spread we can earn over our cost, it's $4 million of profits. So as rates have been rising, we continue to earn more off that interest<br>spread. And that's become a big driver, which traditionally, up through the financial crisis, was a big part of our earnings. And after the financial<br>crisis it kind of went away for a while, and it's coming back.<br>
Our net income was down 19% over the year-ago quarter, but that was for really one reason, the tax act. We had to take a $117 million charge<br>against deferred tax assets. So things we'd put on the books before, we had to tax-adjust, and you can read companies had billions of dollars of<br>this. We had $117 million, which we'll earn back in the next few quarters. So it's a good thing but a one-time hit. If you took that out, earnings were<br>actually up 35% over the quarter a year ago. So again, if you really look at it adjusted, a very good quarter. And the same on our earnings per share,<br>down 20% if you don't take into account the one-time adjustment, up 33% if you do.<br>
Our balance sheet continues to be very, very strong. Even with the earnings, the equity only went up a little bit from year-end because of that tax<br>charge was a charge to equity, but our earnings stream remains very, very strong. Our stock price, again, was up at the end of the year and our<br>market cap was over $13 billion. So it marked our 120th consecutive quarter of profitability for the firm, which is really a record very few firms can<br>talk about. And even in '09, the worst year in the industry, where most firms lost a lot of money, we had an 8% return on equity. I always point out<br>in March of '09, we barely made a profit but that when I was announced to be Tom's successor. I think it scared everybody. Now when we hit 100<br>consecutive quarters of profitability, I give Tom 100 quarters on stage, and to congratulate him, told him he owed me 1 quarter for every quarter<br>after. He had it give it back to me. So Tom, it's been 20 quarters. You owe me $5 and I'm not going to forget it. But I also told him I hope he was<br>around to get all 100 quarters. I hope I was around to get all 100 quarters.<br>

Our stock has performed exceptionally well on any benchmark. Just forget the dollar amount. We get into the $90 a share range. The growth versus<br>the S&amp;P 500, which we're in now, or versus the Financial Services Index, if you look -- go back over the 5-year change, and we do this every quarter,<br>the graphs look very similar. We outperformed the competition. And this is Tom's favorite slide, which is, if you had bought 200 shares of Raymond<br>James when it went public, you'd have almost $600,000 if you looked at dividend reinvestment, and almost a 17% compounded rate of return.<br>Now I knew Tom in '83. He never told me to buy any shares back then, I wish he had. But very, very successful stock performance of the company.<br>
Return on equity, something we pay attention to, for many years, the firm always looked at trying to earn at least 15% or better as an ROE. And<br>given the industry with no interest rate earnings, we were down double digit but in the lower double digits. Now we outperformed most of our<br>competitors even with the most capital, but we were lower than normal. If you looked at this last quarter with interest rates starting to kick in, you<br>see we have the potential again to be at that 15% level or above, which is really our target in this environment, is that -- to try to get a 15% return<br>on shareholders' equity. So with interest rates coming back, hopefully we'll be able to start, longer term, closing back on that goal.<br>
Now we had a lot of success over the last -- throughout our history. And most recently there's a lot of press on us, whether it's a big investment<br>banking deal, like Mobileye, our profits, Moody's upgrading us, joining the S&amp;P 500, which is really an honor. To me, the biggest honor this year<br>was S&amp;P upgraded us. And our credit rating is the same as Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. And it's really quite a story that<br>a company of this size could really be recognized, and a company here in the financial capital of the world, St. Petersburg, Florida. So it's a testament<br>to Bob and Tom and Bo and a lot of people, Dick Averitt's in the room, people that really helped build this company, to allow us to get the point<br>where we could achieve those types of successes, and mainly through organic growth.<br>
Now in the last few years, we've had a few acquisitions too. We've been very opportunistic with a number of strategic acquisitions, Morgan Keegan<br>being the largest, where we had about $1 billion event where the Morgan Keegan family joined us. It's been great. They've been great for our<br>business. It's continued to help us spring our fixed income business. Our public finance business went from #24 to #8. We have great financial<br>advisors, and we've seemed to been able to pick very good strategic acquisitions like 3Macs, which is a 200-year old firm in Montr�al that allowed<br>us to had French and compete in Eastern Canada and the Qu�bec province. Scout and Reams joined us this year. Alex Brown, where we've gotten<br>a lot of press, where we've been able to increase our penetration in the Northeast and really show that we are in the ultra-high net worth business<br>also. So there's been a lot of success. But as we look at that, we remind ourselves that the average period of time for a company to be in the S&amp;P<br>gets shorter and shorter and shorter.<br>
Lot of companies succeed, but can't continue to be successful through long periods of time. So it's great to appreciate what we've accomplished<br>and the work we've done, but we can never forget that we're not automatically allowed in this position. We have to earn it every year. And the<br>focus has always been first is on our values, people. We have great people that really make this firm work and the focus of our clients. Client-first<br>focus, the philosophy I think has kept us out of trouble in times of '09 and it's kept us growing as people and advisors and others joined us because<br>they know we truly care about clients. So the core values that have been in this business really, forever, we need to keep the focus. Now we need<br>to evolve as the industry evolves, competition evolves, regulation evolves, but we got to keep focused on who we are and why really people are<br>here because they know we're here to take care of clients.<br>
With that, we still have a conservative balance sheet, something the analyst community gives us a hard time about. They think we have too much<br>capital. We don't. We use capital to do those strategic acquisitions, but we also want to be conservative because there will be another '09 of some<br>type, maybe not as bad, hopefully, but we know there'll be downturns and we want to have cash. Our cash was only a little over $900 million today,<br>so -- but we keep around $1 billion of cash for liquidity. And our focus is been, as Tom always been is, how do we grow smart? Because we grow<br>smart and profitably, you can invest those profits into people, into technology. If you get good people, good technology, good products, you can<br>improve your business. That helps fuel growth. If you don't, the opposite happens. If you can't grow and your margins are shrinking, you stop<br>investing. Then you start losing people. They don't have opportunities. So we gotta say, how do we grow smartly long term? And it has to be smart.<br>We look at the opportunities we have and the risks. So at our off-site, our Board has asked us to look at a few things. First is to focus on not just the<br>growth, but the risk management parts of our business. We've continued to invest a lot in technology and how technology interacts with people.<br>So we need to keep doing that, but they asked us to look at some specific kind of long-term things that are impacting our business. The movement<br>of active to passive or from high-cost funds to low-cost funds has an impact on our profitability. So whether we argue active or passive is good for<br>clients, not for clients, we're not going to get through that. We understand there's a trend. And how does it impact us? And how are we going to<br>deal with it? They also asked us to look at our kind of noncore businesses and services, we have a lot of them, not get rid of businesses, but to say,<br>

are they substantial enough to take the risks that you're taking? And they -- are they profitable enough for you to pay attention to? So we're going<br>to take them through the screen of some 70 kind of products and services on the off-site, and I know our board, we will be very, very challenged.<br>And we're also going to talk about our diversity and inclusion, as we continue to grow and is to make sure this is a safe place for all people to work.<br>And they've asked us to present kind of our diversity and inclusion efforts, where we are, what we need to accomplish? So -- and last but not least,<br>Sunday, we go over succession planning. It's not that everyone is planning to leave, it's that we've done this for years now, and Sunday, and our<br>board retreats as we go over every position starting from mine on down and to say who is the successor? Are they ready? Are we training them<br>properly? Are they going to be ready for the position? Who's going to take their jobs if they move up to the next job? And it's really, really a great<br>exercise. Because at the end of the day, the success of the firm is by all the great people and leaders. So maybe excluding Tom and I in the top left<br>there, we've got a great executive committee. They're very focused, very dedicated, they've driven this business for a long time. Some people like<br>Jeff Trocin, who has been here -- running his business for over 25 years; Dennis Zank, both have been working on their succession plans; Jeff now<br>co-heading it with Jim Bunn; Dennis really working with Scott and Tash and those changes in developing them. You know really have contributed<br>long term to the firm. And they want to make sure, not that they're going anywhere now, but they want to make sure that when they do, or when<br>I leave, or anybody else, the firm's in good hands. So we have a great team of people. Maybe the most -- the nicest accolade we got was actually<br>in the Wall Street Journal, you don't expect to get it in the press, and that's Jeff Julien, who was honored as the longest-serving CFO of any Fortune<br>500 or S&amp;P 500 company.<br>
And so the title is, finance chiefs are staying longer in the job, and that's good for companies. And that's because this is the profits over just 30-year<br>tenure.<br>
So I'm sorry to say, if you think Jeff can retire, he needs another 30 years just to keep this chart going someday. So Jeff, you're -- we're going to keep<br>you here for a long time. With that, it's a great firm, built on great values, built on great -- built on a solid financial platform. It's an honor to be here.<br>It's -- I hated to be the first James -- non-James to open up the shareholder meeting, right. Yes, I can change my name. So I get in the world too<br>then.<br>
So thank you all for attending, and I'd like you now to give a warm welcome to Jim Bunn. Jim came with us in the Lane Berry acquisition and has<br>worked his way through our equity capital markets on the M&amp;A side. He was an outstanding M&amp;A professional, really grew that business, took over<br>and now he's co-head -- co-heading with Jeff. So Jim, come on up and...<br>
<b>James E. Bunn</b> - Raymond James Financial, Inc. - Co-President of Global Equities &amp; Investment Banking - Raymond James &amp; Associates Inc<br>
My first name is James, so if that -- that's me. I'll take what I can get. I'll also note that when Paul commented on a record year, he caveated by saying<br>barely a record year and I would just want to point out that when they study the record books and say, for example, who's the all-time winning as<br>quarterback in Super Bowl victories, Tom Brady would show up. He's barely the leader with 5 over couple of guys with 4. But he's still the #1. So<br>the record books don't always denote barely. And for those wondering if I'd work in a Patriots with Tom Brady reference into the presentation and<br>all, there you go. I'm Jim -- go pass. I'm Jim Bunn. I co-head our Global Equity Capital Markets business or as we often refer it to an internally equities<br>in Investment Banking. As Paul mentioned, I joined the firm in 2009 through the acquisition of Lane Berry. It was a Boston-based M&amp;A advisory<br>firm. It was a, I think by all measures, a tremendous success. Almost all of the senior folks from that firm who were with me as part of the team when<br>I joined the firm, are all still here and many have assumed leadership positions and found this to be just an absolute fantastic company to work for,<br>and there's been a lot of growth that I'll talk about over the time period. So it's been a pretty exciting period and I was part of the best thing that<br>could have happened to our firm was to be acquired by Raymond James coming up on 9 years ago. It's hard to believe it's been that long time,<br>time flies. I will talk about our Capital Markets businesses and in particular our Equities and Investment Banking business, or ECM business. That<br>business has shown very strong growth over the last 5 years on the revenue line and even stronger growth on the earnings side. Revenues have<br>exceeded $1 billion in each of the last 2 years, fiscal '16 and fiscal '17. Both records, both all-time highs. And earnings have grown faster than<br>revenues because our margins have been expanding. The margin in our Capital Markets business has reached 13.9%, almost 14% in fiscal '17. And<br>that compares to 9.4% back in '12 and 11% in '13. So together with that revenue growth has been some pretty strong expansion in our margins.<br>
If you look at the constituent parts of what makes up our Capital Markets businesses, it's a pretty balanced business overall. ECM represents just<br>over half firm-wide Capital Markets revenues last year. Fixed Income is about 40% and our Tax Credit Funds business is about 7.5%. If you look from<br>'16 to '17, you can see that North American and European ECM revenues grew pretty strongly. That was offset by some declines in our Fixed Income<br>

and Tax Credit Funds businesses. To some extent, the growth rates of those businesses tend to offset each other. Net revenues related to our Latin<br>American joint ventures were lower. We sold our interest in those in early 2017, that affected the overall top line. And the result of all that is, overall,<br>roughly flattish Capital Markets revenues, but with a mix shift towards U.S. and European ECM revenues.<br>
In the U.S. and Europe, ECM revenues reached $464 million in 2017. That was a 27% increase over 2016 and a record revenue level. I'm fortunate<br>to be able to stand here and present the results after such a terrific year. From 2012 to 2017, our ECM revenues have increased at a compound<br>annual growth rate of over 10%. And the growth in 2017 did follow declines in each of 2015 and 2016. Each of -- our ECM revenues are made up<br>of several different business lines and advisory business and underwriting business, sales and trading business. Each of those businesses have their<br>own growth profiles and trajectories, opportunities and challenges, and I'm going to detail some of those over the next several slides.<br>
The most significant catalyst for our recent growth in ECM has been the Investment Banking business. Since 2012, those revenues have almost<br>doubled, that's a CAGR of more than 14%. Revenues grew by almost 50% in 2017, the biggest growth year we've ever experienced. Within the<br>Investment Banking business, we have a pretty diversified franchise. We've got a presence and a focus across really 9 sectors as we organize<br>ourselves: technology, financial services, healthcare, industrials, real estate, consumer, transportation, and the defense and government services<br>business. And our bankers in each one of those 9 industry groups are supported by product group experts in several areas: M&amp;A, public equities,<br>debt, private capital solutions, restructuring, and a team that covers financial sponsors exclusively, which is a really important client constituency<br>for us that I'm going to talk a little bit more about later.<br>
The biggest driver of all that growth in Investment Banking has been our M&amp;A and advisory business. Specifically in the U.S, that business almost<br>tripled in size over the last 5 years. It's grown from $80 million in 2012 to almost $230 million in 2017. That's a 23% compound annual growth rate.<br>
M&amp;A and advisory made up more than 75% of our Investment Banking revenue attributed to ECM in 2017, less than 25% came from underwriting.<br>My guess is that's probably a little bit of surprising fact to some of the folks in the room and some of the people who've known Raymond James<br>for a long time, who probably perceive that our Investment Banking business would be very Capital Markets underwriting driven. But that would<br>mask the fact that over the last several years, we built a very strong advisory business with a great reputation and doing bigger and bigger and<br>more prominent transactions, particularly over the last 5 to 7 years.<br>
That growth has really been the result of a focus on developing and recruiting M&amp;A and advisory-oriented bankers to the firm and then successfully<br>completing larger transactions with larger fees, creating productivity gains. The number of transactions that we worked on with a fee of over $1<br>million has grown from 25 such transactions in 2012 to 66 in 2017. And our average M&amp;A fee per completed transaction has grown from $1.2 million<br>in 2012 to $1.6 million in 2017, and this demonstrated pretty consistent year-to-year growth over that time frame.<br>
We worked on several transactions last year that were notable for a few reasons: one, their size, as multi-hundred million dollar valued transactions<br>like the sale of ECA compliance, which is a portfolio company of a private equity firm, New Mountain Capital, to Starr Investment Holdings; the sale<br>of the business for global cash card to ADP transaction values which of those don't appear in the slides because they weren't publicly disclosed,<br>but each of those were north of $500 million transactions. They were very large deals. Secondly, a number of these are prominent for their significance<br>within the industries in which they occurred. Paul mentioned a Mobileye transaction earlier, that be the single largest transaction we've ever advised<br>on, period, much less as the sole advisor to the company. That was a $15 billion transaction. Mobileye was a leader in autonomous driving technology.<br>Business was acquired by Intel. Another good example is our work for Roadrunner Transportation Systems, a public company, where we led a $540<br>million recapitalization for that business by Elliott Management. And I see a couple of members of the banking team, who worked on that, actually<br>in the audience. Lastly, some of these are notable for our representation of significant public companies in large and important transactions on<br>their behalf. Good examples are the sale of Datalink. It's a publicly traded technology company and their sale to Insight; the merger of United<br>Insurance with American Coastal Insurance; and the sale of Sage's Payment Solutions business, Sage being a public software company, to GTCR,<br>which is a very prominent Chicago-based private equity firm. So lot more transactions in these we were proud of but just a few that are kind of<br>notable for some of the key things that we focus on.<br>
All that said about our advisory business, our underwriting franchise is very strong too. And importantly, when you -- we look at revenues between<br>advisory and underwriting, it's important to note that only a portion of the ultimate -- the total underwriting fees that we earn at the firm get<br>booked to Investment Banking, others get booked to private client depending on how the deal was distributed. Our underwriting transaction<br>

volume has been less consistent within our advisory business that largely reflects the higher degree of year-to-year variance in industry-wide IPO<br>and follow-on activity. Our revenues in activity tends to follow what's happening in the broader market. We did complete 109 underwritings last<br>year. That's up pretty significantly from 2016, which was a very slow year in the IPO and follow-on markets, in particular, for some of our -- historically<br>very strong underwriting sectors like oil and gas and like real estate. But still last year was down from the peak levels that we experienced in 2013<br>to 2015. One area where we have been successful in growing our role is in growing our role on the transactions on which we participate. We were<br>a bookrunner or a lead manager on 52% of our transactions in '16, 47% in '17. That compares to roughly 30% to 40% in the '12, '14 and '15 time<br>frame. So we've been able to consistently move up the ranks, if you will, and command greater positions and greater economics on our transactions.<br>All that has led to increasing recognition in the industry for Raymond James and our standing in the Investment Banking community. I won't detail<br>all of these awards, but they're bestowed upon us in the investment banker's version of the Oscars which -- there's a few of those that we take place<br>in every year. And we're very proud of a number of the awards we've won, whether it be cross-border deal of the year between $500 million and<br>$1 billion, financial services deal of the year, divestiture of the year. Some of our investment bankers have won -- young and upcoming investment<br>bankers have won Emerging Professional of the Year type of awards. We've won firm of the year award. So we're really proud of this.<br>
One of the most important initiatives that we've undertaken in the last few years has been the expansion of our Investment Banking business and<br>specifically our advisory business overseas to Europe and the U.K. A couple of years ago in this meeting, my partner, Jeff Trocin, described our<br>intent to expand to Europe and the importance of that had on bolstering our cross-border capabilities and continuing our track record of growth<br>and success in winning important M&amp;A mandates.<br>
At that point in time, we were in amidst of a pretty comprehensive review of what are all of our organic and inorganic opportunities to expand<br>into Europe. And at the end of that, we acquired a Munich, Germany-based business called Mummert &amp; Company that occurred in June of 2016.<br>We have known the Mummert team for quite some period of time. There was some kind of activity between some of our senior professionals and<br>their founder, Mel Mummert, and we had the opportunity in late '15 and early '16 to work collaboratively with them on a transaction, German-based<br>company, where we brought domain expertise from our U.S. teams. We had a great experience. We got the transaction done and completed very<br>successfully. We found that we worked very well together, had a similar approach to the business and style and that led us to conclude that they<br>were the right partner with us. And they -- more importantly, they shared our ambition to build a leading middle market advisory business in<br>Europe. Since that acquisition, which is now about 19 months ago, we've more than doubled the scale of our European Investment Banking business.<br>We've grown MD headcount from 6 at the time of the acquisition to 14 today. We've created an advisory board. 8 senior executives, all CEOs or<br>former CEOs from the industries in which we operate. Really designed to kind of expand our network and help keeping our industry expertise and<br>our ability to compete and win and get to the right levels within the corporations that we're trying to reach. We opened a Frankfurt office in October.<br>Really, Frankfurt is a closer and more of a financial hub for the private equity firms that brought us closer to the private equity community, and a<br>couple bankers opened there. We have deep domain expertise, and then we followed that shortly by opening our London office. London focused<br>specifically on technology. London is really a hub for investment banker engagement decisions for U.K.-based companies and really leverages our<br>strength in technology M&amp;A in the U.S. and in Europe. That was a core focus of Mummert. So our European Investment Banking business is focused<br>on fewer industries than is our business in the United States, and that really reflects the areas where cross-border M&amp;A activity is the highest. So<br>in Europe, we're focused on technology. That's our largest industry vertical there, consumer, healthcare and industrials.<br>
The tougher part of our overall ECM business for the last 5 years has been the institutional commission side of the business. This was actually the<br>part of the business that grew the fastest after ECM was formed in 1996. These figures reflect the totality of our global ECM commissions. The<br>majority of this is U.S. equities, but this also includes Canada, Europe and Latin America. It's been a very challenging environment for the last several<br>years. Industry data shows that the total U.S. institutional commission lot has come down 40% roughly from the peak in 2009. That's really because<br>of several factors: one, lower volatility, that's changed a little bit recently. But generally speaking, for last several years, lower volatility, which results<br>in lower trading volumes.<br>
Two, profitability pressures on the investment management industry as a result of the shift from active to passive management that in turn affects<br>their ability to spend on research with sell-side providers, such as ourselves. Three, competitive factors causing a compression in commission rates.<br>And lastly, a pending regulation that's affecting Europe, but it's going to have an impact on this business in the U.S. called MiFID II. And a lot of<br>investment managers started to reduce their research spend in advance with that to start to prepare.<br>

<A name=229></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, RJF - Raymond James Financial Inc Annual Shareholders Meeting<br>
So revenues of $223 million were down approximately 3% from 2012, and revenues declined in each of the last 3 years. It's important to note that<br>the revenues reflected here do include a portion of our underwriting fees. So when you look at the revenue levels in '13 and '15, those do include<br>the underwriting -- portion of the underwriting revenues in those years, and those were stronger overall underwriting environment in those years.<br>So on this side of the business, we're carefully monitoring our investments. We're intensely focused on gaining market share at the expense of our<br>competitors. We're committed to a very high-quality team that's positioned to grow our market share with key accounts and really leverages this<br>business more than any of our others, leverages our world-class equity research product. And that's a great product.<br>
Our research team is very, very highly regarded globally. We have almost 80 senior research analysts that cover 1,300 public companies. That's a<br>top 3 footprint in terms of covered companies by equity research amongst all firms, inclusive of the bulge firms. And as you can note from the<br>some of the commentary in the awards bestowed upon our research department on the left-hand side of the slide, the industry services and<br>consultants all rank Raymond James as one of the top research teams in our industry, inclusive of the bulge bracket and global bank competitors.<br>This is particularly true within our market focus, which are growth industries, growth companies and small and mid-cap and the investors who<br>invest in those companies.<br>
So I'll wrap up and talk about some of the growth initiatives that we have in place to continue to drive the type of growth we've enjoyed over the<br>last several years in ECM. In the advisory business, we're intensely focused on improving our core operating metrics. Those metrics being deal and<br>fee sizes and productivity, as we measure by revenue per managing director and revenue per banker. I mentioned that we've grown our MD and<br>banker headcount in Europe quite a bit since the Mummert acquisition in 2018, and we expect that headcount growth to yield revenue growth in<br>that business this year and next that will meaningfully benefit us. We're always focused on attracting and retaining and developing advisory-focused<br>bankers to the firm. And within every one of our industry and product groups, we have identified opportunities to develop or add senior bankers<br>to continue to grow those businesses.<br>
Mandates for private equity firms and their portfolio companies make up about half of our advisory business. And we focus very intensively on<br>covering those firms whose investment footprint matches up very well with our industry coverage footprint and we invest in size of companies<br>that we tend to focus on when we tend to be successful. A new initiative we have underway is the formation of a leverage finance capability that's<br>particularly valued by private equity firms that should allow us to deepen our ties and our relationships with the number of our most important<br>private equity firm clients. At the same time, we're very focused on growing our public company advisory practice, as those generally represent<br>larger transactions. To help grow that practice and really reflecting a trend we've noted towards increasing prevalence of investor activism in middle<br>market companies and, in particular, within our research footprint, we formed a team a little over 1 year ago, we call the Activism Response &amp;<br>Contested Situations team, or ARCS, to focus on advising public companies that are either under attack or have the potential to be attacked by<br>activist investors. Right at the shoot in the first half of 2017, Thomson Reuters ranked us as the #2 activism defense advisor globally. So we were<br>thrilled to get such an award so quickly after starting the practice.<br>
And then looking more globally, I've talked about Europe, and we've also completed several transactions between Chinese and Asian buyers and<br>investors and companies or our clients in the U.S. and Europe. We expect such activity to grow in volume and importance in the middle market, in<br>particular, and we're not planning or anticipating putting a big team on the ground in Asia at any point soon. We did add a banker to our European<br>team, native Chinese, focused on facilitating cross-border deal flow between the U.S. and China, and we expect to add a similar resource in the<br>U.S. in a hope to help us expand that business more broadly across Asia.<br>
In the underwriting business, we expanded into the Life Sciences business in 2015. We're pleased with the progress we've made in the first couple<br>of years of that practice. The Life Sciences market is very important. It's 15% to 20% of the entire underwriting -- U.S. equity underwriting wallet in<br>most years. And so we have a lot of opportunity to continue to grow that practice. So we're very focused on expanding our team on both the<br>banking and the research side of the house to capture a greater share of that enormous market. In other sectors -- underwriting sectors which are<br>real historical strengths for Raymond James, oil and gas, real estate, financial services, technology, we're continuing to focus on increasing our<br>share of the target transaction fees noting that an increase in percentage of the activity within many of those sectors is in the form of large bought<br>deal formats, which is generally not actually in our focus because of the: A, generally lower profitability and; b, higher risk associated with those<br>transactions. We'll do them selectively but a number of them that we've seen in our footprint have been multi-hundred million dollar deals, which<br>we tend not to have the appetite for.<br>

Within research, sales and trading, the New York hedge fund market and the middle market or smaller investment managers represent core growth<br>opportunities for us. We're focusing our resources to capitalize on those opportunities. MiFID II will represent a significant headwind this year in<br>Europe, and we expect that to affect our U.S. equities business this year and next as well. We're monitoring that pretty closely and we will respond.<br>One of the things we'll be seeking to do in a post-MiFID world, as we refer to it, is to add new types of differentiated research different from the<br>traditional industry-oriented research. We recently added, as an example, a Public Policy Analyst to our team, and that analyst has already been<br>hugely impactful at a number of our largest and most important accounts. So I would expect to see us to continue to look for differentiated<br>opportunities to grow our research practice and expand our research focus along those lines.<br>
So with that, I'll be happy to take any questions at the end of the meeting, and I will turn the podium over.<br>
<b>Paul Christopher Reilly</b> - Raymond James Financial, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
So as a Notre Dame grad, it's hard for me to say anything good about a Michigan grad except Jim's done an outstanding job in transitioning with<br>Jeff Trocin. Of course, you're a Miami grad. Is that an upgrade? I'm not sure. So we have all these football rivalries. I've been on the losing end of all<br>of them but that's all right. So I will now open up for questions from the audience. Please raise your hand if you have a question about any of the<br>items on the proxy statement. If you have general questions, we'll also be around after the meeting, you can ask us. But if there are any questions<br>that you want to bring before, please raise your hand.<br>
Last chance.<br>
Having no questions, we will close the question period. And I will now ask the inspector of elections to collect any outstanding ballots. I don't think<br>anyone has any ballots. Are there any ballots present? Looks like not.<br>
So I declare the voting closed. And the polls are closed. The inspector of the election will count the ballots, and while he does that, although I don't<br>think he has a lot of counting to do right now, we're going to ask Tom James to come up and speak. So, Tom?<br>
<b>Thomas Alan James</b> - Raymond James Financial, Inc. - Chairman Emeritus<br>
Thank you, Paul. I'll turn myself on. I think Paul thought since I turned over this chairmanship a year ago that I might have postpartum depression<br>if I didn't have the chance to get up in front of the group and talk, which I'm prone to do. So I thought I would deal with some subjects that ought<br>to be of interest to investors as well as employees of the firm that we don't normally talk about. But I did want to make a comment about Jim<br>because Jim is a member of the team of people who have joined us, who are a younger management group from a different generation, and<br>certainly I am, and maybe even Paul in some cases. But I think you can tell that he has excellent capability which, of course, was honed by his<br>association with Jeff Trocin over these 9 years. But he's a terrific M&amp;A banker himself before he managed this effort, and you can see that he has a<br>good grasp of a business that you may not have thought was nearly as important to our firm as it is. I mean, the fact is all of those core groups that<br>you saw listed in Paul's presentation were -- are very important to the firm. They all have different interrelationships with each other. But more<br>importantly, they serve new complements of clients for us to serve. And our old words are that our business is you, and your financial well-being<br>applies not just to individual clients but applies to corporate clients, it applies to institutional clients. You heard about ECM equity clients here. If<br>you heard from our other half in Fixed Income and Public Finance, you would be equally impressed with their ability to operate in a time frame<br>that has been very difficult for Fixed Income because rates are so low. I mean, it's not a very attractive alternative for a lot of people to own when<br>the old dictum was you need to be 60% equity and 40% debt. And there are a lot of us who have found other ways on the equity side to replace<br>debt because it wasn't very attractive to own. And if the current Fed activity is included, we may well find ourselves back in a position with more<br>balance in sometime in the not too distant future. Although, clearly, the Fed has not been quick to draw the gun to raise rates. They're being very<br>careful in terms of their lift. So what I would encourage everybody to do. This are big document, somewhat foreboding, I would tell you. This is<br>typical of most annual reports, except that we have a lot more detail than your average public company does. Many companies today give you a<br>10-K, which, to be frank, is so complex, so many pages that you really have to be an analyst to understand it or a CPA to interpret the financial<br>results. And so what we try to do is tell you what the company is really doing between this shareholders' report and the part of the document that<br>precedes the 10-K. And so I want to make a plea to all of you that when you own companies, if you ever talk to those companies, many of them<br>

just send out the 10-K with a one sheet of shareholder report, which you'll find difficult to finding any facts in of value to your assessment of the<br>company. And it's -- one of the most important communication vehicles for a corporation to discuss how well it's doing, what it plans to do tomorrow,<br>you heard both Paul and Jim talk about some of these factors going forward, and that's what makes companies different. So I just want to make<br>sure that you've think a little bit about those kinds of things and read the shareholder report because there's a lot of information in there in that<br>couple of pages. And you can see in chart form, as you saw on the presentation, a lot of detail. But in this annual report, for example, you can see<br>reports from all of our major departments that enable you to understand some of these segments for business. And it's key, I think, for those of<br>you that invest. And I would tell you, one of the things Jim didn't mention about new issue business being done as levels that have dropped off is<br>one of the key causes is that we in the industry for good reason have tried to increase diversification through offerings of packaged products and<br>there's less focus today on individual stocks. And I would tell you, I regret the complement of having reduced individual stock business because<br>that's one of the things that, I think, makes our free enterprise work better. And the fact is that it's fun. If you're an investor and you spend time on<br>individual securities, don't have to be serious part of your investment at all, could be a small portion of your investment. But you can have a lot of<br>fun doing that individual stock investment. And when you do that, the house odds are in your favor unlike Las Vegas. So you can essentially have<br>your fun and end that with more cash in your pocket, which is not the normal rule in Las Vegas. Now you will notice here, I tried to stop this. I love<br>this photograph, by the way. I've had this photograph for a long time, needless to say, with my father. And all it does is remind me now of how old<br>I've grown. It's kind of like looking in the mirror in the morning only and in the adverse side when both my father and I were young and had a lot<br>more energy, a lot -- but it is important, I think, that you recognize what Paul always focuses on when he gives presentations to our employees,<br>not just our shareholders, is that he focuses on core values. And core values are what has remained constant overall these years and a very important<br>thing. So when you read these documents, there's a lot more to see than just the comparison between the last year and this year's results. As a<br>matter of fact, I would point you in your reading of this document and that first section on Page 22 and 23, there's a 10 year history, maybe the<br>next -- yes, there it is, you did it for me. That's very nice. I appreciate that. I have a hard time pushing buttons. I even have a hard time closing buttons<br>in my shirt. It's getting harder, this stuff. Now this is the short form of what you'll find in the annual report. There aren't as many horizontal numbers<br>that you can trend over this 10 years. This was not the best choice of first year for comparison in 10 years because if you remember, we had the<br>decline in '08 and a further decline through the first quarter of '09 and we hadn't recovered by the end of the fiscal year for us in September of '09.<br>And so actually, revenues declined during that picture. And yet for that time frame, we had a calculated growth -- a compound rate of growth,<br>average rate of growth during that period at 7.7%, but 9.3% net revenues. So that it was reasonably good growth for corporate America, I would<br>tell you. If you look at that S&amp;P 500, they have a hard time with growth at those kinds of rates, and net income match that during the period but<br>only because of the ramp-up at the end. And I would tell you if you went back to the beginning, you would see that -- Jeff is that for me, no. The...<br>
<b>Jeffrey E. Trocin</b> - Raymond James Financial, Inc. - Co-President of Global Equities &amp; Investment Banking of Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc<br>
Your house is on fire.<br>
<b>Thomas Alan James</b> - Raymond James Financial, Inc. - Chairman Emeritus<br>
Yes. So -- well, at least, Mary's safe. She's here. The -- so what I would tell you is that if you want that before this time, which probably only Bo and<br>I remember, Jeff remembers some of that, the fact is that we -- and Dennis certainly remembers, that these numbers were faster growth. And part<br>of that is the natural function of growing a little slower when the organization gets bigger because you have a lot more to deal with and it's hard<br>to create new products, if you will, new services, et cetera, at a rate that affect the base as much as you could when the company was new. And<br>that's why we're always trying to find new people like Jim that can put a little fire under the growth rate. But any measure here, if you look at it, the<br>numbers have grown consistently. We always say we're conservative. We actually have a good growth rate and we have probably one of the highest<br>returns over this time frame over the last 10 over this time frame since we weren't public that he showed you for stock performance. There's the<br>reason that $2,800 grows to $600,000 which was -- were those numbers that we always show you. And that's just for 200 shares of stock which has<br>been a good thing, I would say, personally. But there are reasons why this corporation has done well. And I want to talk about one other, it's very<br>important to those of you that like to buy stocks and that's quality of earnings because earnings are a thing that everybody thinks when you get<br>numbers, there's only one way to present, nothing could be further from the truth. Actually, when you think about the quality of numbers you look<br>at, you see today mostly non-GAAP earnings that are reported, which means that there are adjustments made the way we did last year. But in 2017,<br>the one we had was a one-type event. There are always a few of those every year, so it's hard to say you never have and you just don't have that<br>big is what I would tell you on that particular adjustment that Paul mentioned. But the rest of the time, we're kind of a GAAP reporter, and we do<br>

<A name=232></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, RJF - Raymond James Financial Inc Annual Shareholders Meeting<br>
that because we're conservative in laying out the numbers. And so it's extremely important, I would tell you, that the numbers you read are reliable<br>and comparable to other companies so that you really know how to make comparisons. And when Jim talked about quality, I personally have<br>recommended our research staff, they spend a lot more time looking at quality of earnings just to add value to those -- to whom they report because<br>these GAAP adjustments, which include things like paying your employees in stock and then adding that back to earnings. I mean, that's real<br>money. You're giving them stock but it has a value, and if effectively you have the cash to do it admittedly but you're causing dilution to your<br>existing shareholders and nobody wants to talk about that as being a real cost. It is a real cost. And when you see people focus just on EBITDA, that<br>famous list of -- which is a way we all track something close to operating earnings, the fact is that you can't really go by just one measurement. You<br>have to look at a series of measurements and one just as important that you never see is free cash flow, which, I would tell you, subtracts out your<br>capital investment from those earnings to show you how much cash you have you can actually add to the bank account that year to invest in other<br>activities. And very important how much cash flow you generate. We happen to had -- we had one small offering back in Morgan Keegan day of<br>equity and we did some debt and we added debt to the balance sheet. We haven't really grown that equity except by retained the earnings by<br>and large, and we've used that cash to fund all those acquisitions in addition to the organic purchases of new -- of -- I mean, in addition to the<br>purchases of companies or acquisitions that we add to the company. So it comes from both growing internally and growing by acquisition, which<br>becomes harder the bigger you get if you stay in narrow field of business. We're in the financial services business and even if we didn't want to be<br>in the financial services business, the Fed would say to us, you need to be in the financial services business because they don't want anybody that<br>has to be money-good losing money in other activities. So I think it's important that you understand that from our standpoint because we have a<br>lot of regulation by many regulators to ensure that our business is fiscally sound, and we have to have a lot of liquidity. So Paul added just to handle<br>all these transactions every day that we handle. So earnings quality is a very important thing. And when you see these reports by the CNBC heads<br>that they beat the analyst estimates, do you realize that, that might have been an analyst estimate that was updated 2 weeks early -- earlier and<br>not the analyst estimate at the beginning of the year for that company's results. It's not really an important comparison. The most important<br>comparison for you to look at is historical comparisons, the year-to-year comparison. Sure, you can compare to the prior quarter or prior quarters,<br>but the fact is, if you do that, you've got seasonality and a lot of other factors that enter in -- that make those less reliable indicators of long-term<br>growth. So I really think it's hard to believe all this gets to be fun when you talk about this much of detail and confusion that can happen but when<br>you're investing serious money, you ought to have a serious interest in what you're investing in. So we believe that we try to help clients make the<br>right decisions in these things but it isn't all easy.<br>
Now I want to talk a little bit about share buybacks because you hear a lot about that on CNBC too. And essentially, it's important in a sense that<br>buybacks indicate there's demand for stock, and if you have future demand, there's a more opportunity the stock will go up than if there is no<br>interest in buying stock. And if the company is adding to the third-party market to buy back stock, there are potential buyers of the stock. The --<br>you can't really look at a corporation and say that you're furthering its mission by buying back stock. I mean, you're in business in a corporation<br>that's public to make more money for your shareholders through following your chosen business activity and doing it the right way, serving your<br>clients and earning their business every year going forward. When you're looking to buy companies and part of that activity is some years, there<br>aren't any that you would buy. So you can't feel pressure to do that. You can't feel pressure on this quarterly earnings comparison stuff, especially<br>in our industry when the market action has such a large impact on overall results. Our individuals start commission activity was up 2.5x when we<br>had this recent core action which -- that's fairly a large change from some volatility occurring in the market. So what I would tell you is it's important<br>that you take the long-term view, hence, look at those 10-year type numbers, look at 5-year earnings, don't think about just -- and listen to what<br>people say about the plans for going forward. Are those companies that kinds of companies you want to own? It is true that you will increase<br>earnings per share when you buy stock back because there are less shares to divide by. But let me tell you, if you buy another company at a much<br>higher ROE on your investment or even invest in your existing businesses for equipment, for people, for all the things that you have to invest in<br>every day, as we do in financial advisors, one of our biggest investments is recruiting, the fact is that return, if you retain your people like we do, is<br>terrific. So those are the things you have to think about when you're a board member. And one of the things I wanted to do here is thank the<br>employees who are in the room, members of the executive committee who aren't directors, and say thank you. Because this year doesn't happen<br>with 1 year's effort. I can tell you that. It's earned over a long period of time. And they are doing a terrific job and our directors understand our<br>business. And if you look today at what it takes to be a public company director, it's like night and day from a decade ago, much less when we went<br>public in 1983. So they do a lot of work, and what are we doing? He's talking about this meeting we're going to. It starts tonight and finishes on<br>Sunday afternoon. So we're not just doing a board meeting tomorrow morning and partying. We have a lot of work to get done over the next few<br>days, and dealing with the subjects that were pointed out to you by Paul is no small task, I can tell you. And that's what makes this company better<br>because our directors take serious interest in this. We hire the kind of people who will debate, criticize, complain, but all with the direction of<br>improving the corporate actions, so that we deliver better results. So I really want to thank all of you also who are shareholders. Many of you were<br>

Good morning. My name is Ginger, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Brookdale<br>Senior Living Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)<br>
Mr. Ross Roadman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.<br>
<b>Ross C. Roadman</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - SVP of IR<br>
Thank you, Ginger, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you all to the fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings call for Brookdale<br>Senior Living. Joining us today are Cindy Baier, our Chief Financial Officer; and Lee Wielansky, a member of our Board of Directors.<br>
As we announced this morning, our Board of Directors appointed Cindy as our President and Chief Executive Officer and as a Director effective<br>February 28, to succeed Andy Smith. We also announced that Lee has been elected to serve as Non-Executive Chair. I'd also like to introduce Kathy<br>MacDonald, who is taking over as our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Kathy is an experienced Investor Relations professional who came<br>to us from Mead Johnson Nutrition and has been working with me here for several months. I am transitioning to another position within the<br>company, with the goal of helping to advance the plan that Cindy will talk about today.<br>
I would like to point out that all statements today, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the<br>meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are made as of today's date and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking<br>statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results and performance may differ materially from the estimates or expectations<br>expressed in those statements. Future events could render the forward-looking statements untrue, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to<br>update earlier statements. Certain other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are detailed in the earnings<br>release we issued this morning, as well as in the reports we filed with the SEC from time to time, including the risk factors contained in our annual<br>report on Form 10-K that we filed earlier today. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind those factors and the<br>other risks factors and cautionary statements in such SEC filings. I direct you to Brookdale Senior Living's earnings release for the full safe harbor<br>statement.<br>
Also, please note that during this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. I direct you to our earnings release and our<br>supplemental information, which may be found on the Investor Relations page at brookdale.com for important information regarding the company's<br>use of non-GAAP measures, including the definitions of each of these non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of each such measure from the<br>most comparable GAAP measure.<br>
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Lee. Lee?<br>

<A name=236></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, BKD - Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Lee S. Wielansky</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - Independent Director<br>
Good morning to all our shareholders, analysts and other participants, and welcome to the Brookdale's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings<br>Call. As you are most likely aware by now, we made several significant announcements this morning, regarding a turnaround of Brookdale. I will<br>discuss the details of the strategic review and leadership changes and then turn the call over to Cindy to describe our path forward. As we announced<br>this morning, we have formally ended our strategic review, and as we promised in previous earnings calls, I will give you insights into the process.<br>We announced to kick off our strategic review in February 2017. The board and management, assisted by our legal and financial advisers, explored<br>multiple options and alternatives to create and enhance shareholder value. Throughout this process, we stated that Brookdale would enter into a<br>transaction only under terms that our board concluded will be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. It was a long and robust<br>process. We received interest from numerous potential counterparties. We reviewed a number of proposals, and we had in-depth discussions with<br>multiple foreign and domestic parties regarding various strategic alternatives, including but not limited to the sale of the company. We went<br>through multiple iterations and negotiations with several of these counterparties.<br>
As we noted before, the process was complicated by the need to incorporate certain third-party consents, and we were conducting parallel<br>negotiations to seek those consents throughout the process. An important outcome of the strategic review process was the HCP transaction that<br>we announced in the fourth quarter 2017. This improved the change of control provisions in some of our lease agreements and provides the<br>company with more transactional flexibility.<br>
At the end of the strategic review, the board ultimately rejected an indication of interest to acquire the company for $9 per share in cash, which<br>purported to range up to $11 per share in cash subject to conditions that the board did not believe were likely to be satisfied. The board did not<br>believe this offer was acceptable and believes that company can ultimately create more value for shareholders by driving higher performance as<br>a public company under new leadership. The board also believes the rejected offer and our current share price was significantly below the company's<br>intrinsic value and below our net asset value. Prior to receiving and rejecting the final indication of interest, we had other interest at higher prices<br>and we've pursued each vigorously. However, for a variety of reasons, including the necessary consents that would have enabled us to transact,<br>none resulted in firm offers. As we disclosed in today's press release, we have now concluded our strategic review. Although the formal process<br>has concluded, as always, we are committed to evaluating all opportunities to enhance shareholder value and we'll continue to do so.<br>
Now let me comment on the leadership changes we announced this morning. Andy Smith will step down as President, CEO and Board member. I<br>want to personally thank Andy for his contributions to Brookdale for over a decade. Dan Decker has also fulfilled his commitment to lead Brookdale<br>as it determined the best path forward. Now that we have set our course, Dan has completed that commitment and has chosen to retire from the<br>board effective March 1, 2018. Bill Petty has also retired from the board. I worked closely with Dan and Bill, and on behalf of the board, want to<br>express our appreciation for their leadership.<br>
Let me now announce our -- let me now address our announcement that Cindy Baier will become President, CEO and board member. Many of you<br>know Cindy as our CFO since joining Brookdale in 2015. She has built a high-performing finance function and led the following initiatives: improving<br>Brookdale's liquidity, rationalizing our corporate overhead structure, improving the quality and lowering the cost of support services provided to<br>our residents and communities and improving our visibility into the key drivers of business success. When Cindy joined Brookdale, we knew she<br>was a proven, change-oriented executive who has demonstrated her abilities across multiple industries and leadership roles. Beyond the breadth<br>of her current and prior company's CFO roles, Cindy has had multi-billion-dollar P&amp;L responsibility, has served as an executive officer, reporting to<br>the Chairman of a Fortune 30 company, was a CEO for a publicly traded retailer and has served for more than a decade as a board member of public<br>and private companies. The board has full confidence in Cindy. Over the past months, we've tasked her with additional responsibilities, including<br>to begin formulating a turnaround strategy. She has been working directly with our operational sales, marketing and other leadership teams to<br>plan and begin implementing tactics to improve our results. I look forward to working with Cindy, as the company create shareholder value by<br>improving our execution, taking additional actions to return to growth and increase margins as the industry rebounds over time.<br>
Cindy, I'll turn the call over to you now.<br>

<A name=237></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, BKD - Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
Thank you, Lee. Let me add my good wishes to Andy, Dan, Bill and Bryan Richardson, who is also leaving the company. On behalf of the leadership<br>team and our associates, I want to thank them for their years of service to Brookdale. I'm honored to take on this new role, and I'm excited by the<br>opportunity. Although Brookdale has underperformed, we have a strong foundation and tens of thousands associates who are committed to our<br>mission and to the residents we serve. I look forward, with the help of the company's associates, to restore the company to our previous success<br>by shifting our focus to winning locally, while leveraging our industry-leading scale. With the changes that I will describe today, we intend to drive<br>attractive, long-term return for our shareholders. In the past few months, by working shoulder to shoulder with the key operational leaders, we<br>have analyzed our operations to determine what is working and what is not. We developed a concrete plan to focus on the key value drivers of<br>our business model to improve the performance of the company. We will measure our progress against preestablished metrics. We will be intentional<br>about what we're going to focus on. We have a robust road map to achieve Brookdale's long-term growth potential. I'll share the details with you<br>shortly. At the same time, we know that our real estate philosophy is a critical value driver. Our goal is to optimize our portfolio, while opportunistically<br>creating value from owned real estate.<br>
Let me review our history and highlight the decisions that we've made about real estate. After integrating Emeritus communities in 2015, we<br>undertook a comprehensive review of our portfolio. In 2016, we began our portfolio optimization initiatives. Since then, we have sold or terminated<br>leases for 165 communities. These have typically been challenged assets in declining markets or community in need of significant resources. This<br>was a step towards simplifying our operations. However, the net financial impact to shareholders was not significant.<br>
During the strategic review process, we identified assets we can monetize, including several high-end communities, by taking advantage of the<br>market where stable assets are in high demand and can command high multiples. This may include some of our highest performing communities,<br>where we don't see the same future growth potential as we see in other parts of our portfolio. We also expect to continue pruning disadvantaged<br>assets from our portfolio.<br>
In 2018, we expect to market and sell approximately 30 communities, in addition to the asset dispositions we have announced previously. This is<br>likely to generate proceeds in excess of $250 million, net of associated debt and transaction costs. In the coming quarter, we will assess our capital<br>allocation strategy for these proceeds. We will continue to look for opportunities to create value from our real estate, while we pursue our turnaround<br>plan to improve our operating performance and financial results.<br>
Let me turn to the operations next. Our operating focus will be based on 3 tenets: first, attract, engage, develop and retain the best associates.<br>Second, our resident and family trust and endorsement by providing valued, high-quality care and personalized service, which in turn leaves us to<br>our third tenet, which is to drive attractive long-term returns for our shareholders. We plan to return to our strong foundation, while we will<br>differentiate ourselves based on caring associates who create passionate advocates and generate referrals. It's about winning locally while leveraging<br>our industry-leading scale and experience.<br>
On the surface, you may not see this as a big change from what we said in the past, but the reality is, our focus is very different. We will make<br>decisions closer to our customers by empowering our executive directors with more local decision rights. We are also changing how we allocate<br>our resources. This is about improving our ability to operate by narrowing our focus. You can't be the best of anything when you're trying to do<br>everything. But we will stop trying to do so much and we will eliminate anything that distracts us from our mission. We will make sure that our<br>associates are able to focus only on what matters most, our residents.<br>
I'm excited to share a few comments about the 3 pillars of our path forward: associates, residents and shareholders. First, we will invest appropriately<br>in our associates. We are on the right track with our initiatives around key leadership. In 2017, we took the first step to invest more in the top roles<br>in our communities. We made good progress with our efforts to improve the retention of our executive directors and our health and wellness<br>directors. Because of this success, we are expanding this program deeper in our community organization. And it's more than just increasing<br>compensation. For example, we are improving how we recruit and onboard our new associates into their role. This is already begun to favorably<br>impact turnover by reducing churns in the first year. We will ensure that our associates' interests are closely aligned with the work they do. That<br>they know that the work they do is meaningful and that they receive the proper rewards for their efforts. At the same time, we will invest in<br>technology to remove routine tasks so the associate can center their attention on the work they enjoy most, taking care of our residents. By building<br>a workforce that is valued and supported, we can better attract, retain and develop an excellent team.<br>

<A name=238></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, BKD - Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call<br>
Second, our strategy improved our focus on our residents and patients. Our unwavering commitment is to our customers. We will continue our<br>work on enhancing our customer value proposition, differentiating based on quality, choice, personalized services and associates who care. We<br>will raise Brookdale's profile on a local level with potential customers and their adult children. We will concentrate on customer satisfaction because<br>we know through improving Net Promoter Score, work that delighted our residents, correlates with higher performance. We've identified the need<br>to change our sales and marketing national versus local mix and intend to implement other changes we've identified to improve our performance.<br>For example, we have initiatives to improve our lead management, pursuing the most productive channels, improving our initial response and<br>follow up on those leads and marketing in a local targeted manner. At the same time, we are discontinuing well-meaning initiatives that distract<br>from the things that matter most.<br>
Third, and finally, from the operational standpoint, we will continue to optimize our business model to strengthen our financial proposition. We<br>will execute on our new real estate initiatives that I outlined earlier. Over the past several years, we have taken incremental steps with divestitures<br>and G&amp;A cuts. We are committed taking additional actions to return this company to the great leadership position that it had in the past.<br>
This week, we are implementing additional G&amp;A cuts. This includes eliminating projects outside of our key focus areas, consolidating our operating<br>divisions and flattening the organization in order to get better economies of scale in our back office. In total, we are targeting $25 million of G&amp;A<br>savings, before normal cost inflation and normalized bonuses. These cuts are meaningful to cash flow. We are continuing to assess our operating<br>expenses to ensure that the costs are supporting our most important initiatives. We are cutting costs in order to invest in the areas that we believe<br>will have a lasting, positive impact on our competitive positioning.<br>
I would like to close my remarks with a few comments about what we experienced in 2017 and what we expect to see in 2018. 2017 was a difficult<br>year. We experienced competitive new openings across many of our markets, and our teams were proactive with actions regarding marketing,<br>pricing and capital expenditures to meet those pressures. Our occupancies seasonally declined in the first half, exacerbated by a flu season that<br>extended into the second quarter. During the second half of the year, we improved occupancy and achieved a positive rate growth, though subdued<br>as we fought for market share. Our labor cost increased during the year, due to both the competition for new associates and our intentional<br>investments to improve retention. Our portfolio optimization reduced revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the short run, while shedding owned and<br>leased assets that we did not feel strengthened our platform in the long term. We responded well to significant natural disasters in Florida, Texas<br>and California to protect our residents and patients, but these events did have a financial impact on us. The growth of our key metrics was also<br>impacted by the positive reserve adjustments made in 2016 that did not recur in 2017. During 2017, we made good progress with our balance<br>sheet. We built a significant amount of liquidity and refinanced on major 2018 mortgage debt maturities. Taking the cash on hand to pay off the<br>convert in 2018 into account, we have a very reasonable debt maturities over the next 5 years. As of year-end 2017, we have $873 million liquidity,<br>including $515 million of cash and marketable securities and $358 million of availability on our line of credit.<br>
Looking quickly at our quarterly results, we were pleased with our fourth quarter 2017 business performance. There was really no change in the<br>macro environment from the prior quarter, with elevated competition and material labor cost pressures.<br>
Our occupancy performance for the fourth quarter was good -- for fourth quarter, producing a 40 basis point sequential increase. This was in spite<br>of a difficult December, which experienced an adverse weather impact and a flu season that was more severe than normal and, which started earlier<br>than usual.<br>
Our aggregate rate growth remains steady even as we built occupancy. We remain proactive with our pricing actions and saw a negative<br>mark-to-market on new move-ins, which went from minus 6% to minus 3% in the fourth quarter. On the expense side, our labor costs continue to<br>increase, due to tightness in the labor market, wage inflations and company initiated investments, as I mentioned before.<br>
In the fourth quarter, we continue to see specific, positive impact of our initiatives to improve our operating performance. For example, we saw<br>voluntary turnover of our top 3 community leader positions declined 19% year-over-year in our consolidated portfolio for both the quarter and<br>the full year.<br>
Let's turn to 2018. As we look at 2018, our senior housing business is in the midst of a perfect storm of heavy pressure from new supply, wage<br>pressure from a tight labor market, the constant pressure of lease escalators and the relatively recent pressure of rising interest rates. We expect<br>

competitive new openings to remain elevated through 2018 and absorption of new deliveries to create occupancy pressure throughout the year.<br>Additionally, we have seen a difficult start to the year, with impacts from harsh weather and a flu outbreak that began in December. We do expect,<br>based on the strategy described earlier and the investments we're making, that we will begin to demonstrate improvement as we prepare to return<br>to year-over-year growth in 2019. With my appointment as CEO this week, I will take the time to continue to study the business in a thoughtful<br>manner, to meet with our REIT and other key partners and to further refine our near-term plan before issuing formal guidance for 2018. However,<br>I will provide some color about 2018. Year-over-year comparisons will continue to be negatively impacted by the impact of our announced<br>dispositions either due to the full year effect of 2017 closed transactions or those that we close in 2018. However, these real estate initiatives will<br>position us for creating long-term shareholder value. Slide 21 in our current investor presentation, which is on our website, is helpful to understand<br>the impacts of our portfolio optimization initiative. This slide is a pro forma of our 2017 result, after reflecting the impact of transactions that are<br>complete or in process, but does not include the approximately 30 additional asset sales that we announced today. While some of these transactions<br>will only be reflected for part of 2018, this slide will help you understand the results of our continuing operation. There is no doubt that 2018 will<br>be challenging, but with the operational changes and investments we're making coupled with a focus on execution, I am confident we will begin<br>the process of improving our results and performance and position Brookdale for future growth and success. Our strategy is built on growing the<br>top line, in spite of the challenges we face in our market. We expect same-store occupancy to be slightly down for the full year. It's important to<br>note that our portfolio differs from the REIT because we are starting from a lower occupancy base and we have more communities in secondary<br>markets, where we project fewer openings in 2018 than primary markets. It's also important to note that because our occupancy declined during<br>2017, we have to recapture the occupancy loss during 2017, before we can grow in 2018. We do expect our occupancy to be impacted by the flu<br>season. Based on what we know today, this is the worst flu season in 20 years as it relates to seniors. Our first obligation is to protect the seniors<br>we serve and so as a result, we have closed our communities to new admissions for over 1,000 days in the first 45 days of the quarter. This compares<br>to closing our communities for 800 days during the entire first quarter of last year. When our communities are closed, we can't conduct tours or<br>move new residents in, which has an adverse impact on occupancy. At the same time, we are seeing an elevated death rate. We expect same-store<br>total labor costs, including benefit, to continue to grow beyond customary inflationary increases. In 2018, we expect a 5.5% to 6% increase on a<br>year-over-year basis as we invest deeper into the organization to improve retention that creates growth. Finally, we expect to somewhat reduce<br>per-unit spend on capital expenditures, but remain committed to spend appropriately to support the business.<br>
So as I wrap up these prepared remarks, let me be clear. 2018 will be a very tough year. The changes I outlined will be painful, but necessary. And<br>we will adapt as we learn. We need to fix and invest in operations to get back on the right long-term path. While those investments will impact<br>year-over-year comparisons, it will ultimately lead to higher occupancy, stronger rate growth and greater, more sustainable adjusted EBITDA and<br>cash flow.<br>
Finally, I want to close by saying that I believe strongly in the growth opportunities for Brookdale. In late 2017, we started to demonstrate progress<br>in key areas. Continuing the momentum will allow us to overcome the near-term headwinds and lay the foundation for success. In the future, the<br>demographics will become a tremendous tailwind for the industry. Health care spending continues to increase as the population ages and senior<br>housing will play an important part in caring for this country's seniors. Our readers are working diligently to execute our new strategies to drive<br>improved operating performance and create shareholder value.<br>
I'm happy to answer your questions now.<br>

<b>Jason Michael Plagman</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Associate<br>
This is Jason Plagman on for Brian. So Cindy, just -- I know you touched on this in your prepared comments, but can you just comment on kind of<br>your key areas of focus for the first -- your first 90 days in the CEO role then even 365 days kind of what are your top 2 or 3 priorities that you'll be<br>spending the most time on?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
Thanks for the question. Our top priority is to turnaround our company performance. We're focused on winning locally. This was very successful<br>for us in the past, and we're confident that our new plans will work. We've already identified and started initiating changes. We're holding ourselves<br>accountable just like we know you will, not only to make the changes, but also to measure and report on key operational metrics. We plan to<br>execute on a wide range of initiatives to create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.<br>
<b>Jason Michael Plagman</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Associate<br>
And then, I think you mentioned ongoing discussions with your real estate partners. How are you thinking through that? And that was big area of<br>focus during strategic review process. Are you still working towards reducing the barriers related to those consent processes?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
We are looking for win-win relationships with our REIT partners. We value those relationships.<br>
<b>Jason Michael Plagman</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Associate<br>
Okay. That makes sense. And then just on the numbers, I don't know if I missed it, but did you mention on your outlook for month -- annual rent<br>increases, both in-place and the improved mark-to-market place? How are you thinking about where rent increases will shake out for 2018?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
So we didn't provide specific guidance for our rent increases, but we do expect to see normal in-place rent increases. And we expect to see continued<br>pressure on mark-to-market on our same-store communities.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question is from Joanna Gajuk from Bank of America.<br>
<b>Joanna Sylvia Gajuk</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
Cindy, congratulations. So actually, on the last question partially, because on the Slide 18, I guess, you talk about the expect -- margin expansion<br>in 2019. So should I read into this, so you're trying to say that, I guess, and your comments kind of suggested because you said '18 will be a challenging<br>year, so we should think about sort of not seeing margin expansion in 2018?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
That's correct. It will be a difficult year, but we expect to return to year-over-year growth in 2019.<br>

<b>Joanna Sylvia Gajuk</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
And did I hear it right, so you talk about the labor cost outlook for '18, 5.5% to 6%? So was it for the full year '17?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
We are close to 6% in the fourth quarter and over 5% for the full year. So if you think about 2018, we're expecting to see similar labor growth and<br>that is total compensation, including benefit on our same communities.<br>
<b>Joanna Sylvia Gajuk</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
All right. And then, you also said that in also the -- one of the slides, talk about reducing or rather realigning how you spend your CapEx, right? So<br>you have this metric here when you kind of talk about, it seems the recurring CapEx or the community level CapEx. So can you maybe flush out<br>your view in terms of the different buckets for your total CapEx? Also Program Max and EBITDA, enhancing CapEx and any piece of corporate versus<br>recurring, how can you -- so how should we think about it for next year or maybe the next couple of years in terms of changes versus Q4, for<br>example?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
So Joanna, we're not giving formal guidance in this call, but what I can say with regard to our community level CapEx, on a same-store basis, it's<br>not going to be terribly different than 2017. We are expecting to increase our Program Max investments. And as you know, we think Program Max<br>is something that drives a lot of value for our shareholders. We normally see double-digit returns on those projects and so we want to invest more<br>there. I will also say that in 2018, we will have hurricane-related Capex as we finished cleaning up the damage in Florida, primarily from the hurricanes<br>that hit their last year and some extra onetime CapEx potentially to respond to the new legislation that's in process for Florida generators.<br>
<b>Joanna Sylvia Gajuk</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
Right. So I guess, on that front, so you said it -- you plan to increase the Program Max because that's where you see the highest returns. So what<br>are the some of the examples of projects that you mentioned that you will try to, I guess, walk away from, so to speak, or refocus this spending. So<br>is it the cap exposure? Or is it something also that's could on the operating expenses? So any kind of examples you can give us in terms of things<br>you -- as of now, you decided to kind of reduce exposure because what I'm getting at is, is there something where you kind of considering maybe<br>reducing your Ancillary Services business at all?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
So let me take that question. I think there are a few questions in there. So first with regard to CapEx, we are not reducing the number of CapEx<br>projects we have by any mean. In fact, with Program Max, we're increasing the number of projects that we have underway, but as you think about<br>the impact of projects on the community, our objective is to reduce well-meaning initiatives that are impacting our communities. So if you think<br>about it, there has been numerous, numerous department-driven pilot projects that consume the time of our community leaders. We have and<br>will continue to eliminate many of these. Regarding streamlining, one example that we significantly abbreviated was a 600-item questionnaire<br>that previously each community had to complete. We're also improving our decision rights. And so one of the focus areas that we have is we want<br>our decisions to be as close to the customer as they can be. So we're empowering our executive directors and that's something that's a pretty big<br>focus for us. With regard to our Ancillary Services business, we think that's a critical part of our business and we think that it provides a differentiation<br>for our customers as they're able to get additional care within the same company.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from Chad Vanacore from Stifel.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
So Cindy, you mentioned occupancy, you're in a difficult December, but also we look at occupancy, it had been up 40 basis points sequentially in<br>the fourth quarter. So how did that occupancy trend by month?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
So we were up in October and November and then we were down in December. Now in December, there are 2 things that were challenges for us:<br>the first was it was an unseasonably harsh weather pattern and the second was that the flu season started much earlier this year than it normally<br>does. Normally, we don't see a flu impact until the first quarter, but we did see the flu hit our communities in Q4, particularly in Northeast. Now as<br>I've mentioned, when there is flu in a community, we basically close the community. And we do that to protect our residents. We also do that to<br>make sure that we're protecting everyone. So when that happened, we can't give tours, we can't move new residents in and so because of that<br>you have an impact on occupancy.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Right. And it seems like that occupancy is bleeding into the fourth quarter, and you had mentioned that the flu had really closed to -- down for<br>about 1,000 days in that first 45 days in a month. So how has -- how's that occupancy trended in January? Can you put a number to it?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
I won't put a number to it, but what I will say is that in Q1, we normally experienced a seasonal decline. So Q1 is always, almost always lower than<br>sort of Q4 and 2018 is no different than that. As you did mention, we are having a flu impact. It's the worst flu season for seniors as it's been in 20<br>years. And so that has an effect not only on our move-ins, but also in having an increased death rate.<br>

So to the best of your estimate, what would you say the actual flu impact is over, what would be normal seasonality?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
It's too soon to say. As far as we know, the flu impact hasn't peaked yet. It normally peaks about this time, but we're still seeing pretty elevated<br>path. When we get together on our next call, we'll be able to provide additional clarity on that for you.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
All right. Well, I guess, I will change gears a little bit. And then just thinking about the strategic review process, what were some of the terms in that<br>indicated offer that you mentioned that the board felt was unachievable or untenable?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
Lee, do you want to take that one?<br>

<b>Lee S. Wielansky</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - Independent Director<br>
As we said in our previous comments, the offer was $9 a share and...<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
All right. So really price basically?<br>
<b>Lee S. Wielansky</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - Independent Director<br>
Say it again.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
If it's -- if that was really the -- if price consideration was the -- was a stumbling block?<br>
<b>Lee S. Wielansky</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - Independent Director<br>
Yes.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
All right. And then, just one... Go ahead.<br>
<b>Lee S. Wielansky</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - Independent Director<br>
Just -- I mean, to comment -- I mean, we look at the net asset value of the company, and we felt like that for shareholders that it's -- it's worth a<br>whole lot more than $9 per share.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
All right. Then just switching gears one more time. The G&amp;A cut that you expect to happen in 2018. You are looking at a run rate at $25 million<br>once fully enacted, when do you expect to get to that full run rate?<br>
<b>Lucinda M. Baier</b> - Brookdale Senior Living Inc. - CFO<br>
So the $25 million is the impact for 2018. An annualized impact of that is over $30 million. And I will say that we've already taken a large number<br>of the actions this week, in fact. Just to remind our G&amp;A. Now a quick reminder, the $25 million is before normal cost inflation and before normalized<br>bonuses. Because we underperformed last year, we paid much lower than normal bonuses and our expectation is that we will perform in 2018 and<br>so we will pay normalized bonuses.<br>
<b>Chad Christopher Vanacore</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Analyst<br>
All right. But to get $25 million, how should that trend through the year?<br>

We're going to get started. So I'm sure many of you will remember the wonderful dinner that IFF hosted for us at CAGNY last year. We were treated<br>to an interactive education on the science and artistry of the flavor and fragrance world. Since then, the company has accelerated its growth against<br>the backdrop of decelerating industry volume trends, thanks in part to a keen focus on health and wellness and the resurgence in demand from<br>local and regional customers. We're delighted to have both the company's CEO, Andreas Fibig; and CFO, Rich O'Leary, here with us today. Thank<br>you both for joining us at CAGNY again this year.<br>
<b>Andreas Fibig</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - Chairman and CEO<br>
Thank you, Lauren, for the intro and good afternoon to everybody. I would like to encourage you to read first the cautionary statement before we<br>proceed for the presentation.<br>
What we want to do today and what we have on the agenda is, we want to show you what kind of progress we have made in terms of executing<br>towards our Vision 2020. We want to show you as well what are the adaptations we have done last year to make sure that we are really current in<br>the things we're doing, particularly on the pipeline and on the customer side. I want to show you what our go-forward priorities are. And we will<br>give you a sneak peek what we have in our pipeline, what kind of products we have to help our customers, and you have seen many of them over<br>the last 2 days, to be successful in the marketplace. And then certainly, we want to show you the financial performance.<br>
Let me start with a slide we have built in 2015. That's when we started to roll out our Vision 2020, our strategy for the next 5 years. We are now well<br>within the planning cycle. The first pillar was and it's still the innovation piece. How can we make sure that we come up with the right amount of<br>technology and molecules and products to help our customers to be successful in the marketplace? I want to remind you we spent between 8%<br>and 9% of our sales in R&amp;D to come up with these solutions. And we're really looking for differentiation here. We have defined where are the areas<br>and the regions of the world where we want to win. In particular, North America was on the list, but also Africa and Middle East. We have defined<br>what are the core lists, which are relevant for us going forward. And what are the customers we really aim for, whether they are big or midmarket<br>customers. And then how can we strengthen our portfolio in a sense of geographic presence, but in a sense of technology as well? And that's what<br>I would like to show you in the next slide.<br>
That's what happened until end of last year already. Our pipeline in terms of innovation and molecules is probably as filled and as rich as it was<br>never before in the history of IFF. We came up with 11 new captive fragrance ingredients, all patent protected, 9 new naturals, and with the first<br>cradle-to-cradle fragrance as well to underline the sustainability efforts we're doing as a company as well.<br>
Technologies like modulation and encapsulation are growing double-digit and they are by far not at the end of their life cycle. We are still innovating<br>in these areas to come up with better solutions for the customers and the consumers. We have made considerable progress in terms of our home<br>market, North America. We are meanwhile the #1 flavors house for the mid-tier market. And mid-tier is so important because that's where the<br>growth is at the moment, particularly in the food area. We have made also good progress in Africa and Middle East.<br>

<hr>
<A name=247></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 8:00PM, IFF - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group of<br>New York Conference<br>
We went on a couple of new colloids with some of our big, big players. And we made progress in a sense of expanding our portfolio as well into<br>an adjacent area, which is the active cosmetic ingredients. And you see it, we have made 5 acquisitions since 2015. Some of them are in adjacent<br>areas like Lucas Meyers and PowderPure. Some like Fragrance Resources, Ottens and David Michael are more in the traditional area to strengthen<br>outreach to certain customers, but I will come to that.<br>
So you see good progress here on the execution of our 2020 strategy.<br>
Coming to the financials. We have posted the 6% 3-year component average growth rate on the sales side, which is certainly outperforming the<br>market because you have seen that, particularly in the last 2 to 3 years, there was not much volume growth with many of our customers. And also<br>an 8% 3 years' CAGR on the EPS front as well.<br>
And that turns to the total shareholder return over the last 3 years, which certainly has outperformed our benchmark, the S&amp;P 500, but our main<br>competitors in Europe as well. So you see so far we are making good progress in a time which was very, very volatile for us because not as much<br>growth as we saw when we started to come up with our vision. And currency with the U.S. dollar stronger than we had planned for as well. And<br>we're actually very happy right now that this tide is turning and we have a little bit of a tailwind here.<br>
Let me talk about the go-forward strategies. What do we want to achieve in the next 2 to 3 years until 2020?<br>
We've looked at how can we adapt our strategy from 2015. So what stays and what has to be adapted. First of all, driving differentiation is still a<br>very super-important headline for us because innovations drive our business, innovation drives the business of our customers. And that's the reason<br>why we want to stay focused and even being more differentiated than we have been in the past, and the examples will come. We really want to<br>balance our customers. You might remember from our last presentation -- or presentations, we have 50-50 small customers, local customers, 50%<br>global big customers. And that's our base. What we try to do right now is to look how can we supplement our customer base with more of the<br>midsize customers to make sure that we capture the growth, which is in these companies, whether it's in the U.S., in Western Europe, but in the<br>emerging market as well. And I will talk to that in a minute.<br>
Maximizing the portfolio. So really looking what are the categories we really want to go forward? Where is the profitability which we can move<br>forward? And interesting enough -- and I was very happy that Kiehl's has their little outlet over there, which is a customer as well -- these are areas<br>which are incredibly profitable also for us to deliver our active cosmetic ingredients for them to come up with good solutions, and then generate<br>return to make sure that we keep our cost base as much under control as we can.<br>
Let me start with the R&amp;D piece. And I'm really excited about it. What we have done is, we have looked how we can focus our R&amp;D in the areas<br>which really matter. What you see here is certainly naturals because you have heard it probably from many of the food companies, clean label,<br>naturals -- also in the cosmetic sector is super important. So focus on this part, active cosmetics, I talked to that. And health and nutrition and,<br>particularly the health area super important for us as well. And then delivery system modulation and ingredients, that's kind of a standard for us<br>because we believe that, particularly in natural modulation like sweetness modulation or enhancers or delivery systems, capsule systems for<br>fragrances, we're really on forefront compared to our competitors.<br>
So let me give you a couple of examples. The first one is the fragrance ingredients. The fragrance ingredients are usually the molecules we come<br>up with and it takes 2 to 5 years to invent some of them, to come up with a patented molecule, which our perfumers can use to come up with new<br>fragrance solutions. And if you take Fine Fragrance, then have usually 80 different molecules in one of these fragrances. And you need new molecules<br>so that the palette of your perfumers gets bigger and bigger so that they can pick and choose and come up with really great, great, great solutions.<br>
Here you see fantastic pipeline, rollout of the first molecules and you see at the last line, we have the strongest pipeline in our history and we expect<br>to launch 8 to 12 molecules until 2021. And again, it's a 2- to 5-year cycle to come up with these new molecules as there went a lot of work into<br>that to get them to the state where they are right now.<br>
The next one, clean label. Super important topic for all of the food companies. What can we do to help the food companies, small or big, to come<br>up with clean label solutions. We acquired a company last year in Oregon called PowderPure. What they take, they take food swipe screens -- and<br>

remember 40% of all the food in the U.S. is wasted. So they take, let's say, food swipes from tomatoes, pepper. And then they have a drying<br>technology called Infidri, which is a patented technology which takes very softly, very gently the water out of the system, out of the product and<br>makes powder out of it. It is 100% natural, 100% organic and you can use it for taste solutions and for color solutions at the same time. And this is<br>a super important platform for us for clean label. But mainly for some of our cosmetics as well, and we're talking right now what can we do in terms<br>of lipsticks, even flavors for dental solution or for oral care solutions. So it's important technology, and you will see over the next years more to<br>come out of this technology.<br>
The next is graying hair. It's certainly an important topic for most of us, despite Mike. He was certainly not in the clinical trial. But we have round<br>about 8 years -- or took us almost 8 years to come up with a solution here with a molecule, which is a biomimetic peptide which can reverse the<br>graying of the hair. This molecule is not on the market. Next quarter we will roll it out to all the beauty companies like the L'Oreals of world to look<br>what we can do to put this into action with some of their solutions. So you see very much still in an adjacent area where we were not before. But<br>now we are moving into the cosmetic area much stronger because we believe there is good profitability to be get out of this segment.<br>
The next thing, again, active cosmetics. Many of the millennials, certainly not me, but the millennials, they do selfies like there's no tomorrow. And<br>what is the statistic? 75,000 selfies in their lifetime. And what is an issue is that it particularly adds to pollution. In many of the cities of the world,<br>you get a little bit of an oily skin. And we have developed out of an Australian lemon myrtle 4 biological targets we can use to effectively reverse<br>that oiliness on the skin. And we will find a solution in some of our customer products as well. And we believe it's spot on, because it's natural, it<br>comes from one of our natural facilities in Australia. We're the only one who have access to them. And it is towards the target group of the millennials,<br>which is certainly a growing group as well to make a good business proposal here.<br>
So you see even in the active cosmetics area, good progress in terms of our pipeline. And you will hear more over next couple of months whether<br>we are buying into a technology solution or coming up with our own solutions. Stay tuned, more to come, particularly in the next 6 months.<br>
Balanced customer. I talked briefly about it. 50-50, at the moment 50% of our sales was global customers, 50% was local and regional customers.<br>So what are these local customers doing or what do they need different from the big companies? What we see is that many of them like to work<br>with smaller companies, smaller outlets, because they play a bigger part with them. They like to have customized service levels. They like more<br>speed in the development of products. And it's very, very clear. If somebody comes like a Chobani and they want to have a new blueberry flavor,<br>just picking an example, they want to have the solution maybe in 2 or 3 weeks to launch this product quite quickly, which is very different from<br>other bigger companies where it takes more time.<br>
So we said what can we do at IFF to build an outlet, which exactly can serve the midmarket? And we created a platform. It's called Tastepoint here<br>in the U.S. And I can tell you what we have seen so far is double-digit growth out of Tastepoint. So we took 2 of our acquisitions, Ottens and David<br>Michael, both in Philly. We united them under the label of Tastepoint and rolled it out since last year and it is growing quite dramatically compared<br>to the core business. And I'll show you a quick video of what we did here.<br>
(presentation)<br>
<b>Andreas Fibig</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - Chairman and CEO<br>
And so far, we see good success, double-digit growth in the U.S. market towards these customers. Now the challenge for the team is how can we<br>roll it out on a global base? What can we do to do it in Europe and some of our other bigger markets as well? But we are not stopping in the U.S.<br>We inaugurated a new creative center in Cairo, particularly for the North African customers. We're investing in Sri City, which is north of Chennai,<br>into a new flavors and fragrance facility for our local customers in India, which is a super important market to us, double-digit growth as well. And<br>we're building a new factory in China as well.<br>
You see there is more to come, in particular, towards the small and midsized customers.<br>
So how do we maximize the portfolio to harvest the profitability we need going forward? These are the 4 categories, particularly the first 3 where<br>we put some emphasis on it because they're incredibly profitable for us and for our customers as well. I always touched on the active cosmetic<br>

ingredients, particularly in hair care and skin solutions, Fine Fragrances, Beverages, and then the value-added seasoning. And I think the most<br>important thing is the value added here because that what makes the difference compared to regular seasoning solutions.<br>
On generating return. We generated $125 million in total savings over the last 4 years -- over the last 3 years and that's '18, the estimate. We used<br>it to help to both for the bottom line but as well to look where can we invest it, particularly in the R&amp;D field to make sure that we have enough dry<br>powder in our pipeline. We did a couple of exercises with 0-based projecting, acquisition of integration synergies, procurement, the usual things.<br>It's a lot of homework, but it's yielding results in the last 3 years and certainly going forward here as well.<br>
So and that's already the summary of the first part of the presentation you see. We had our strategy in 2015. We executed on the strategy. We<br>adapted last year because of the volatility of the market. And you see the 4 new elements in there like drive differentiation, balance customers,<br>maximize portfolio and generate return, they are all in the confines of our -- hovers on the confines of our 4 pillars.<br>
And I hope that gives you an idea what we have done in the execution of these and what kind of results that has yielded so far.<br>
But I know that Rich will talk about more results to come going forward. Rich?<br>
<b>Richard A. O'Leary</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - CFO and EVP<br>
Thanks, Andreas, and good afternoon to everybody. It's a pleasure to be here again. Somehow I missed the demo day for Greyverse in New York.<br>So I'm going to have to get that the next time it comes around. It's my objective today, walk you through a quick recap on our 2017 results that we<br>announced last week, but the bulk of my discussion will be forward looking around 2018 and how we think about our financial perspectives and<br>the capital allocation on a long-term basis.<br>
Under the recap, our 2017 results, again, on the right side, you see full year results on currency neutral basis, top line growth at 9%, including<br>acquisitions. Currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 5% during the year. And currency neutral EPS grew 9%. We did have the benefit in<br>the fourth quarter related to a substantially lower tax rate related to some valuation allowances that we eliminated in the fourth quarter. As I step<br>back and think about 2017, it was a solid year. I mean, we continue to make progress against our performance after 2 difficult years in 2015, 2016.<br>I think we certainly exited 2017 with more momentum than what we saw entering 2017, the first half of the year. And I think that sets a good<br>foundation for our plan in 2018 and going forward.<br>
From a cash standpoint and cash generation, I'll talk about cash flows in a couple of slides, but overall when you think about our capital allocation<br>and what we used cash for in 2017, from a CapEx standpoint, which is our first priority, what are we going to do to grow the organic business. We<br>spent about 4% of sales on CapEx in 2017. Andreas highlighted some of the key projects as we continue to make investments, particularly in Greater<br>Asia and our creative centers around the world.<br>
From an M&amp;A standpoint, as we talked about, we've spent a little over $200 million on the acquisitions of Fragrance Resources and PowderPure.<br>Andreas certainly walked you through the strategic logic behind both of those acquisitions. And those 2 businesses on a run-rate basis are expected<br>to add about $90 million in revenue to our top line.<br>
And the third key pillar of our capital allocation strategy, returning cash to our shareholders. A little over $260 million in cash returned to the<br>shareholders in 2017 right within our long-term targets of 50% to 60% at 56% of sales. And we continue to make that a priority. And our cash flows<br>enable us to do that and balance the internal aspects of the business as well as our shareholders, stakeholders and their interest in our business.<br>
So enough of the past looking backwards, let me just focus now going forward. This is a recap of our financial expectations and our projections for<br>2018. On an adjusted currency neutral basis, we expect to have a top line growth of 3% to 5% in 2018, improve leverage in the business between<br>top line and operating profit with operating profit on a currency neutral basis adjusted growing 5% to 7%. And a little bit of pressure between<br>operating profit and EPS, with EPS growing on a currency neutral basis 4% to 6%. The bit of the drag between operating profit and EPS, the effective<br>tax rate is expected to go up a little bit in 2018. We've got higher interest expense and lower pension income that are driving the deleverage<br>between operating profit and EPS. But still good strong improved performance and sequential improvement from what we've seen from '15 to '16<br>

and '17 to '18. Currency expected to be a tailwind based on current exchange rates, a tailwind in 2018 versus a headwind in 2017, adding about 3<br>percentage points to top line and about 1.5% to both operating profit and EPS. So on a reported basis adjusted, expect to see 6% to 8% top line<br>growth in 2018, 6.5% to 8.5% on the operating profit line and 5.5% to 7.5% at the EPS line.<br>
Two of our key priorities for -- from a financial perspective and operating perspective, 2 of our key focus areas for 2017, first -- or 2018, first, clearly<br>continue to deliver on the operating profit acceleration. You can see on a reported basis, the improvement that we've made over the last 3 years<br>expect to make -- again, clearly 2015, 2016 were challenging years -- we made some improvement in 2017, and we really want to accelerate that<br>growth in 2018. And so including -- as I said on previous slide, including the favorable tailwinds we expect to get from a currency standpoint, I<br>expect adjusted operating profit to grow between 6.5% and 8.5% this year.<br>
That profitability in improvement and profitability in acceleration is really driven by top line growth that Andreas talked about earlier, driven both<br>by innovation as well as a balance in our customers, and as I said earlier I think from a macroeconomic standpoint, sort of big picture standpoint,<br>we feel the foundation is stronger as we head into '18 than where we certainly were as we headed into 2017.<br>
We will continue to focus on and manage the things that we can control our best, which is our productivity program, ZBB, and our spending as we<br>monitor performance on the top line in a margin standpoint and we balance our internal priorities with our external commitments.<br>
2017, looking back, there is no other way to say this, but it was a disappointing year from a cash flow standpoint. Some of it was event driven,<br>whether it is a litigation settlement and some of the cash outlays related to restructuring programs and profit improvement programs. But the<br>simplest measure of looking at our cash flow from operations as a percentage of adjusted net income, we were about 85% in 2017. Now for some<br>businesses, that might be pretty good from a quality of earnings standpoint. Historically this business in our company, and that's not where we<br>want to be. So we're going to focus on improved cash flow generation and, particularly working capital in 2018. You see here it's going to encompass<br>all 3 key elements of working capital whether it's accounts payable, accounts receivable and inventory. So I do expect to see cash flow from<br>operations in 2018 much more in line with historical norms and at or above 100% conversion versus where we were in 2017.<br>
Taking a step back and thinking more sort of big picture. Our priorities in terms of what we do with our cash flow haven't changed. Our first focus<br>area again is to grow our organic business and that's investing the necessary funds from a CapEx standpoint. Second, we want to continue to<br>expand on and execute against our M&amp;A strategy. And, third return cash to our shareholders consistent with our 50% to 60% target. And that<br>framework hasn't changed, and I don't expect it to change going forward.<br>
So deep in -- a little bit of a deep dive into those 3 elements. Again, here is a recap of CapEx. 2017, we came in 3.8%. That is below where we expected<br>to be, I expected it to be closer to 4.5% in 2017. Couple of big projects were delayed whether it was from a regulatory or approval process standpoint<br>or from an operational standpoint where we had to wait until the operations side of the business was ready to support the change in the CapEx<br>and transfer the business.<br>
So '17 was below where we wanted to be. That's certainly going to put pressure on '18 and '19. You see here we expect to be somewhere between<br>4% and 5% of sales into both 2018 and 2019. I would expect this to be at the higher end of those ranges certainly for 2018 given some of the big<br>projects that Andreas alluded to earlier. And our ability to execute and move forward operationally on the CapEx in '18 and '19 will largely drive<br>our ability to get back to a more normal level of CapEx of 3.5% of sales in 2020. And that's really our long-term expectation on needed CapEx to<br>support the business going forward.<br>
From an M&amp;A standpoint with the 4, 5 deals we've done over the last 2 years -- 2.5 years since we announced Vision 2020, we are on target versus<br>our long -- our Vision '20 target of adding between $0.5 billion and $1 billion in sales through our M&amp;A program. We're about 60% of the way<br>through the end of 2017. We're continuing to look at targets at various stages through our pipeline. The lenses that we look in terms of evaluating<br>targets and evaluating M&amp;A haven't changed in terms of the strategic drivers, where we see the value creation. And certainly from my perspective,<br>the criteria we use to evaluate whether a deal is executable or not in terms of the financial returns, we have not changed that a bit from when we<br>started the journey 2.5 years ago.<br>

<A name=251></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 8:00PM, IFF - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group of<br>New York Conference<br>
From a cash returned to shareholders standpoint, you see here our components of cash returned to shareholders since 2013 to 2017, over that<br>5-year period, we've returned in excess of $1 billion to shareholders. The components and mix has changed over time. 2015, 2016, we were well<br>above this 50% to 60% target. 2017, as I alluded to earlier, was about 56% split between, primarily dividend and share buybacks had come down<br>significantly from prior year periods. For 2018, I would expect this to be in a similar range and somewhere between 50% and 60% with the primary<br>driver being dividends as opposed to share repurchases.<br>
With that, let me turn it back over to Andreas.<br>
<b>Andreas Fibig</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - Chairman and CEO<br>
Thank you, Rich. Let me summarize what we have presented here so far. So what really makes us optimistic going forward towards '18 and then<br>the last 2 years of our strategic planning cycle is we believe we have the right strategy in place. We're executing the strategy. We've demonstrated<br>robust progress in most of the elements and the pillars of the strategy. We've very focused priorities whether is it in the R&amp;D piece or in the pipeline<br>to come up with right solution for our customers, or whether it is the outreach to the new customer groups or more dynamic customer groups to<br>make sure that we really capture that growth as well. And as you have seen from Rich's presentation, we have made progress on the financial side<br>as well.<br>
So that's what we wanted to present to you, our vision, our execution and how we see 2018 and probably, a little bit of a peek of '19 as well because<br>some of it will basically reach into '19 as well. So thank you very much, and we are open for questions. Mike?<br>

<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Let's start with John (inaudible).<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Andreas, I just wanted to ask about the fine -- the proprietary molecules, the 8 to 12 molecules by 2021. What would be a typical rate of contribution?<br>How do the economics work for that? And how much financial contribution does that kind of progress make? What impact does that have on you?<br>
<b>Andreas Fibig</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - Chairman and CEO<br>
That's a good question, but a hard question to answer as well because the quantity of the molecules is just one element. The second one is the<br>quality and how fast and quickly a molecule is already used by the perfumers. So I can't answer that question. But it will help us to propel the $300<br>million to $400 million Fine Fragrance business in a good growth rate going forward and all encumbered without going to every single molecule<br>because it really depends how frequently it's used by the perfumers. But I can tell you we had in the past roundabout 1 to 2 new molecules and<br>now we're having a much higher rate. And we've adapted our ingredient strategy as well because we are selling some of our ingredients to other<br>companies as well, even our competitors. And in the past, we've kept the captured molecules for a longer period just to ourselves. Now we have<br>just 6 to 12 months where we have them and then we sell them to the outside world as well, which helps us with our Ingredients sales and puts<br>more pressure on the internal organization as well to use them as long as they are really proprietary to them.<br>

<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Can you talk a little bit about your long-term margin outlook? Because some of your competitors have historically said that they think there is a<br>cap on margins. And as you think about especially today's environment where it's more difficult to get pricing from customers, sort of just where<br>-- what are some of the drivers of your long-term operating margin?<br>
<b>Andreas Fibig</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - Chairman and CEO<br>
We believe on the sales side, as you can see, and the operating profit if you take the BASF situation, we had in this year out, we're basically back to<br>our long-term target. EBIT is bit of an extra situation because of the tax reform, but that will basically pan out over the next 1 or 2 years as well,<br>which means basically in sales and operating profit, we are back to our long-term targets.<br>
<b>Richard A. O'Leary</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - CFO and EVP<br>
Yes, I think for me, I would say the challenge in our primary objective in my mind for myself and Andreas is how do we balance the short-term<br>profitability versus the long-term goals of the business. And it's a constant conversation we are having across the executive committee as we get<br>updated views and evaluate the trade-offs. I think what's going to long term drive it is continue -- more sustainable growth on an ongoing basis.<br>We'll continue to invest in innovation that will enable us to maintain a strong and improving sales mix. We continue to focus on productivity every<br>year. But it's not -- I'm not going to sit here and tell you we're going to have another -- the kind of improvement we had over the last 6 or 7 years.<br>That's where we have to manage it. We have to make sure that we continue to drive our productivity agenda so that we can be competitive in the<br>marketplace and make then -- have the internal ability to fund incremental investments that are going to drive growth in the longer term.<br>
<b>Andreas Fibig</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - Chairman and CEO<br>
To build on this, actually that's the reason why when you see maximizing the portfolio, we spend a lot of our efforts and resources towards the<br>high profit categories like active cosmetics, which is very high, or Fine Fragrances. So while we have a good pipeline in place as well to get and<br>create some extra goals, particularly out of this area. Maybe there is one thing as we get frequently the question, are the smaller customers less<br>profitable than the bigger customers? It's not the case. They're actually even slightly more profitable than the bigger ones, just as an FYI.<br>
<b>Lauren Rae Lieberman</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
So R&amp;D spending probably hasn't gone up as much as I might have expected it to and yet it would seem the yield on your R&amp;D has gone up a lot,<br>as you are talking about the molecule additions and so on. So could you talk more about kind of profit changes there may have been to drive that<br>better yield? And then 2 areas where you are reinvesting in the business outside of the CapEx you just talked about and R&amp;D?<br>
<b>Andreas Fibig</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - Chairman and CEO<br>
No, and that's a very good one. What we did in terms of R&amp;D, we have streamlined our R&amp;D platforms. So we have now less platforms than we had<br>before, to really put the funds and the resources behind the most important projects. And I spent my life in research intense industries. It's about<br>the process and where you really put the money behind. And secondly, we have more invested into outside R&amp;D like PowderPure. We bought this<br>company for, what is it, $55 million. And that's -- it's actually considered an R&amp;D investment as well because we basically bought the technology.<br>So if you would put these things we have done on the M&amp;A side into the R&amp;D budget, you actually would see a growth, but it's not reported like<br>that.<br>

<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Andreas, I was hoping you talk a little bit about the level of customer activity that you see entering the year, just maybe by geography, by category,<br>across flavor and fragrances, big pickup of activity in volume growth in the fourth quarter, particularly in fragrances after a very slow start to last<br>year. Just is there anything different in the environment that you see today versus 12 months ago, kind of the sustainability of the recent trends<br>and outlook, as you think, into later this year and '19?<br>
<b>Andreas Fibig</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - Chairman and CEO<br>
Let me start -- that's very important. Let me start with the big picture. Actually I went to a Goldman event, and we talked about GDP growth in all<br>the regions. And I think that Rich mentioned it. It's probably since 2006, the first time that we see all regions have good and solid growth in terms<br>of GDP, which is seriously very helpful for us as well. So that's a positive momentum. The second positive momentum finally after so many years<br>with currency drag, we have some tailwind here as well. And what we have seen in the fourth quarter already is the pickup in volume. And I can<br>be very blunt and very honest to you. We saw it at the beginning. Is it just an inventory rebuild for many of our customers. But I said it on the<br>earnings call last week is what we see is it continues into the first quarter. So an elaborated guess is that we see some volume growth, in particular<br>in some of the emerging markets like Brazil, it's coming back for us in the fragrance business and it's a super important market. So volume growth<br>is happening. But what we see more is even more bifurcation of our customer growth. We have still customers, which have really a hard time to<br>grow their business, maybe because of the categories, maybe because how they approach the market, but others are actually very, very, very<br>successful going forward. Let me take 2 of these companies, L'Oreal and Est�e Lauder, for example, it's just going very well and they are big customer<br>of ours. So I think for us it's super important to figure out what are the right customers that we want to put our efforts behind and help them with<br>all the solution going forward. So again, a lot of macro factors are now in our favor. And we see a volume pickup. But it's not unisonal, it depends<br>also on the customer. I hope that helps.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
We have got Mark over here.<br>
<b>Mark S. Astrachan</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director<br>
Wanted to ask just firstly, how do you think about developing market growth? We have heard some companies talk about expectations for<br>improvement. I guess, how do you see it from where you stand? What might be a reasonable rate of growth as you sort of look out at that piece<br>of your business, which is obviously a pretty big chunk of what you do over the next year or 2 or 3? And then switching gears a bit, I wanted to ask<br>you about consolidation within the space. Not specific to you all engaging in it, very broadly, how would you think about value-add and doing<br>something like that where there would be, from a customer standpoint, opportunities to cross-sell products, create sweets, for example, of things<br>beyond just flavors and fragrances, and maybe, broadly as well how do you think about consolidation within the F&amp;F Group inclusive of whether<br>the customers who are all talking over the last few days and tomorrow about cost savings, productivity, how does that work in terms of trying to<br>keep a consolidated group of suppliers honest or do they invite more folks to start bidding on their business and, therefore, reducing the need or<br>want of consolidating?<br>
<b>Andreas Fibig</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - Chairman and CEO<br>
Okay. That's a lot of questions, Mark. Let me try to answer them all. Let's start with the emerging market. We see a revival. You see it and I talked<br>about Brazil. But we see it in Asia as well. India, very, very strong for us. That's one of the reasons why we're investing in U.S., sits on the ground<br>there. It's coming back. Interesting enough, even regions like the Middle East and Africa. Anyway that's good growth. So that's good because that's<br>supplementing our growth rate, in particular because we have 50% of our sales in emerging markets already. So that's really, really helpful. And<br>that was not helping in the last 2 years. On the consolidation front, in this space you have probably the 4 big players and then a couple of medium-size<br>players or small players. What we have done is with Ottens, David Michael, for example, Fragrance Resources, we did a rollup strategy of some of<br>the smaller assets to get geographic size or, let's say, focus on smaller customers. So that will probably continue. The big move, we discussed it's<br>

<A name=254></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 8:00PM, IFF - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group of<br>New York Conference<br>
in this industry for years, it depends on about the willingness of the partners to do it. But you mentioned something which is really important. I<br>believe that it is very wise not to look into your super narrow home turf of the F&amp;F business, but to look a little outside as well, as we did with the<br>active cosmetics, are there areas which are really helping, could help us to grow our market and to grow, let's say, the whole piece of the area where<br>we're playing in? And that's something as long as it creates synergies in terms of R&amp;D or in terms of our customer base, because usually they are<br>the same customers for active cosmetics, it makes a lot of sense. So we're looking at adjacent areas and if the opportunity presents, we are certainly<br>willing to go forward. On the cost savings side, we see certainly that, in particular, many of the bigger customers are very in the cost savings mode<br>still. I actually believe it is dangerous if you look at the top line they want to produce. And you could say, it's actually good for us because then we<br>are the company which has to deliver the innovation, which hopefully makes the products -- product grow. But it's not always the case. But we<br>don't see it in many of the midsize customers, which are quite investing in what they are doing. So I would say, again, here, it's a very mixed picture<br>and we have to figure out with whom are we playing and how we're playing. And another recipe against, let's say, cost pressure on our side is<br>certainly innovation, which can't be substituted. And as more innovative you are, better is your pricing position as well. And believe me, we certainly<br>do a lot in terms of putting a lot of pressures on our suppliers as well to make sure that if we get, let's say, some leverage on that side as well. Yes,<br>Lauren.<br>
<b>Lauren Rae Lieberman</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
I was just curious, as you're dealing with [the world mood] with clean labels, naturals so and so forth, are customers willing to pay up for that? Or<br>is it becoming an expectation that just they need a broader range of options and you need to provide it at the same cost structure?<br>
<b>Andreas Fibig</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - Chairman and CEO<br>
It's a typical answer. It depends. So if you have some of these very premium brands or premium customers, which you see in the Est�e Lauders of<br>the world and some of their sub-brands, they are very much willing to pay for this extra because they know that they get a new ingredient, which<br>is 100% natural and specifically, harvest and they can make also a marketing story out of it. I can tell you that there will be a perfume of Fine<br>Fragrance, which will be launched end of this year, early next year where we have a plant of rose in India where it makes a huge difference where<br>you harvest it in the morning or in the evening. We are harvesting it in the evening because it has much more of an animalic smell because it attracts<br>all the insects for the pollination. So we have customers who want exactly that and they pay a lot of money for it. And we have to figure out who<br>are these customers? What are these products? And how can we sell this in a best way? Is it going mass market? Probably not. And I give you an<br>example where it is fitting out right now. Everybody wants to have natural vanilla. But all of you who know a little bit about ingredients, natural<br>vanilla out of Madagascar was USD 20 per kilogram 3 years, 2.5 years ago. It was $550 last quarter. So it's very clear that many of them can't afford<br>that. Big staple products can't afford it, and they need more synthetic solution. So sometimes the wish is there, they want to do it. But they can't<br>afford it. So for us is to figure out who really can afford which product category and what can we offer, whether it's the India plant captured in the<br>evening or do we need something we have to provide to our customers, which is a synthetic solution, which I'm not against because profitability<br>of synthetic solution is pretty good as well. So that -- and you know we have 35,000 SKUs. Maybe for all the people who are not so familiar with<br>our industry, almost all of our products are tailor-made for these folk. And that's where we have to find out what fits to whom. Makes sense?<br>
<b>Lauren Rae Lieberman</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
Just curious of the working capital commentary. I think that was new in the focus on cash flow. Can you just -- any additional color on kind of how<br>you are going to pack that? Where do you think the biggest areas of opportunity, that would be great?<br>
<b>Richard A. O'Leary</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - CFO and EVP<br>
I think it's -- part of it is just execution in terms of we know what need to do -- we need to do, but we lost focus in 2017. I would say that's in probably<br>in the receivables area where we had an increase in overdues -- not at risk of nonpayment. I think on the payables side, it's continuing to stay close<br>to what's going on in market trends and market benchmarks in terms of our payment terms. We've got to get to a point where we have balance<br>between what our customers are paying us and what -- and what we are paying our vendors in terms of days payables or days sales outstanding.<br>

The challenging area we're going to have, particularly as I think about '18, is around inventories with some of the things that Andreas talked about,<br>whether it's vanilla prices or whether it's us dealing with the citral situation where our primary focus right now to make sure that we don't interrupt<br>supply to our compound customers. And if that means we're going to have to bring inventories up in the first half of the year, we're going to do<br>that. So I think it's going to be -- the improvements will probably be back-ended. I would see -- I expect to see the greatest amount of improvement<br>on the payable side. And then we'll see how things evolve in the second half of the year on inventories.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Could you tell us what's going into your estimated tax rate forecast for next year?<br>
<b>Richard A. O'Leary</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - CFO and EVP<br>
For this year, our current forecast is 21%. So it's a slight -- it's about 30- basis higher -- 30- basis points higher than where we ended '17. But at this<br>point based on what we know about tax reform and our current structure, forecast is 21%.<br>

I wanted to go back to the question on adjacencies. Just curious if you think about category growth, F&amp;F, at least the big 4 companies in the space,<br>if you go back, I don't know, 3, 4 years ago, were growing well in excess of what the overall category was growing, so clearly taking share. If you<br>back out acquisitions amongst that group, it seems like the rate of growth has slowed. I guess, is that fair that maybe some of that category growth<br>-- but if true for all these -- [seems that way] -- does that mean then that you want to go into more adjacent categories to try to stimulate growth<br>externally or inorganically, however you want to think about it. And then what categories if you think about enzymes, probiotic, color, et cetera,<br>would be most interesting to go into? You obviously, talked about (inaudible) the ingredients?<br>
<b>Andreas Fibig</b> - International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. - Chairman and CEO<br>
All of the above. No. But certainly you mentioned already the categories we are looking. It is actually interesting numbers. PowderPure, we are<br>already getting into natural colors because we're now capable of natural colors. And we're going segment by segment and look what really could<br>fit into our portfolio well.<br>

<A name=259></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, LSI - Q4 2017 Life Storage Inc Earnings Call<br>
Last night, we recorded adjusted FFO of $1.34 share for the fourth quarter against a pretty tough year-over-year comparison. During the quarter,<br>we acquired a state-of-the-art CMO property in downtown Charlotte, sold a non-core store at Salt Lake and another in Austin, continued the<br>ramp-up of our third-party management platform and refinanced $450 million of short-term debt beyond a 10-year note with a sub-4% interest<br>rate. We ended the quarter with 91% occupancy in our same-store pool and had over 90% for the total pool, both record year-end levels for LSI.<br>This puts us in good position starting 2018 after a year in which we fully completed the integration of 120 stores we acquired in 2016 and fully<br>completed the transition to the Life Storage brand.<br>
In the self-storage sector, consumer demand remains strong, and we see healthy demand across our markets, giving us increased confidence in<br>our prospects for growth in 2018. As we've said, demand for storage space typically outpaces population growth by a bit, and we continue to see<br>that with increased household formation. We also have been pretty successful in augmenting our residential customer base with more penetration<br>into the business sector, stimulating demand via our B2B programs. New supplies have been the headwind to our sector the past 3 quarters and<br>will continue to be so probably into 2019. While it's created pressure on rate growth, we believe the impact remains manageable as evidenced by<br>our ability to maintain strong occupancies.<br>
Supply levels vary greatly across markets, and as noted on previous calls, we faced our biggest challenges in the big 4 Texas markets: Houston<br>Dallas, Austin and San Antonio. In total, the properties in these markets comprise 23% of our same-store pool. To give some context to our exposure,<br>we have 116 wholly owned properties in Texas. And in the past 24 months, 77 stores have opened in these areas. We foresee up to 39 more in the<br>next 18 months. So these are expected to have a somewhat adverse effect in as many as 93 of our Texas properties going into 2019. But as we've<br>consistently said, these are rapidly growing vibrant markets that are ideal for self-storage. It's the cyclical drag that's causing us some pain now,<br>but mid to long term, we love this big Texas City and expect to benefit from our strong presence there. Other markets, which have some oversupply<br>concerns, include Chicago, Denver, parts of Phoenix and Miami. The impact to Life Storage resulting from new builds in these cities is not as strong<br>as it is in Texas, but there will be pricing pressure due primarily to the short-term disruption caused by move-in incentives. We're bullish at most<br>of Florida, St. Louis and much of the Northeast. While we're seeing some new supply in these markets, it's not always near us, and for the most part,<br>the construction has been warranted. The markets we've moved into last year, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Northern California, are likewise performing<br>well. With the exception of property taxes and Internet spend, operating expenses remain pretty well controlled, and we expect that to continue<br>for the coming quarters. But from all we can predict, property tax increases are going to remain a significant factor resulting in NOI growth.<br>
Looking at the transaction market, we've seen little movement in bid/ask prices over the past few quarters. Few data points exist, although a few<br>midsize reduced quality portfolios are on the market. There's continued strong interest from the private sector for storage properties of all<br>denominations. We're aware of the challenges to our sector with some markets needing time to absorb the recently built facilities and others just<br>about to see the start of some new constructions. But demand is there and the tools are in our kit for Life Storage to perform well even in this<br>competitive part of the cycle. These include proven marketing revenue management and customer service platforms, a well-developed B2B division,<br>opportunities across our portfolio expand and enhance our properties, a rock-solid balance sheet and strong operating cash flow. We entered 2018<br>confident that our largest scale, improved financial strength, stronger brand and greater presence will enable us to grow the value of our company.<br>
And Andy, with that, I'll turn it to you.<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
Thanks, Dave.<br>
As Dave mentioned, last night, we reported quarterly adjusted funds from operations of $1.34 per share compared to adjusted FFO of $1.31 per<br>share for the same period in 2016. These results were above the high end of our forecast, driven by better-than-expected same-store performance,<br>as well as CofO and lease-up store growth that exceeded our estimates. We have excluded from adjusted FFO the cost of interest rate swap<br>terminations and other charges associated with our debt refinancing that occurred in conjunction with our issuance of 10-year bond. Also excluded<br>from FFO was the cost related to Paul Powell's retirement, a valued member of our team, who retired after 20 years with Life Storage.<br>
Same-store quarterly revenue grew 1.3% as a result of occupancy gains. Same-store occupancy at December 31 was a fourth quarter record high<br>for our company of 91%, a 60 basis point increase over 2016 year-end occupancy. Fourth quarter same-store expenses outside of property taxes<br>

were well controlled by our teams, increasing only 1%. As noted on our previous call, we gained significant online traction with the Life Storage<br>brand early in the fourth quarter, which enabled us to reduce our Internet marketing spend to more normalized levels. As expected, property taxes<br>increased 8% in the fourth quarter with significant increases in Austin, Texas, Chicago, St. Louis and certain Florida markets.<br>
In addition to the improved performance of our same-store portfolio, we continue to see consistent growth trends at the properties that we<br>purchased at Certificate of Occupancy are very early in the lease-up stage. Even though we are in the traditionally slower season, average occupancy<br>for these lease-up stores increased by 260 basis points on a sequential quarter basis from 74.8% at September 30 to 77.4% at December 31.<br>
For Life Storage acquisitions, stores continue to grow occupancy with average quarterly occupancy at the 70 stable stores growing to 90.6% from<br>the prior year's 86.3%. The 11 non-stabilized Life Storage stores experienced occupancy gains ahead of expectations and had an average occupancy<br>of 86.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017, leaving additional room for growth in both pools. The overall fourth quarter revenue increase also reflected<br>a 49% increase in management fee income to $2.4 million as the strength of the Life Storage brand is resonating with independent owners.<br>
Fourth quarter G&amp;A costs were flat year-over-year even with the added $941,000 of officer retirement cost reported. We further strengthened our<br>balance sheet during the quarter by opportunistically refinancing $225 million of short-term bank debt and a portion of our line of credit. The new<br>10-year $450 million public bond carry some very attractive 3.875% rate. This transaction also significantly extended our debt maturity schedule.<br>Our weighted average debt maturity is now 7.8 years. At the end of the quarter, we had $9 million of cash on hand and $395 million available on<br>our line of credit. We have no debt maturities until December of 2019. Our debt service charge ratio was a healthy 4.9x and our net debt to recurring<br>EBITDA ratio was 5.6x. We acquired one newly constructed store during quarter in Charlotte, North Carolina for $12.5 million. We have no remaining<br>Certificate of Occupancy stores under contract.<br>
With regard to guidance, although we have achieved positive revenue trends in many of our top markets, we continue to see softness in other<br>markets due to new supply. From the expense side, we see pressure on payroll and benefit costs, property taxes and insurance. Nonetheless, we<br>expect a decrease in Internet marketing spend to keep overall expense growth in check. We have forecasted revenue growth for Q1 to be in the<br>1.25% to 2.25% range. And for the year, revenue growth is expected at 1% to 2%.<br>
Expenses outside of property taxes are expected to increase between 1% and 2% for the quarter and the year, while property taxes are forecasted<br>to increase 5.5% to 6.5%. Once again, we are not including in our same-store group any stores acquired as CofO that have not reached stabilized<br>occupancy above 80% at market rates as of January 2017. Our guidance assumes no acquisitions for our own portfolio nor does it reflect any<br>potential dispositions. As a result of the above assumptions, we are forecasting adjusted funds from operation for the full year 2018 to be between<br>$5.33 and $5.43 per share and between $1.24 and $1.28 per share for the first quarter of 2018.<br>
And with that, operator, we can open the call up for questions.<br>

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.<br>
<b>Juan Carlos Sanabria</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
Just with regards to guidance, can you quantify the benefit of now including Life Storage in the same-store pool? And -- yes, can we just start there?<br>Sorry.<br>

<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
Sure. There's about 105 stores entering the same-store pool in 2018. And that includes Life and some other acquisitions done earlier in the year,<br>including our California exposure and the -- Los Angeles. We expect that to add about 50 basis points to NOI. And we'll show that as we always<br>have. We'll show the different pools, so you'll see that what we expect's about 50 basis points of NOI.<br>
<b>Juan Carlos Sanabria</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
And do have a sense of what that does to the revenue line?<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
They're very similar.<br>
<b>Juan Carlos Sanabria</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
Okay. And then just with regards to some of the headwinds that you had that now should be drivers of growth. Can you give us any color on kind<br>of volume trends with the Google search? Kind of what you're thinking on the marketing spend? And your latest thoughts on the [ramp ups] to<br>existing -- kind of things you'd highlighted before that -- you talked of -- present opportunities for growth in '18?<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
Yes. The marketing spend, we would expect 4Q is probably a good run rate to use for 2018. Obviously, Google price is going up in the fourth quarter.<br>October was high for us and then it tailed off. So it's probably a good run rate to use for 2018. Q1, you won't see the big benefit because we didn't<br>have the heavy spend. 2 and 3, you'll see the biggest benefit, probably a -- it could be anywhere between a 10% and 20% reduction in those quarters<br>interim to that spend. Regarding in-place, as you already know, we're working on a few different scenarios. We would expect some different<br>strategies to be tested throughout 2018. Most of it -- most of those in-place increases will occur in April, May and June.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Robert Jeremy Metz</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Director &amp; Analyst<br>
Andy, I was hoping you could talk about the revenue trajectory in 2018. I guess, I would've thought that with the tougher first F comps, you'd start<br>lower and accelerate in the back half, but your 1Q guidance is going for slightly higher growth than your full year expectation. So any color here<br>would be great.<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
Sure. That's -- Jeremy, the Houston exposure will drive some of Q1. I mean, occupancy is still relatively high. It is burning off, as we thought it would.<br>Our rates are pretty strong in Houston. That's the good trends that we've seen so far, that the rates are -- come back to positive territory, which<br>they were negative for quite a good portion of 2017. So rates -- Street rates are positive. Occupancy is slowly burning off from the victims of that<br>hurricane. So that's really what's driving the front end of that.<br>

<b>David L. Rogers</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CEO<br>
And again, Jeremy, we're in the spot here where we don't have a lot of data points so that the -- the queries don't come in as often in January,<br>February and March. We're sitting here, waiting for the busy season to start, which has been a real tail. For 4 or 5 years, we really rolled through it<br>and came out of busy season really happy. And then in May of 2016 and again in '17, it was a little slower than we expected. And then that was a<br>-- that gave us some difficulties with regard to projections and guidance. So we're sitting here as we always do in the month of February giving<br>guidance without knowing how are price increases are going to work with the customer demand that's going to be. We feel pretty good sitting<br>here. But again, we're not going to lay it out there and expect a real pop. So it is -- we're looking forward to May. We'll have a lot more color after<br>Memorial Day, but this is the part of the year where we have a little bit difficulty with visibility.<br>
<b>Robert Jeremy Metz</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Director &amp; Analyst<br>
It does sound like you guys are in the game, that Houston will probably be a drag on revenue again in 2018, even if more modest.<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
I would think it's at the back half of 2018.<br>
<b>Robert Jeremy Metz</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Director &amp; Analyst<br>
Okay. And for my second question, Dave, the stock has come off in the past month, you're still a little above where you bought back stock in 3Q,<br>but not too far off. So should we expect to see the active buying back shares again here? Are you assuming any buybacks in guidance? And probably<br>you're going to look to balance this opportunity with adding further to the joint ventures?<br>
<b>David L. Rogers</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CEO<br>
Yes. We have not included any buybacks in guidance. We always look, Jeremy. It's a -- we have pretty strong cash flow. We've got places to put it<br>at times, but we're -- we didn't -- we haven't joined into any joint venture agreements as of February 21, but we may. So it's a balancing effort. And<br>certainly, we're not happy with the share price. And it becomes more and more compelling when there's a 7 in front of it. So we will -- as we have<br>in the past, as we did in the third quarter, we'll look at all the options and see what we have. And the one thing we've been pretty strong about is,<br>we're not going to leverage up certainly to buy shares back. But we do have a lot of free cash flow, and we'll allocate accordingly when we see the<br>best opportunities.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Todd Michael Thomas</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
First, I was just wondering if you could just talk about your strategy around discounting and promotions in '18 as the peak leasing season approaches.<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
Todd, it's very similar to what we've seen, that competitive pricing that we're seeing out there in the new supply, I think, we'll keep that elevated.<br>We're about 2.4% of revenue, same-store revenue as a concession of front. And I would think that is pretty similar to what you'll see in 2018. We<br>don't expect a big change in concession strategy.<br>

<A name=263></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, LSI - Q4 2017 Life Storage Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Todd Michael Thomas</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Are you seeing pricing power return somewhat? I mean, how are you thinking about existing customer and increases in '18? I think last year, you<br>dialed back a little bit on ECRIs. Are you planning to kind of maintain a similar level? Or do you think you'll push a little bit harder in '18?<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
We'll test a few strategies that may be more aggressive. But really you have to really watch the move-out rate. So as we go through and we test<br>some things, we'll see that move-out rate. And it's really about maximizing revenue. And sometimes pushing more customers is not always the<br>answer. But we would expect that we would test that -- some more aggressiveness throughout the year.<br>
<b>David L. Rogers</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CEO<br>
And having said that, Todd, we're -- we feel like we're in a bit of a stronger place with the web prices that we've regained. So we were more tenanted<br>last year than usual just because we didn't have that power that we needed in June, July and August to push rates. So pending regain in the web<br>prices, I think, we'll have a little more gumption.<br>
<b>Todd Michael Thomas</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And Dave, you talked about a few portfolios being on the market. Can you just comment on the company's appetite for investment here,<br>both maybe wholly owned or through joint ventures? And can you comment on sort of the size and scope of these portfolios? Maybe you can kind<br>of bookend what we're talking about in terms of size.<br>
<b>David L. Rogers</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CEO<br>
Yes. I think the quality of the ones that we've seen, the first 2 months of this year, would put us out in any capital structure scenario. They're just --<br>they just aren't there. They're in the $200 million to $250 million range, and they are C grade. They're not there for us or we would be very hesitant<br>and most unlikely to bring those to our JV partners. So that there's a stop at a time in the market right now isn't very compelling no matter what.<br>Obviously, with our cost of capital right now, we're not going to be big buyers for our own account, but we do plan on working with some of the<br>private capital that's out there to go along the road of the joint venture program. But right now, we didn't put anything in guidance to speak up<br>for the first couple of quarters because there isn't really a lot out there that we would want to have our flag up.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.<br>
<b>Ian Christopher Gaule</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - Associate<br>
This is Ian on with Ki Bin. I noticed you didn't break out Houston guidance for 2018. Could you share that with us? And what the same-store pool<br>looks like at Houston, please?<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
Yes. I would say, Houston, we expect to start the year relatively strong. Again, it was 0.1% growth in fourth quarter. We expect a little bit better to<br>start the year, but that would tail off as we go through the year.<br>

<b>Ian Christopher Gaule</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - Associate<br>
Okay. And what does the same-store pool look like without Houston? Is it just slightly higher than your guidance?<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
Yes. Just slightly different without Houston.<br>
<b>Ian Christopher Gaule</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - Associate<br>
Okay. And then can you just provide the Street rates for the fourth quarter and so far in January and February?<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
For the fourth quarter, we like the trends, they were down 2% on average for the quarter which trended better as the quarter went through. January<br>was down about 0.5% and February is flat. So we like the trends in Street rates. And that is really a forecast of things to come sometimes. So we<br>like what we see, at least, the trajectory of the Street rates, which has been as much as 6% negative in the middle of 2017.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies.<br>
<b>George Andrew Hoglund</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Research Analyst<br>
Just one thing in terms of kind of what's changed in the environment over the past couple of months since November NAREIT. Anything noticeably<br>better or worse since then?<br>
<b>David L. Rogers</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CEO<br>
In our slide -- aside from a little bit of seasonality, we're in our absolute slow period right now. It's -- the [nator] is typically end of February or<br>beginning of March as far as activity goes with regard to call volume and move-in to move-out. So this is -- we'd be surprised, I guess, if anything<br>had moved much between November and February. So now I think our perception of things looking into the year is a little better. We've got some<br>more grab with the Internet presence, so that's making us feel pretty good. The -- with our few rate increases that we have put in have stuck. So I<br>think we're feeling pretty good about the year. But again, there's not a lot of data points to latch onto and give you anything definitive in this<br>3-month period, especially.<br>
<b>George Andrew Hoglund</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And then just going back to guidance. I mean, you'd highlighted, kind of reiterated that, there's still a lot of uncertainty this early in the year.<br>But your same-store NOI guidance range is 100 bps versus -- peers have reported so far, it's 150 bps. I'm just wondering, given kind of the missteps<br>of guidance in the recent past, why not provide a wider range of same-store NOI guide?<br>

<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
George, I think when you look at what we're seeing now, what we saw in the fourth quarter, we're in line with the trends we see. We can't control<br>new supply pressure that comes on. The competitive pricing has been pretty strong. So it's tough to be more aggressive on those numbers. I think<br>our Internet presence, how that change -- where we went through about 9 months of 2017. As we improve that Internet presence, we're comfortable<br>with that now. But it's hard to predict any hard changes on that before we get into the busy season.<br>
<b>David L. Rogers</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CEO<br>
Well, I think as far as range goes, George, it's about 25 bps on either end. I think we -- that's the way we operate. That's -- you guys are pretty much<br>looking at the midpoint anyway, so cushioning to top and bottom is one way to do it. And -- but we feel -- we hold our people in the field at the<br>AM level, the RBP level, here in the home office, pretty tight to budget. I guess 25 bps on either end might give us something to hang on to. But at<br>the end of the day, we're -- we build off the midpoint. And that's our operating budget inside. So the range doesn't matter as much to us as maybe<br>you might think it would.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose Citigroup.<br>
<b>Bennett Smedes Rose</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Analyst<br>
I wanted to ask you just about the fourth quarter performance of the actual built, the Life Storage portfolio stable property for 70, the NOI there<br>went down year-over-year. And it looks like it was driven by a pretty sharp increase in expenses. Is that onetime in nature? Or is that something<br>that you -- would expect that level of increases moving forward?<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
Smedes, there were some onetime items in there that was property tax driven. The rest of the expenses are well controlled just like the rest of our<br>portfolio. But on the property tax land, we had some significant increases in Colorado and Austin, Texas that hit the fourth quarter about $300,000<br>of extra expense in that fourth quarter that I would've not expect to be continuing. That's not a...<br>
<b>Bennett Smedes Rose</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Analyst<br>
Okay. Okay. Okay. So nothing on the -- sort of operations side? It's more -- it was just more tax related?<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
No. No. Operating costs, we've kept in check. On the revenue side, we've seen nice increases in the occupancy, but they are coming at competitive<br>pricing and a lot of special. So I think that's held back the revenue growth there. But where the occupancy is now, which is at a good point. I think<br>it sets us up nicely for '18.<br>
<b>Bennett Smedes Rose</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Analyst<br>
Okay. And then just -- you mentioned supply growth in Texas. I'm just wondering, are there other markets where you're seeing significant supply<br>increases? Do you expect to come online across the course of this year?<br>

<A name=266></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, LSI - Q4 2017 Life Storage Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>David L. Rogers</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CEO<br>
Yes. I mean, it's nothing that we haven't seen for the last couple of quarters. We've been talking about Chicago. We've been talking certainly about<br>Miami and Phoenix and Atlanta. Again, Chicago impact is maybe a little bit more, but the others don't have anywhere near the impact of the Texas<br>markets. So yes, this -- it's in a lot of place. And I think it'll roll. I think we'll see supply rolling over the next couple of years. But I actually think as<br>much as we had Houston and Texas high on the list of problems, I think we've seen most of deliveries in Houston and Austin anyway. Dallas, we're<br>going to have some pretty significant deliveries, the balance, at least, affecting us the balance of '18 and into '19. But it rolls. If any -- and then you've<br>given to the absorption phase as opposed to deliveries. But we're looking at Houston and Austin now as perhaps by the end of this year, we won't<br>be talking about them so much. But then there'll be others. So -- and other companies have other markets that are impacted much stronger than<br>we are. So it's going to roll. It's going to be -- I fear a little bit of secondary and tertiary market development coming, and that's okay. But yes, it's --<br>those are the markets that we're watching now most closely: Southeast Florida, Chicago, Phoenix and Atlanta.<br>
<b>Michael Bilerman</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD and Head of the US Real Estate and Lodging Research<br>
David, it's Michael Bilerman. I guess, how much do you fear Public Storage's move into third-party management business? I mean, how much do<br>you feel that your existing management contracts that you've built up could be under attack from them as they come in and go to a low-cost<br>model?<br>
<b>David L. Rogers</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CEO<br>
Yes. We are a sort of an in-between model. And we've had some pretty good success. We share with our partners, our clients a greater part of the<br>insurance revenue. We work with them pretty closely on the spending, sharing and so forth. So we have had sort of a modified model like that.<br>And it's worked pretty well. I don't know the extend in this, but I think they sort of caught most of us by surprise yesterday. They have been such<br>voracious opponents of the strategy that this is a pretty big turnaround for them. So I think -- we turned down a lot of business that's in markets<br>where we don't think we can do a good job if we don't have scale. We don't want our third-party management client to be our first or second store<br>in a market that they're not -- we're not going to benefit much. I think that's where Public is going to go. So we -- yes, we're evaluating it certainly<br>because we didn't have any idea they were coming in here. We have to see what their marketing is going to be all about. But we had a pretty good<br>traction in the last few months even. We signed 18 stores over the last 6 weeks. We've got 32 more that we expect to be signed in the next few<br>weeks. I don't know. I think as a revenue generator, it's not a big thing for us. It's more a presence and a cost-sharing scale thing with us. So it's<br>really early to evaluate. I'm going onboard that I'd probably -- I'm qualified to speak on this yet because we have to see what they're going to do.<br>We have to see what their market is going to be about and how they're going to attack it.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from the line of David Corak with B. Riley FBR.<br>
<b>David Steven Corak</b> - B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division - Analyst<br>
I appreciate the color on Houston that you've given thus far, and that it will be a drag again by the second half. But you had kind of said that the<br>benefit of the hurricane would last through third quarter, you said, 4 quarters at least. Are you kind of changing that narrative here? Do you think<br>that the benefit is less so than you had initially anticipated? Or how should we think about that at this point?<br>
<b>David L. Rogers</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CEO<br>
I think as far as occupancy goes, we are seeing a little bit more burn off of occupancy. But what it did, I think, David, was -- would allow us the -- an<br>opportunity to get some pricing power back. And we put rate increases through in Houston, and they're sticking. We've got some of that back.<br>

<A name=267></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, LSI - Q4 2017 Life Storage Inc Earnings Call<br>
That's what we really lost. As Andy mentioned, we were down through that -- the lowest part of the down, 9% year-over-year. And we're even. And<br>I think we're going to see some of the price there ourselves. Yes, we have a little bit quicker drain on occupancy, although, we're still higher than<br>we were. But it has allowed us to use the opportunity to put in rate increases, and we've done that. So I would say we're -- at the end of the day,<br>we'll be about where we thought we would be at the -- when we were talking about it in November.<br>
<b>David Steven Corak</b> - B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division - Analyst<br>
Okay. Fair enough. And then one last one. I think one of the analysts touched on this already, but I just want to follow up. In terms of kind of your<br>same-store revenue, the cadence throughout the course of the year, obviously high 1% range in 1Q, but where do you think we end up by the<br>fourth quarter? Would you kind of bet it in? Should we assume there's kind of a straight line down for the full year? How should we think about<br>that?<br>
(technical difficulty)<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Okay. And then one more, if I may. And David touched on this, but in-place for rents were down year-over-year and I think this was the first time<br>in about 5 years, and I know you said that's a backwards indicator. But I'm just curious, was there a shift or conscious effort to sacrifice rate for<br>occupancy in the slower leasings?<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
No. I think as we went through '17, the Internet, as we change the brand on the web, we really had to use the concession and reduce rates to<br>maintain that occupancy, of which we wanted to go into '18 strong. And we think we're in a good spot from an occupancy point of view.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Right. And that should rebound kind of halfway through the year and be positive by the fourth quarter, hopefully?<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
It's tough to tell this early in the year, but that would be a reasonable assumption.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.<br>
<b>Ki Bin Kim</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Just one about the Life Storage portfolio, the stable properties on the 70. The revenue increase was only 80 basis points year-over-year versus last<br>quarter, it was up 20%. I'm not sure if there's a mix change or something. I mean, I know that the property can change by one, but that's a pretty<br>remarkable change. Can you talk about that, please?<br>

<A name=268></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, LSI - Q4 2017 Life Storage Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
Yes. Ki Bin, as I said, the Chicago market is the toughest one. And now those 18 stores in Chicago, the new supply that is affecting those stores, free<br>rent has been the way we've been combating that. It's been increasing occupancy. So it's -- the market is a great market. But the free month upfront<br>obviously hurts the revenue line pretty quickly. And there's been a lot of free rent in the Chicago market as we -- as these new stores lease-up.<br>
<b>David L. Rogers</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CEO<br>
But I think also -- and unfortunately, the third quarter comparison had 15 fewer days than in [2000]. So it was a 75-day period given. We bought<br>the stores July 15th of 2016. So the third quarter had 15 extra days and then, I guess, I think we indicated that somewhere. But yes, so they -- it<br>wasn't 20%. If we would have the 15 days ownership in '16, it would have been quite a bit less than that.<br>
<b>Ki Bin Kim</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Okay. That helps. And when you do your [A book] consistently you're testing out different pricing strategies and advertising. And when you're<br>doing your AB testing in China, push rents where you can. What's the general feedback you've been getting because your revenue growth is a little<br>bit weaker than peers? I know there's a market mix reason for that. But when you start testing for and try pushing a higher rents, what is the things<br>you're learning today?<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
Well, really what we learn from is the move-out rate. And we did some testing last year, as you said, going above Street rate. And we liked the<br>results we saw from that. But '17, as we went through the transition of the brand was not the time to be very aggressive with that. As we go through<br>'18, we may have more opportunities we'll see as we go through.<br>
<b>Ki Bin Kim</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Okay. And just last one from me. In your guidance for '18, are you implicitly thinking about any changes today, raising costs or rate increase program,<br>whether that be the level of the rate you push through or the frequency?<br>
<b>Andrew J. Gregoire</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary<br>
No. I know there hasn't been.<br>
<b>David L. Rogers</b> - Life Storage, Inc. - CEO<br>
There hasn't been a pause, although, as I mentioned, we feel quite a bit more confident with our ability to push rates in a sense that we have our<br>presence on the web. We have -- the brand is really established. So we are going to have more opportunities to push. And I think, given the tax<br>end -- and we do x amounts for months and weeks. And we really like to do it when the busy season is there. So that if we do lose customers, which<br>we will, somebody's there on the phone or through the web query ready to take their place in a hurry and hopefully, without too much of a discount.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of our time for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Rogers for any closing comments.<br>

<b>Gary A. Shiffman</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our 2017 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call.<br>
2017 was another exceptional year for Sun Communities and its shareholders. Our strong results and industry-leading internal growth are a direct<br>reflection of our team's intensive focus on execution as well as our best-in-class manufactured housing and RV portfolio.<br>
For the year ended 2017, Sun delivered a 10% increase in core FFO per share as we drove industry-leading same-community revenue and NOI<br>growth of 6% and 6.9%, respectively; saw a strong performance from the Carefree portfolio acquired in 2016, and added 9 operating communities<br>to our portfolio during the year. We ended 2017 with total portfolio occupancy of 95.8%, providing ample room for continued occupancy gains<br>across the portfolio.<br>

<A name=272></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, SUI - Q4 2017 Sun Communities Inc Earnings Call<br>
In 2017, we delivered nearly 1,800 manufactured housing expansion sites and over 300 RV expansion sites, bringing the total expansion site<br>deliveries to more than 2,100.<br>
We entered 2018 well positioned to once again deliver superior internal growth with expected weighted average same-community rental rate<br>increases of 3.8%, occupancy gains of 170 basis points and a full year of NOI from our 2017 revenue-producing site gains and acquisitions.<br>
The desirability and affordability of being a Sun resident was clearly evident throughout 2017 given the almost 49,000 applications received for<br>our available homesites, our highest total number of applications ever to live in a Sun community. Of these 49,000 total applications, almost 16%<br>of them were sales applications, a figure that has trended higher year-over-year for the past 5 years.<br>
This sustained demand for our product supports our consistently strong occupancy, ability to drive rental increases and helps fuel our home sales<br>business. In the fourth quarter, home sales grew by 11.6% as we sold 850 homes, and our annual home sales rose to a record of nearly 3,300 homes.<br>Of the homes sold during the year, approximately 1,200 or 36% were to existing renters who have elected to become homeowners in the Sun<br>community, continuing to demonstrate the effectiveness of our rental program's life cycle. We look forward to another strong year of home sales<br>as we continue to fill our available inventory.<br>
On that note, in 2017, we grew revenue-producing sites by nearly 43% as compared to 2016 by leasing over 2,400 sites. Of these, roughly 575<br>revenue-producing sites were filled in the fourth quarter. Over the course of 2018, we expect to fill between 2,700 and 2,900 revenue-producing<br>sites which will continue to drive elevated organic growth.<br>
During the year, we completed approximately $150 million of acquisitions in 9 operating assets, which added approximately 2,700 sites to our<br>portfolio and 1 land parcel. This included 2 properties for a total of $52 million acquired in the fourth quarter. These were a 201-site combination<br>manufactured housing and RV resort in Panama City, Florida for $19.5 million, and a 383-site age-restricted manufactured housing community in<br>Port Orange, Florida for $32.5 million.<br>
The land parcel purchase in the second quarter of 2017 is being developed into an 840-site RV resort in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. As we have<br>discussed in the past, this resort is one of several developments that we have underway where we feel we can capture high demand and create<br>value at a cost below acquiring existing properties in these areas.<br>
We currently have 3 development communities which will collectively add approximately 1,500 net sites as the projects are delivered in multiple<br>phases over the next several years. They include: Carolina Pines in Myrtle Beach, which I just mentioned; Cava Robles, a 332-site RV resort in California,<br>Wine County; and Jellystone Larks Bird, a 500-site redevelopment project just outside of Denver, Colorado. Of these, we expect to see Cava Robles<br>completed and open for business by the end of second quarter this year.<br>
Each of these new development properties represent 12 to 24 months of entitlement and permitting work prior to closing on the acquisition and<br>the land, we then develop.<br>
On the acquisition front, we continue to actively vet and underwrite a number of opportunities in both the manufactured housing and RV property<br>types, covering both age-restricted and all-age communities. Our strategy remains similar to 2017, as we pursue one-off transactions and small<br>portfolios that complement our footprint and offer the ability to create value.<br>
We've been strategically focused on constructing an operating platform that delivers compelling current returns as well as future growth. Our<br>portfolio of age-restricted and family communities and premier resort destinations reach a broad demographic with a common theme: the desire<br>to live or vacation in high-quality affordable communities. Our resident base is highly stable, providing a level of visibility on future cash flows that<br>is hard to replicate in other real estate asset classes.<br>
Consistent annual rent increases, opportunities to capture occupancy gains, the development and lease-up of our available expansion sites and<br>the conversion of transient RV sites to annual leases provide us with a runway to deliver sustainable, attractive results in 2018 and beyond. This<br>

solid operating backdrop, coupled with our strong balance sheet, led us to announce a 6% or $0.16 raise to Sun's common dividend of $2.68 to<br>$2.84 for the 2018 fiscal year.<br>
I'd like to thank the Sun team for their dedication and hard work during 2017, and I look forward to continuing 2018 with great enthusiasm. And<br>with that, I'd like to turn the call over to John and Karen to discuss our results and annual guidance in more detail.<br>
<b>John Bandini McLaren</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
Thank you, Gary. Before I begin sharing our performance metrics for the fourth quarter and the year, I wanted to note that our fourth quarter<br>performance was one of the strongest in our history. This level of performance would not have materialized without Sun's decades-long focus on<br>superior customer service and the constant refinement of our operating systems.<br>
Sun delivered a total portfolio revenue increase of 10.7% in the quarter and 17.9% for the year. Revenue increases across our different business<br>lines were also strong with manufactured housing revenues increasing 6.6% for the quarter and 13.5% for the year. Inclusive of the approximate<br>1,000 vacant manufactured housing expansion sites delivered during the fourth quarter, year-end manufactured housing occupancy was 94.6%.<br>Even when taking into account these expansion site deliveries, 132 of our manufactured housing communities exhibit 98% occupancy or greater.<br>We believe we have ample room in our portfolio to push manufactured housing occupancy higher and continue to deliver strong revenue growth<br>from this business line.<br>
Annual RV revenues rose 14.1% for the quarter and 41.9% for the year. Transient RV revenues rose by 14.1% for the quarter and 34% for the year.<br>Annual and transient RV revenues for Carefree included in total portfolio rose 14.6% and 1.3% for the fourth quarter.<br>
In addition, home sales revenues increased by 26.5% in the quarter and 15.3% for the year, as total homes sold increased by 3.5% for the year. Our<br>average new home selling price exceeded $118,000 for the quarter, with over 80% of new home sales occurring in Florida, South Carolina, Arizona<br>and Michigan.<br>
Along with a record average new home sales price for the fourth quarter, we also saw a margin improvement in new home sales of 170 and 100<br>basis points for the quarter and the year, respectively. We gained over 2,400 revenue-producing sites in our total portfolio, an approximate 43%<br>increase over nearly 1,700 revenue-producing site gains in 2016. 60% or approximately 1,400 of our gains were in manufactured homesites, and<br>40% or just under 1,000 sites, where RV transient to annual conversions.<br>
Our same-community portfolio continues to deliver solid year-over-year growth resulting from the strategic positioning of the portfolio over the<br>last 5 to 7 years. Revenues rose 6.4% for the quarter and 6% for the year, driven by a 3.6% weighted average monthly rental rate increase and a<br>190-basis point occupancy gain to 97.3%. This resulted in same-community NOI growth of 7% for the quarter and 6.9% for the year.<br>
Both revenue and NOI growth percentages exceeded our top end of our 2017 annual guidance range. Same-community manufactured housing<br>revenues rose 5.9% for the quarter and 5.7% for the year. For our same-community RV properties, revenues continued their upward trend with<br>annual RV revenues increasing by 8.3% for the quarter and 7.8% for the year, while same-community transient RV revenues were up 4.5% for the<br>quarter and 5.5% for the year.<br>
We've had a great start to the winter RV season, with budgeted first quarter 2018 reservations at 95%, ahead of this time last year by approximately<br>7%. Overall, for the year, we expect to achieve a mid-5% revenue growth contribution from our same-community transient portfolio despite a 7%<br>year-over-year expected decline in available transient sites.<br>
The decline in available site nights is a product for our transient site conversions to annual RV leases, where, as Gary has mentioned before, we<br>experienced a 40% to 60% revenue increase per site for the first full year after conversion. Our revenue management programs allow us to see<br>increases in revenue per available site to rate an occupancy optimization. We have also seen a tremendous growth through our digital marketing<br>efforts, where we engage you and repeat Sun guests through our broad range of social media and other traditional online campaigns.<br>

<A name=274></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, SUI - Q4 2017 Sun Communities Inc Earnings Call<br>
In addition, we expect to complete the construction of approximately 1,350 expansion sites in 2018, with 1,000 manufactured housing expansion<br>sites in 12 communities and over 350 RV sites across 4 resorts. Each of these operating metrics point to the exceptional capabilities of our operations<br>team to drive growth for our shareholders while maintaining outstanding levels of customer service to our residents and guests.<br>
Sun enjoys a number of attractive fundamental tailwinds, the increasing cost of site-built housing, the limited supply of high-quality affordable<br>housing and the strong demand for manufactured housing and RV lifestyles, leaves Sun well positioned to deliver industry-leading internal growth<br>for the coming years. Karen?<br>
<b>Karen J. Dearing</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
Thanks, John. Sun reported $0.98 of core FFO per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, in line with our previously provided guidance.<br>For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, core FFO per share was $4.17, up 10% from the prior year. Included in core FFO is an add-back for<br>lost earnings, net of insurance deductibles from the Florida Keys properties damaged during Hurricane Irma, which totaled roughly $300,000 for<br>both the quarter and the year. These properties are out of service and are now part of our redevelopment pipeline.<br>
As Gary detailed earlier, we acquired 9 operating communities for a total of $145 million and 1 land parcel for approximately $6 million in 2017.<br>Our deployment of roughly $150 million in acquisitions for the year is in keeping with our efforts to deepen our presence in the desirable and<br>complementary markets. 5 of the communities were located in California, 2 in Florida and 2 in the Midwest.<br>
With respect to capital markets, we were very active in the fourth quarter and early 2018, retiring high coupon debt and preferred units. These<br>transactions included the November redemption of our $85 million Series A Preferred Stock that carried coupon of 7.125%, the December and<br>January redemptions of $8.6 million of Series B-3 units with a coupon of 8%, and the December defeasance of the $38.6 million mortgage with a<br>5.25% fixed rate. Concurrent with the defeasance, we entered into a $100 million mortgage with an interest rate of 4.25% encumbered by the same<br>property.<br>
In January 2018, we have also retired $7.6 million of mortgages maturing in 2019, with a weighted average interest rate of 6.25%. Our forward debt<br>maturity schedule is well balanced and very manageable. During 2018, we have just $26.2 million of remaining loan maturities. We will continue<br>to pursue the restructuring or paydown of liabilities maturing in 2018 and beyond to drive down our cost of funds.<br>
At December 31, 2017, Sun had $3.1 billion of debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 4.5% and a weighted average maturity<br>of 8.9 years. Our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA was 6.3x, an attractive level that provides us the capacity to continue to support<br>our 2018 growth initiatives.<br>
On the equity side, we issued roughly 322,000 shares of common stock through our ATM program in the fourth quarter at a weighted average<br>price of $93.33, raising roughly $30 million. The proceeds of the ATM issuance were used so match-fund our acquisitions in the fourth quarter.<br>
Now let's turn to guidance. For 2018, we expect full year core FFO per share in the range of $4.48 to $4.58, and core FFO per share for the first<br>quarter of $1.12 to $1.14. Additionally, please keep in mind the following considerations. On the operating front, we are expecting a same-community<br>weighted average rental rate increase of 3.8%, and expect to capture same-community occupancy growth of roughly 170 basis points during the<br>year. We are anticipating full year same-community NOI growth of 7% to 7.5%. The same-community portfolio has increased to 336 communities<br>as compared to 231 communities in 2017, reflecting the inclusion of the Carefree portfolio.<br>
We are expecting an increase of 2,700 to 2,900 additional revenue-producing sites. Of the estimated revenue-producing site additions in 2018,<br>approximately 2/3 are in manufactured housing sites and 1/3 in RV conversions from transient to annual leases.<br>
Our core FFO guidance includes an add-back for lost earnings from the 3 off-line Florida Keys communities, which we expect to recover through<br>the business interruption insurance claim process. The estimate is based on historical NOI contributions from these properties and totals $1.3<br>million or $0.015 per share for 2018.<br>

I would also note that our guidance does not include any impact from prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which may be included<br>in analysts' estimates. Please refer to our supplemental document for additional guidance on home sales, same-community and core FFO seasonality<br>by quarter, general and administrative expenses, and other details. This completes our prepared remarks, and we'd like to open up the call to<br>questions. Operator?<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird &amp; Company.<br>
<b>Andrew T. Babin</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst<br>
A quick question on the deals that were executed in the first -- sorry, in the fourth quarter. Can you give cap rates on those deals? And I guess, give,<br>kind of, your update on what's out there in the transaction market? Whether anything has changed in terms of deal flow or I guess the volume of<br>opportunities that you're seeing?<br>
<b>Gary A. Shiffman</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Yes, sure. There's an awful lot in each part of that question. I'll start with the easiest. The blended cap rate for the acquisitions in the fourth quarter<br>was 5.5%. And then moving on to a little bit of what Sun's pipeline looks like, I think that I would suggest that it just remains very, very constant<br>and similar to what we've experienced for the last several years. And when you separate out the large portfolio transactions, in 2015, we did about<br>$100 million of single-type acquisitions; in '16 income, about $200 million; and in '17, $150 million. So with the pipeline that we see in front of us<br>right now, we would expect to be very, very similar to that average range in there. We're seeing and have under review manufactured housing<br>both age-restricted and all-age as well as RV resorts. I think we've got good, solid opportunity there. But I'd suggest that strategically we're very,<br>very focused on acquiring properties that can grow at least equal to our current portfolio, if not value-add opportunities where we can accelerate<br>outsized growth through management of systems and experience over here, like we've done in the past. That being said, what do we see in the<br>market? I would share with everybody that we continue to see contracting cap rates. I think that fundamentally, there is a lot more interest in the<br>asset category from both public and private investors. Generally, we talk about cap rates in the 5% to 7% range. And I can share with everybody<br>that we have seen transactions 100 to 150 basis points below that range and a lot less discernment between the quality of the assets. And even<br>the fact of whether they're age-restricted, all-age or in fact, RV communities. So, we're seeing that compression take place out there. Haven't really<br>seen any impact by interest rates, I think in large part due to the amount of equity interest in the asset class as well as the continued interest by<br>lenders, I think, for all the fundamentals that characterize manufactured housing and the RV resort. So whether it be the life companies, CMBS, or<br>other type of funding, it's still readily available and very, very competitive out there. So we're definitely very disciplined in what we're doing, but<br>the expectation from the existing pipeline we'll just continue to selectively acquiring properties as we've done over the past few years.<br>
<b>Andrew T. Babin</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst<br>
That's great color. And John, a quick question for you. In the last couple of days, we've heard some news about both building permits and housing<br>starts kind of jumping a little bit going into this year. Demand is strong and things like homebuilders are getting a little more active at the margin.<br>I guess, in your kind of experience, do you see any type of higher-density value-oriented amenity-heavy type of homebuilding going on in any of<br>your markets? Or do you see that as -- I guess, why are homebuilders trying to, in some way, capture this opportunity as far as [its restraints], things<br>holding them back, land scarcity. If you could just speak to that a little bit and just give us an update on whether you're actually seeing anything<br>on the ground in that forum?<br>

<A name=276></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, SUI - Q4 2017 Sun Communities Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>John Bandini McLaren</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
Yes. So my thoughts on that, Drew, are -- it's -- obviously, within our communities, it's a whole different lifestyle, and it goes frankly, a little bit<br>beyond even the amenities. Amenities support it, and we've got a very, very healthy stack within our communities to do that. But really, it has to<br>do with the experience that happens on the property. I think one of the other sort of distinctions between us and maybe some of this going on is<br>the fact that there are still -- when you're looking at stick-built single-family, the barrier to entry is higher from a financial outlay standpoint for<br>somebody to buy a single-family home as compared our product. And so when you look at sort of the square footage values that we have by<br>comparison, and then like I said, the amount that they have to pull out of pocket to that, I think it puts us into an advantage, because I don't -- the<br>only thing that really kind of -- and we've talked about this before, impact at us was before the mortgage crisis, when there was unqualified credits<br>that were allowed to buy single-family homes. And so that still factors into us. So I still think that from a competitive standpoint, whether it's the<br>amenities themselves, the experience at the properties and the barrier to entry to own a home puts us still at an advantage.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.<br>
<b>John Ellwanger</b><br>
This is John here with Nick. A question on the same store. Could you quantify the benefit to 2018 same-store NOI growth from adding the new<br>properties to the same-store pool?<br>
<b>Karen J. Dearing</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
Adding the Carefree communities to the pool?<br>
<b>John Ellwanger</b><br>
Yes.<br>
<b>Karen J. Dearing</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
So, yes. As we've said in the past, when we purchased Carefree, and as we underwrote that, we did anticipate that Carefree would be outperforming<br>our core portfolio. And in fact, that is what is occurring. That acceleration of the same-community NOI growth to 7% to 7.5% from where we were<br>in '17, is really driven by that higher growth rate in the Carefree portfolio than in the core portfolio.<br>
<b>John Ellwanger</b><br>
And I guess, along those lines, how long would you expect that to occur for us? Or how much longer at a year or 2 for that outsized clip, roughly?<br>
<b>Karen J. Dearing</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
Yes. When we looked at it, it was for another -- how should I say this? We underwrote it -- after our first year of acquisition, it would outperform our<br>portfolio for another 2 to 3 years.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from the line of John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.<br>
<b>John P. Kim</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior Real Estate Analyst<br>
You guys mentioned in your prepared remarks about increasing your revenue-producing sites. Your main competitor in public space, DLF, said<br>pretty much does the same thing on expansion opportunities. What about the private owners? I mean, do you get a sense that they're expanding<br>as quickly as possible just given the strength in the market? And how do you see new supply this year versus in recent years?<br>
<b>Gary A. Shiffman</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. It's Gary, John. I think that we've shared before that in the backdrop of what we're aware of going on in our markets and across the country,<br>there's certainly very little new greenfield development, although there is a pocket here or there we're starting to hear about right now. And Sun,<br>of course, has been focused on the new development side. We're trying to deliver 2 to 3 communities per year. And other than that, nothing on<br>the new development. On the expansion side, I would say it's really unchanged. I can't point to anything, and I'd ask John, that it's different today<br>that we see expansion-wise across the general board. We did note that our competitors, I think, were looking at expanding their communities at<br>a rate probably much higher than in the past. And I think that as we've shared, it's a very healthy way for us to create growth, the fixed place -- fixed<br>costs are in place, and the margins are higher when we expand. But I can't really sit here and tell you that we are aware of a lot of other expansion<br>taking place out there. It does play a big role in acquisitions, as I've said before, where we can acquire properties that have contiguous land that<br>either comes with the acquisition or that we can acquire separately. It's strategically important for Sun to continue to gain that type of extra additive<br>growth. So, what I would say is that most of what I see out there is opportunities on acquisitions that might have some embedded expansion<br>opportunity in it, but not a lot that I see that's really taking place out there.<br>
<b>John P. Kim</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior Real Estate Analyst<br>
Could you give us a ballpark on new supply this year in MH and RV?<br>
<b>Gary A. Shiffman</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. Manufactured housing, new supply, we're doing 2 to 3 communities. And if there's another 2 to 3 communities going on across the entire<br>country, I am not aware of them. Same is true basically on RV and MH. I may be aware of a handful, 3 to 5 communities, owners that I've spoken to<br>in one way or another, either for acquisition purposes or other purposes, that might have expansions pending. So you might put that at maybe a<br>dozen across the country. And again, these are just estimates. And I'll turn it over to John, are you aware of anything on that?<br>
<b>John Bandini McLaren</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
No, that's okay. I would echo what you said before, too, Gary, which is that -- I mean, similar to what we're talking about what some of these -- with<br>the previous question today, I mean, the barrier to entry is difficult. The entitlement process is difficult, the zoning process is difficult. It can take<br>12 to 24 months to get through that process. And so it's just -- it's hard to do, which I think plays into the fact why there's just not that much going<br>on. That's part of it.<br>
<b>John P. Kim</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior Real Estate Analyst<br>
Okay. And then John, you mentioned that the 2018 RV reservations are at 95% in the fourth quarter and it's up 700 basis points. What is that driven<br>by? Is that the strong economy or are there other factors?<br>

<b>John Bandini McLaren</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
Well, I think a lot of it, frankly, is driven by -- obviously, there's a lot that we do from a social and a web online presence that drives a lot of business<br>to our communities. But I think more important than that is really what we -- what happens at the resort itself, okay, and it's really -- it's that<br>experience that happens on the ground. Because when we -- we have a lot of focus on service and the relationship that we have with our guests<br>and residents and what that turns into is really building your resident and guest sales force for your brand. And that by itself is our largest segment<br>of marketing that we have. And so it's -- it really is a product of that. And I think one of the things that really is the biggest example or that<br>demonstrates that is the success that we've had in having guests that were transient guests become annual guests in our communities. We've had<br>-- we grew by nearly 1,000 sites in 2017 with that conversion. And when they do that, I mean, they're committing to being there for the long-term.<br>So that's I think -- again, I think what happens on the ground drives that the most.<br>
<b>John P. Kim</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior Real Estate Analyst<br>
Okay. And then finally I had a question on your guidance, especially on the expense side it looks like property, operating and maintenance you're<br>expecting 2.8% increase at the midpoint. In the fourth quarter, you had payroll increase of 8%, legal tax and insurance, 16% increase and there was<br>also kind of other. But how do you manage the OpEx being -- [going so low] compared to the fourth quarter and maybe compared to inflationary<br>pressure?<br>
<b>Karen J. Dearing</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
I think that we're known for our operating expertise, and certainly, it's just a focus that we have internally. Last year, we did have some increases<br>in health care claims and some utility costs and things like that. I don't think that the guidance for the year-to-date for last year, expense growth<br>was 3.8%. And so, we're guiding to a little bit less than that in this year at the midpoint at 3.3%. And in -- we're very active in our real estate taxes<br>also as far as -- I just lost my train of thought really. Assessment -- fighting assessments that come in. And we've been really successful in receiving<br>some refunds on our prior assessments for our communities.<br>
<b>Gary A. Shiffman</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. The only thing I would add is fundamentally for those who want to really look at one of the main characteristics of operating these communities<br>is that we don't have any real vertical structures. We don't have things to maintain like the apartment or multifamily does. The customer that owns<br>their home is responsible for maintaining their own lawn, their own site. So the actual areas where we can come under pressure, I think, are just<br>fewer. That doesn't mean we don't experience the inflationary increases and other related increases, but they are a lot smaller in total than other<br>asset classes.<br>
<b>John P. Kim</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior Real Estate Analyst<br>
And can you just remind us what's in the other bucket in OpEx? Because that's the one that's kind of moderating last year's expense growth.<br>

<b>Karen J. Dearing</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
Yes. Advertising is in there, bad debt expense is in there. Those are the 2 that are coming to my mind right now.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.<br>
<b>Joshua Dennerlein</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Could you maybe walk us through, like, how the Board got to the 6% dividend increase this year? Do they kind of thing about it as a percentage<br>of AFFO payout?<br>
<b>Gary A. Shiffman</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. I think that there was a -- it's Gary, a lot of deliberation and careful thought that went into it. We have been a company that most recently has<br>used as much of our retained earnings and definitely been into the equity marketplace to restructure the balance sheet, to grow the opportunity<br>for the shareholders through the transformational acquisitions. And with much of that behind us right now, we did think it was in order to increase<br>the dividend for the shareholders. And I think part of that certainly was looking at AFFO and a lot of other metrics, seeing how the company is<br>positioned against the rest of the company's -- the REITs that are out there. And so I'm comfortable that we were very, very close to the average<br>range and that's helped govern us along with how we viewed growth in the company through 2018 and the foreseeable future. And it was all of<br>those types of things that went into the thought process to arrive at that dividend increase.<br>
<b>Joshua Dennerlein</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And also for the revenue-producing sites in 2018, in the figure, you're forecasting 2,700 to 2,900, how much of those sites are just from pure<br>occupancy gains versus expansion sites that you've built out but aren't revenue-producing yet? Is that something that you'd want to break out?<br>
<b>Gary A. Shiffman</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Do we have that?<br>
<b>John Bandini McLaren</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
I think approximately 1,200.<br>
<b>Karen J. Dearing</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Executive VP, CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
It's just about -- I think it's like 1,200.<br>

Is with expansion site [fills].<br>
<b>Joshua Dennerlein</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
And then just one last one from me. For 2018, you're forecasting at 3.8% weighted average monthly rent increase. How does that compare to<br>historical rent bumps? And is there any possibility that as inflation picks up, you could see the monthly rent increase going forward accelerate?<br>
<b>John Bandini McLaren</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
Yes, so this is John. I think that -- well, to give you some history, I think approximately our rent increase in 2016, weighted average was 3.4%, which<br>went to 3.6% in 2017, and now like you said guidance of 3.8% for 2018. And it continues to be at the higher end of the 2% to 4% range that we've<br>gotten for the last 20-plus years. I think it's important to note that high occupancies provide multiple benefits. And one of the things I think that<br>differentiates Sun is our experience and expertise in filling vacant sites and creating additional avenues for growth. We create lease-up opportunities<br>by expanding our existing communities, acquiring communities on an accretive basis with additional vacancies to fill and by building new<br>communities. And really associated with the lease up of those occupancies that we buy or create are the multiple levers that we talk about that<br>drive overall growth. Those levers are rent increases, but also include occupancy gains, home sales, conversion of transient RV sites to annual<br>seasonal sites. And of course, rent increase drives solid year-over-year growth, but it's only one of those levers. And I think it's important that -- to<br>us, it's important to strategically balance all those different levers as we try to optimize the annual revenue growth and maximize the returns for<br>shareholders.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.<br>
<b>Todd Jakobsen Stender</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Senior Analyst<br>
And just on the timing of those new expansion sites coming online, can you estimate when they're coming? How long they take to generally fill<br>up, just to get a sense of maybe the dilution you're assuming? And then if it's quicker than expected, maybe the little upside?<br>
<b>Gary A. Shiffman</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. It's Gary, and then John, you can add anything else in. But I think the way that we look at it is occupancies in the expansion are generally 4 to<br>8 per month. As John and Karen shared, we're looking to fill up about 1,200 of the over 2,100 sites that were developed in '17. So, the lag is really<br>as we build sites in 2018, they won't be filled in until 2019. I think any dilution is kind of built in from the standpoint that in '17, we did 2,100 and<br>'18, we'll be doing somewhat less. So, we would expect to see a slight pickup as these sites are filled versus the amount of capital being put out in<br>2018 for new sites. And finally, with regard to how we look at things that if we're going to fill 1,200 sites this year, they'll fill sort of ratably over the<br>year. So, we expect the full benefit to equal something like 50% on the weighted average of what we'll experience in additional revenue from those<br>sites.<br>
<b>Todd Jakobsen Stender</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Senior Analyst<br>
And I guess just switching back to the renter to owner conversions. Can you speak to the length of stay that you're seeing the renters rent before<br>they buy? And then maybe just go through the cost difference of renting versus owning.<br>

<A name=281></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, SUI - Q4 2017 Sun Communities Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>John Bandini McLaren</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
Yes. I mean, generally speaking, our average renters in the home between 18 and 24 months. That's been the case for a long, long time we've had<br>the program. Generally speaking, the rents within that program have continued to grow and even in comparison to other multifamily and certainly<br>other rental opportunities that are out there on the market. It's -- once again you're in a situation within Sun's communities where we've got<br>amenities and other services that are provided that are different than some of the others out there. And one of the things that Gary noted during<br>his remarks was that 36% of our home sales were to existing home renters, which is -- it's 1/3 of our sales. It's over 1/3 of our sales. I think one of<br>the things that I -- that -- really that process of having a rental home program is one of the things that fuels our sales overall and brings in new<br>revenue into Sun. And I think it's important to note that out of the 3,282 homes that we sold in 2017, which was a record, that 1,600, or nearly 50%<br>of those homes were -- had previously been rented. And what does that do? Is it -- I think it's a strong indicator of the demand that we continue<br>to see for our homes and our communities. And ultimately, for that incremental gain above the 1,200 or so that we sold, it generates a new revenue<br>stream on top of that versus somebody simply converting as a renter to an owner within the community.<br>
<b>Todd Jakobsen Stender</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Senior Analyst<br>
Can you quantify some of that just to get a sense of what your site rent is? And if you can convince someone to now own it, maybe their [amount<br>of] loan payment is actually less than renting. Is there that dynamic?<br>
<b>John Bandini McLaren</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
Yes. Yes.<br>
<b>Gary A. Shiffman</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Interestingly enough, we've always shared with the market that we do see high-teen returns on our capital invested in the rental program. And<br>we do, in fact, trade off some FFO when we convert them into a homeowner. However, the concept that I'd remind everybody is that with the<br>average turnover of homes moving out of our portfolio less than 2% a year, and another 6% to 8% that actually sell their homes but we get<br>continuous rent. Once we convert from a renter to an owner, we have an income stream of a minimum of 40-plus years then. And so while we do<br>lose a little bit of FFO, we do gain that security of the income stream.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Mr. Shiffman, there are no further questions. I'll turn the floor back to you for any final comments.<br>
<b>Gary A. Shiffman</b> - Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Well, we'd certainly like to thank everybody for participating on our year-end fourth quarter call. We do look forward to having everybody join us<br>for our first quarter earnings call. And both John, myself and Karen, always encourage anybody to fill free to reach out to us for any additional<br>information. Thank you.<br>

<A name=285></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, EIX - Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thanks, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone.<br>
Edison International delivered excellent fourth quarter and full year results, but we faced significant challenges in December and into January of<br>this year due to wildfires and the related legal and regulatory framework in California. Governor Brown recently referred to a new normal with<br>respect to wildfires and the fundamental risks this poses to our utility are top of mind at all levels of our company. I will discuss our strategy to<br>address wildfire risk, but first, let me make a brief comment on our full year results.<br>
2017 core earnings were $4.50 per share, which were $0.18 above the midpoint of our earnings guidance range and also well above consensus<br>EPS. These results were driven by SCE's strong operating performance and additional tax benefits during the year. The EIX holding company also<br>had better-than-expected cost performance in the fourth quarter and has contributed to our positive overall results. These results exclude the<br>noncore impact of tax reform and the revised SONGS settlement.<br>
Today, the Board of Directors of Edison International declared its first quarter common stock dividend of $0.605 per share. Prior to declaring the<br>dividend, the Board evaluated the information available, including information pertaining to the wildfires in December 2017 and the mudslides<br>in Montecito in January 2018 and determined that the California law requirements for the declaration were met.<br>
Wildfires pose a risk statewide, impacting the entire economy. Communities across California have been tragically affected as climate change has<br>increased its severity and the frequency of wildfires in recent years.<br>
Long-term droughts in California and forest management policies have resulted in the buildup of unmanaged vegetation. The state has nearly 130<br>million dead trees on approximately 9 million acres due to prolonged drought conditions and bark beetle infestation. The combination of these<br>conditions along with decades of more buildings being permitted and constructed in higher fire risk areas have contributed to catastrophic wildfires<br>with 8 of the state's 20 most destructive wildfires having occurred in just the last 3 years.<br>
This is a statewide crisis that needs a statewide solution. We are engaged with state leaders, including the governor's office, legislative leaders and<br>stakeholders across the economy on the solutions we believe are needed.<br>
First and foremost is the prevention and mitigation of catastrophic wildfires with sufficient fire suppression resources and effective policies around<br>vegetation management, hazardous fuels reduction and zoning regulations for residential and commercial development in high fire risk areas.<br>Second, our state's infrastructure must be hardened with stronger building codes in high fire risk areas. Utilities and other operators of critical<br>infrastructure must also partner with state agencies on improved standards for climate-resilient infrastructure.<br>
As we think about how we design and operate our system, we should consider that roughly a quarter of our service territory is in designated high<br>fire risk areas. This should evaluate the safety impacts along with the reliability and cost tradeoffs of steps like undergrounding more of the<br>distribution network in selected areas, installing steel or composite poles instead of wood ones in specific locations and using further preventive<br>public safety shutoffs of power under high risk conditions such as red flag warnings, which we have done selectively in the past.<br>
Third, when a catastrophic event occurs, in spite of all these efforts, we need thoughtful policies around how financial risks are allocated, including<br>fire suppression costs and damages.<br>
As a reminder, California's courts have held investor-owned utilities strictly liable regardless of fault, for property damages and attorney's fees if<br>utility equipment is found to be a substantial cause of a wildfire. This means that the utility can do everything right in the operation and maintenance<br>of its equipment but still be on the hook for these costs. The California courts have held utilities liable regardless of fault by applying the principle<br>of inverse condemnation, a principle typically applicable to government, not to private entities.<br>
The assumption is that like a government entity that can pass along to its taxpayer's costs and risks incurred for the public good, IOUs can socialize<br>wildfire costs among their customers in rates. However, as many of you know, the CPUC recently denied San Diego Gas and Electric's application<br>for cost recovery of about $380 million of costs above their insurance coverage.<br>

<A name=286></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, EIX - Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call<br>
We see legal, regulatory and legislative policy pathways to resolve these issues.<br>
Starting with the legal front. We recently filed a motion in our Round fire case, a 2015 fire near Bishop, California, challenging the application of<br>inverse condemnation. Yesterday, we filed a motion for leave to file an amicus in the PG&amp;E Butte fire case, also challenging the application of<br>inverse. In the regulatory arena, we filed a joint application with PG&amp;E for rehearing of the CPU's decision in SDG&amp;E's wildfire expense memorandum<br>account or WEMA application. We also recently filed comments in PG&amp;E's Butte fire WEMA.<br>
On legislative policy changes. In addition to the priorities I mentioned on fire prevention and suppression and improved standards climate resiliency,<br>we believe that the allocation of costs and financial risks must be addressed. That starts with exploring ways to reform the application of inverse<br>condemnation with strict liability to utilities. It also includes addressing the high cost of fire suppression, which typically exceeds state budget<br>levels each year. In addition, increasingly high premiums for wildfire insurance coverage should be a part of the discussion as they affect parties<br>far beyond the utility sector.<br>
I would like to note that despite our best efforts and great sense of urgency here, all of this will take time and creates uncertainty. However, we<br>also believe that the state will ultimately address the risks and issues surrounding wildfires and other climate change impacts because California's<br>ambitious environmental policies require strong, healthy utilities.<br>
On that note, I would like to now touch on a few key trends that we continue to see providing a strong growth engine at the utility for the foreseeable<br>future.<br>
Last October, SCE released a white paper that outlines our blueprint for California to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution by its<br>ambitious 2030 goal. The clean power and electrification pathway has received a great response and support from community organizations,<br>customers, environmentalists and labor unions.<br>
As you have seen in the white paper, we estimate that to meet the 2030 goals, California must have a robust modern electric grid supplied by 80%<br>carbon-free energy. We believe California will need more than 7 million electric vehicles and the electrification of 1/3 of space and water heaters<br>in increasingly energy efficient buildings. We continue to engage in significant outreach to key stakeholders and pursue initiatives to help the state<br>meet California's 2030 goals.<br>
A related initiative is the transportation electrification application that was filed in January 2017 that included $574 million of potential capital<br>spending in 2 groupings: fast track projects and larger, longer-term projects, which will require more detailed consideration.<br>
Last month, the commission approved 5 of the 6 fast-track priority projects we proposed but only $10 million in capital spend. The commission<br>process continues with respect to the longer-term review projects, and we are still expecting a proposed decision in the second quarter.<br>
Energy storage is a big component of the electric grid in our analysis. Legislation is beginning to reflect this as well and Assembly Bill 2868, signed<br>in 2016, added opportunities for programs and investments of an additional 500 megawatts of distribution level energy storage systems distributed<br>equally among the IOUs, so SCE share is 166 megawatts.<br>
On March 1, we will file our energy storage procurement and investment plan application, which will include AB 2868 proposals for energy storage<br>programs and investments in addition to the usual procurement of energy storage through other RFOs.<br>
With respect to the 2018 General Rate Case, we filed updated testimony in February 16 to reflect the impacts of tax reform. We have a hearing date<br>set for March 19 to discuss this updated testimony and any comments provided by intervenors. Once that hearing is completed, we will see if the<br>administrative law judges require any other briefings before issuing a proposed decision. We cannot speculate on the timing for a proposed decision<br>and a subsequent commission decision, but I'll say that given where we are today, we would expect the final decision before year-end.<br>

<A name=287></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, EIX - Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call<br>
Turning to SONGS. We announced our revised settlement that was a result of multiple mediation sessions in 2017 and January 2018 with that<br>diverse set of parties. We weighed the reasonable range of potential outcomes and determined that this outcome is in the best interest of our<br>customers and our shareholders.<br>
If approved by the CPUC, this settlement will eliminate further uncertainty and it will bring closure to what otherwise could have turned into very<br>lengthy litigation after factoring in likely appeals in the absence of settlement. The revised settlement will resolve all issues under consideration<br>in the OII and will also result in the dismissal of a federal lawsuit currently pending in the Ninth Circuit Court of appeals, challenging the CPUC's<br>authority to permit rate recovery of San Onofre costs. Maria will provide additional information in her remarks. But in summary, our 2017 financial<br>statements reflect the impacts of the revised settlement in our company. We will work with the other parties to complete the steps in this proceeding,<br>and we are hoping for a swift commission decision given that all the parties involved in the mediations are willing to settle.<br>
I would like to now touch on a few of the key nonfinancial metrics our board uses in measuring our performance in delivering safe, reliable clean<br>and affordable electricity to our customers.<br>
While we had challenges in 2017 with some of our goals, we saw strong trends in the second half of the year and we will work hard to meet or<br>exceed the 2018 goals approved by our board.<br>
Operational and service excellence starts with safety for our workers and for our public. This has been a major priority across our company and is<br>at the top of our core values.<br>
Our 2017 performance did not meet our expectations. For example, our rate of injuries leading to days away, on restricted duty or transferred<br>known as the DART rate remains worse than industry norms. We have dedicated additional senior leadership in this area and are focused, not just<br>on tools and processes, but much more importantly, on growing the safety focus of our organization's culture.<br>
We continue to improve in our customer service goals with residential customers, with SCE ranking in the upper second quartile among peer<br>utilities in the most recent J.D. Power survey, we have narrowed the gap with our top quartile peers and first quartile appears achievable for SCE.<br>
On the business customer side, our peers continue to raise their performance, and so we have dipped into the upper third quartile. Kevin, his<br>leadership team and our employees will continue to target top quartile satisfaction for both our residential and business customers.<br>
While SCE did not meet its 2017 reliability goals, the utility began implementing a 3-year improvement road map in 2017, and the benefits realized<br>in the second half of the year exceeded our expectations. We expect reliability to continue to improve in 2018 with the goal of achieving top quartile<br>performance over the next few years.<br>
SCE achieve improved cost performance in 2017. One way we measure SCE cost efficiency is controllable O&amp;M per customer. We also track system<br>average rates. SCE continues to reduce O&amp;M costs and maintain the lowest system average rate among California IOUs and is on track to achieve<br>top quartile performance. We have plans that should help us achieve this objective over the next couple of years.<br>
As we continue to pursue top quartile performance across all of these operational metrics, we know that the bar will continue to be raised as we<br>and our peer utilities take advantage of technological and analytical advances to improve outcomes. So while we have plans to achieve top quartile<br>performance based on current benchmarks, we know that we will need to work to push past those levels in order to keep pace.<br>
As I look ahead to the changes that will take place in California, our utilities<br>
[audio gap]<br>
to operate a safe, reliable grid, achieve environmental policy outcomes and mitigate climate change impacts. Our customers, regulators, legislators<br>and shareholders can rely on our employees to deliver solutions to the many challenges facing our community, and to do that from a strong<br>foundation of operational and service excellence.<br>

<A name=288></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, EIX - Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call<br>
With that, let me turn it over to Maria.<br>
<b>Maria C. Rigatti</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone.<br>
My comments today will cover fourth quarter and full year results for 2017 compared to the same period a year ago, our updated capital expenditure<br>and rate base forecasts, updates on SCE's FERC formula rate filing and other financial updates for SCE and EIX.<br>
Our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results includes certain noncore charges related to the recent tax reform legislation as well as the revised<br>SONGS settlement. I will walk through both of these in a minute, but let's begin with a look at our core earnings drivers.<br>
For the fourth quarter 2017, Edison International reported core earnings of $1.10 per share, an increase of $0.13 from the same period last year.<br>
On the right side of Slide 2, you will see that SCE had a positive $0.14 core variance for the quarter versus the prior year. This is mainly attributable<br>to $0.11 per share of increased revenue related to the attrition mechanism in SCE's 2015 General Rate Case.<br>
There were a number of changes on the expense side as well, although these were largely offsetting. SCE's operations and maintenance costs were<br>slightly higher due to the timing of maintenance activities. Net financing costs increased $0.01 per share over last year and was mainly due to $0.04<br>of higher interest expense, partially offset by increased AFUDC earnings. Income tax benefits were $0.05 per share higher than last year and related<br>to increased cost of removal benefits.<br>
Finally, other costs related to property taxes and corporate expenses were $0.03 higher.<br>
For the quarter, EIX parent and other had a negative $0.01 per share core earnings variance, arising from the lower tax benefits on stock-based<br>compensation at the holding company, partially offset by improved results of $0.02 per share at our competitive businesses.<br>
As I noted earlier, SCE and EIX results in the fourth quarter were impacted by 2 significant noncore items, the revised SONGS settlement and tax<br>reform.<br>
SCE had $1.48 per share of noncore charges in the fourth quarter. This relates to a $448 million after-tax charge or $1.38 per share associated with<br>the revised SONGS settlement and a $33 million charge or $0.10 per share related to tax reform.<br>
EIX parent and other had $1.29 per share of noncore charges in the fourth quarter, largely related to tax reform. Specifically, the remeasurement<br>of deferred taxes resulted in a $433 million expense or $1.33 per share. We will continue to utilize our net operating losses and credits, and based<br>on our current analysis, EIX expects to become a cash taxpayer in 2025.<br>
Please turn to Page 3. Overall, for the full year, Edison International core earnings increased $0.53 per share over prior year. This includes $0.44 per<br>share of increased revenue related to the attrition mechanism in SCE's 2015 General Rate Case.<br>
Many of the earnings drivers for full year 2017 are similar to the quarter, so I will only highlight 2 items. At SCE, lower operation and maintenance<br>costs contributed $0.07 per share to overall performance over the prior year. Also, as we have communicated in previous quarters, EIX parent and<br>other realized significant tax benefits in 2017 and the $0.17 per share increase in core earnings over the prior year is largely a result of these.<br>
For the year ended 2017, we have not recorded liability associated with the December wildfires. Given the preliminary stages of the investigations<br>and the uncertainty as to the causes and potential damages associated with the fires, we cannot determine that a liability is probable or a reasonable<br>range of possible losses that could be incurred. We will continue to update you as we have more information.<br>

<A name=289></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, EIX - Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call<br>
Overall, core earnings of $4.50 per share are $0.18 per share higher than the midpoint of guidance. SCE earnings are $0.15 per share higher due<br>primarily to increased O&amp;M savings and financing benefits and higher income tax benefits.<br>
Edison International parent and other losses of $0.08 per share are $0.03 per share better than guidance, largely from better operating cost<br>performance at the holding company and our competitive businesses.<br>
Please turn to Page 4. While we continue to wait for a decision on SCE's 2018 General Rate Case, SCE has developed and is executing against a 2018<br>capital expenditure plan that will allow SCE to ramp up its capital spending program over the 3-year GRC period, that is 2018 through 2020, to<br>meet what is ultimately authorized in the decision while minimizing the associated risk of unauthorized spending.<br>
As part of this, we will focus initial grid mark spending on capital that provides safety and reliability benefits while deferring most spending is<br>primarily focused on integration of distributed energy resources.<br>
While we continue to present our 2019 and 2020 capital forecast at our current GRC request level, we adjusted CPUC capital expenditures in 2018<br>to $3.6 billion to reflect our latest planning for the year.<br>
Additionally, we made updates throughout the forecast period for changes in FERC projects. Our total 2018 CPUC and FERC capital expenditure<br>plan is $4.2 billion.<br>
While we wait for the outcome related to the 2018 GRC, over the long term, we continue to see SCE investing at least $4 billion per year and adding<br>at least $2 billion per year of rate base for the foreseeable future as SCE focuses on investments in the grid and continues to be a key enabler of<br>California's ambitious climate change policy.<br>
Page 5 of the deck provides our rate base forecast. The CPUC rate base forecast is based on the weighted average rate base that we requested in<br>the GRC for the forward looking 3-year period. That is it reflects our 2018 through 2020 request level capital expenditure.<br>
Once SCE receives a final decision in the 2018 GRC, our rate base forecast will be updated to reflect the authorized levels.<br>
At that time, we will also update our capital expenditures for 2019 and 2020. We have, however, updated our rate case forecast to reflect the impact<br>to tax reform, changes in the latest FERC capital forecast and additional incentive CWIP treatment with certain FERC projects.<br>
Please turn to Slide 6 where we provide our current rate base forecast along with the impact of changes since our November update.<br>
As you can see, tax reform has little impact on our 2018 rate base. But by 2020, it increases our rate base by $400 million. This increase is mainly<br>related to the elimination of bonus depreciation.<br>
During the fourth quarter of 2017, FERC approved incentive CWIP treatment for 3 additional transmission projects, Alberhill, Mesa and<br>Eldorado-Lugo-Mohave. This incentive treatment means that we can add capital expenditures related to those projects to rate base in the year<br>they are spent rather than waiting for the project to be placed in service.<br>
As a result, rate base is approximately $500 million higher by 2020. However, this increase is offset by reduced capital spending as a result of<br>improved cost efficiencies and revisions of projects, scope and schedule related to our FERC capital projects and program.<br>
Cost efficiencies and reduced scope account for approximately 1/3 of the change in capital spending. The remaining 2/3 represents a timing shift<br>that will be added to rate base outside the forecast window. The majority of these changes are captured in the major transmission project update<br>on Slide 7.<br>
On the subject of FERC, I would also like to provide a brief update on our current FERC formula rate proceeding. A key matter in that proceeding<br>is the determination of our authorized ROE. In December 2017, the FERC ruled that the requested formula rate would go into effect January 1, 2018,<br>

subject to refund. This means that while we are collecting our requested ROE for the FERC related revenues during 2018, these dollars will be<br>adjusted and refunded depending upon the final decision in our proceeding.<br>
Our ROE request is comprised of a base return on equity of 10.3%, plus the 50 basis point CAISO participation adder for a total ROE of 10.8% before<br>individual project incentives.<br>
The weighted average of individual project incentives increases the requested ROE to the equivalent of about 11.5% based on our current capital<br>expenditure plan.<br>
In this December ruling, FERC also approved the 50 basis point CAISO participation adder, although I should note that the CPUC has intervened in<br>our FERC rate proceeding and has requested an application for rehearing on the approval of this adder.<br>
The FERC also directed the parties to commence settlement discussions, and the parties are scheduled to reconvene at FERC on May 15. Hearings<br>will be held if the parties do not ultimately settle. We cannot speculate on the outcome of this proceeding or the time line, and we'll keep you<br>updated as new information is presented.<br>
Please turn to Page 8. As I noted on our third quarter earnings call, we will not be providing 2018 earnings guidance until we receive a final decision<br>on the General Rate Case. However, we have laid out a few key items on this page that you should consider as you model 2018 and beyond.<br>
I've already discussed the majority of information on this page. However, please note under other items, we list some key considerations outside<br>the simplified rate base model.<br>
First, as Pedro touched on briefly in his comments, the market for wildfire insurance for California IOUs is becoming more strained. Availability is<br>declining while simultaneously premiums are going up.<br>
In late December, we notified the commission that SCE secured $300 million of wildfire insurance for the 2018 calendar year and requested the<br>commission approve recovery of the associated premiums of approximately $121 million.<br>
Although we believe we have a strong case for recovery, until the CPUC addresses our request, you should assume an additional $0.29 per share<br>drag on earnings in 2018.<br>
There may also be additional insurance costs that are in excess of what we have requested in our GRC. We do not yet have information regarding<br>the overall costs, however.<br>
Second, while we are not providing guidance for SCE, we do expect EIX parent and others to be an earnings drag of $0.25 to $0.30 per share for<br>2018. The increase in EIX parent and other is related to a lower tax shield as a result of the lower corporate tax rate and higher interest expense.<br>Also included is the EPS of Edison Energy, which is expected to improve in 2018 over prior year results as we continue to work towards our goal of<br>a run rate breakeven level of earnings by year-end 2019.<br>
Finally, we have not included any tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which was a significant factor in 2017 performance.<br>
Please turn to Page 9. On February 16, we filed updated testimony on our GRC proceeding to include the impacts of tax reform legislation on our<br>CPUC jurisdictional revenue requirement. We are now requesting a 2018 revenue requirement of $5.534 billion, a $106 million decrease from the<br>2017 revenue requirement.<br>
Posttest year revenue requirements have also decreased from our prior request.<br>
Overall, we estimate this latest update will result in approximately 3% CAGR in total rate between 2017 and 2020. We will remain focused on ways<br>to mitigate customer rate impacts while continuing to invest in our electric grid infrastructure.<br>

<A name=291></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, EIX - Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call<br>
EIX and SCE continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility. At EIX, we issued a $500 million 1 year term loan in<br>January to partially pay down our commercial paper program. At SCE, our average common equity component of total capitalization was 50% as<br>of December 31, including the charge from the revised SONGS settlement.<br>
If approved by the CPUC, the revised settlement allows SCE to exclude the $448 million after-tax charge from its equity capitalization ratio.<br>
As we have already discussed, tax reform results in a lower revenue requirement and lower customer rates, although rate base will increase as a<br>result of the elimination of bonus depreciation.<br>
Considering these items and given the potential for a large capital program based on our GRC request as well as other potential investments in<br>support of the state's clean energy objectives, we will likely see increased financing needs in the future as higher capital spending is followed by<br>related growth in authorized rate base and earnings.<br>
We will continually assess the most cost effective approach to financing and could consider optimizing the use of short and long-term debt at<br>either EIX or SCE.<br>
We are pleased that we are able to benefit from the prudently conservative balance sheets we have maintained at both SCE and the holding<br>company as we continue to invest in SCE.<br>
That concludes my remarks. Ash, please open the call for questions.<br>

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.<br>
<b>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director and Head of the US Power, Utilities, &amp; Alternative Energy Equity<br>Research<br>
I wanted to first follow up on the change in the parent drag. How are you thinking about mitigating this over time? I know you just are talking<br>about kind of preliminary '18 guidance here and we're already asking you how you think about it into the future. But obviously, it's a pretty<br>meaningful move. Can you give us any thoughts on the breakdown of what exactly is in that approximately quarter of drag and how that evolves?<br>
<b>Maria C. Rigatti</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Sure. So I think in the past, we've said a penny and a half per month. I think this looks more like $0.02 per month, plus whatever Edison Energy is<br>doing. Obviously, over time, the Edison Energy number is one that we are working towards a breakeven run rate by the end of 2019, so that will<br>be part of the approach to minimize that drag. And at the holding company, tax reform has had an impact on us. While we believe that from a<br>deductibility perspective, we'll be able to allocate that expense, the fact that we just had less of a tax shield as a result of the lower tax rate is having<br>an impact.<br>
We always look at operating cost efficiencies from the conversation we just had, or the remarks that we just made that we actually benefit a little<br>bit in the fourth quarter at the holding company from lower costs. That will be our approach, the same one we've used at the balance of the<br>company.<br>

<b>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director and Head of the US Power, Utilities, &amp; Alternative Energy Equity<br>Research<br>
Excellent. And I wanted to follow up on the dividend. Just in terms of the comfort level that the board obviously had in declaring the latest dividend,<br>how do you think about that evolving as you learn more about the potential exposures here? Maybe said differently, with respect to the discrete<br>test that you had to evaluate the latest dividend, how do you think about potential risks of reevaluating that in subsequent quarters here?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Julien, I'll take that. This is Pedro. I think like I said in my remarks, our board looked at a broad range of potential negative outcomes here. I know<br>that we're not putting out a specific estimates that we may have or the like, and I also recognize that a number of analysts have put out their own<br>sets of ranges out there. But suffice it to say, we took a look at a good broad range of potential outcomes here based on the information we have<br>at hand and the board felt we're very comfortable making this quarterly dividend decision.<br>
In the normal course, we always update you on dividend actions. We typically have talked about potential adjustments in annual dividend levels<br>at the end of the year, but then we validate as a board and do actual board approval quarter-by-quarter. And that's again our normal course, and<br>that remains our normal course. So a quarter from now, we'll be having the next discussion on that quarterly dividend.<br>
Again, we did look at a broad range of potential outcomes here, so there would have to be some very new information that the changes that range<br>of outcomes to affect the thinking further. I think that's about the best way that I can frame it at this point, Julian. Does that help?<br>
<b>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director and Head of the US Power, Utilities, &amp; Alternative Energy Equity<br>Research<br>
Yes, absolutely. So you included the mudslides and the totality of the events that have occurred as best you understand it?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I've stayed purposefully vague here, but we did say that we looked at -- we did look at the potential impacts from all these things that happened.<br>We're not commenting on causation and the like, but the board did take a look at that potential range of impacts from all these various events.<br>
So I think we've taken a very diligent approach as directors at looking at a lot of ways in which under California regulations and law that could<br>impact the company and felt very comfortable about the rigor behind the broad look that we took.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley.<br>
<b>Stephen Calder Byrd</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Head of North American Research for the Power and Utilities and Clean Energy<br>
I wanted to talk about fire insurance. And I think you talked a bit about this in your prepared remarks. But just generally, as you think about the<br>cost and availability of fire insurance, I guess, really both for you, but more broadly for your customers and for others in the region, we hear some<br>concerns about areas becoming uninsurable or costs rising significantly. How do you see that evolving in California? And I guess relatedly, do you<br>see a political awareness in the legislative body in terms of the need to be thinking about this holistically?<br>

<A name=293></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, EIX - Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
This is Pedro. And I'll start this one and Maria or others may want to comment from the management team.<br>
First of all, you have to date up this insurance forms that we purchased, as Maria described in her comments. I think it's safe to say that's probably<br>the most expensive premium we've paid for insurance ever. So that alone is a data point on -- there was availability, but at a much steeper cost<br>than we've seen before. And as we continue to head into the market to secure different elements, different tranches of our towers, we are continuing<br>to see a very tight market.<br>
But to your point on awareness, that's frankly part of our job right now, to make sure that we are making policymakers aware and we're fully<br>engaged on that. I mentioned in my remarks that we are engaged with the entire community of policymakers out there, from the governor's office,<br>through to key legislators. We are doing a lot of that jointly with other utilities or other groups that are I think aware of the issues here across the<br>state. And again, it's part of not just a utility issue, it's part of a statewide issue here that we think the severity and the frequency of these fires<br>continues to go the way it's gone over the last 3 years. It's going to continue to put added pressure on the insurance market and other parts of the<br>economy. So we've taken it on ourselves to make sure that we are knocking on a whole lot of doors in Sacramento right now, making sure folks<br>are aware and bringing some of our ideas to the table of what reforms might be needed to solve this statewide issue.<br>
Maria or Adam, anyone from General Counsel, anything you want to add?<br>
<b>Maria C. Rigatti</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
I'd just say I think it's something that the regulators really need to pay attention to. When we filed our GRC, people were very appreciative of the<br>$85 million in O&amp;M costs that we had taken out of the system and this sort of insurance premium completely swamps that. And it does get recovered<br>in our General Rate Cases, we applied for that, so customers will ultimately bear very high costs unless and until we can make people aware of the<br>issue.<br>
<b>Stephen Calder Byrd</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Head of North American Research for the Power and Utilities and Clean Energy<br>
Okay. Just maybe one follow-up on physically as we think about your utility system. Is there a lot of co-location telecom equipment with your<br>equipment? Or how do you broadly think about the degree to which there is that co-location of there of telecom equipment with yours?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I don't know that we have a fact or figure handy right now, but I'll turn it over to Kevin Payne. Short answer is there is certainly some level of<br>co-location across the system. Kevin, anything you would add?<br>
<b>Kevin M. Payne</b> - Southern California Edison Company - CEO and Director<br>
Yes. We've looked at the high fire areas in particular and usually about 70% of our facilities are -- have co-location with other utilities. Is there<br>something specific about that you're interested in or...<br>
<b>Stephen Calder Byrd</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Head of North American Research for the Power and Utilities and Clean Energy<br>
No, that's really -- all I wanted to understand was the scope.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
The next question comes from Christopher Turnure, J.P. Morgan.<br>
<b>Christopher James Turnure</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst<br>
I wanted to make sure I had a clear understanding of the role of various agencies in the Thomas fire investigation. Is Cal Fire definitely the lead<br>agency there? Are there any local fire departments involved? And is there any investigations pertaining directly to the mudslides that would be<br>separate from that, that you're aware of?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Let me pass it over to Adam Umanoff, our General Counsel, Christopher.<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
Christopher, you're correct. Cal Fire is the lead fire investigation agency as they typically are in fires where they're actively involved in suppression.<br>Separate from Cal Fire, we understand that the Ventura County Fire Department is conducting some level of investigation.<br>
In addition, the safety and enforcement division of the California Public Utility Commission will be conducting an investigation. Those are the<br>investigations that we know are ongoing.<br>
<b>Christopher James Turnure</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Okay. And how we should think about cooperation and timing with the Ventura Fire Department along with Cal Fire for any kind of ultimate<br>conclusion on cause here?<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
I wish we could give you some comfort on timing. We wish we had more comfort on timing, we don't. These investigations historically have taken<br>anywhere between 12 and 18 months to complete. And I think we have to stick with that as a suggested time frame, but there's really no certainty<br>with regard to the time element of these investigations.<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Adam, these investigations are very much case-by-case based on the facts that investigators pursue.<br>

<b>Christopher James Turnure</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Okay. And then in terms of your legal strategy out of the gate here in the court system, is there anything that you can tell us in this early stage that<br>might make your strategy differ from some of your peers or differ from that engaged by PG&amp;E in the Butte fire last year? I realize it's obviously still<br>early there and you're probably limited in what you can say, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts.<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
Well, you're correct. It's very, very early. The investigation around cause has just commenced, so I think it really is premature to speculate as to what<br>the ultimate strategy will be. You will see, as we've seen in other large fires like this, an effort to coordinate before a single judge, the numerous<br>lawsuits that are brought. And in fact, there is a motion to coordinate the various lawsuits that have currently been brought in the Thomas fire.<br>That's a procedural step to hopefully make the litigation more efficient, but that's really at the early stages as well. So not much more we can tell<br>at this point.<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Adam, maybe I would add and I totally agree with how you framed it and these things are really case-by-case, depending on the facts in any given<br>case. If you move up, though, to the 10,000-foot level, I think you're seeing indications that from a policy perspective, not from an individual, legal<br>strategy from an individual case, but from a policy perspective, there's a lot of good discussion and coordination with our other peer utilities in the<br>state. And you've seen, as I mentioned in my comments, we joined with PG&amp;E in filing the application for the hearing in the San Diego WEMA case.<br>We filed an amicus in the PG&amp;E Butte case. So I think there's a recognition that the broader themes around policy and moving beyond just inverse<br>condemnation, that support for a number of actions across the economy, across fire prevention and hardening infrastructure and costs and risk<br>allocation, those are ones where at that 10,000-foot level it's so important that we be aligned, and we are.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Praful Mehta, Citigroup.<br>
<b>Praful Mehta</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director<br>
Pedro, you made a point on the call to mention that all this fix around inverse condemnation is going to take some time. Just wanted to get a little<br>bit more color on that, both from the legislative and legal side. What kind of timing are you thinking about in terms of solving inverse condemnation<br>right now?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, again, this is one where, I think, we can give you a sense of that will take time, but it's very hard to pin down, here's the calendar or here's<br>facing high ends at this very early stage. But let's take it in pieces. There are legal strategies, and so those play themselves out in individual cases.<br>And I mentioned the Butte case with PG&amp;E or the Round fire case where we made our filing, right? So there's a track around each of those cases.<br>There's a PUC regulatory track, right? And I don't think that we have a clarity yet in terms of the timing for the PUC to consider the various applications<br>for rehearing in that San Diego WEMA case or the PG&amp;E WEMA case activity there. So typical and I'm looking around at Ron Nichols here, but typical<br>CPUC time lines, certainly, it can be in the many months to a couple of years sort of time frame.<br>
Then finally, to the extent that legislative policy changes attract something that we're also looking at, that happens in cycles of legislative sessions.<br>And so we have a session that runs through later this year. It's a possibility of next year's session. So we -- I will tell you we are certainly advocating<br>about the sense of urgency on this, and we would love to see traction in this legislative session on some of these key pieces, but it's still early days<br>and that's not guaranteed. As I mentioned in my comments, the deadline for bills has passed, but you can still get changes in those vehicles. So<br>

there's always a possibility that as we continue to engage with legislators, we could see changes in the vehicles that are available already and bills<br>that have been filed.<br>
So that could be a this year thing or it might take longer to help build the momentum and build the case and it could extend into the next legislative<br>session.<br>
So I'm sorry, I think I took a lot of airtime there to say it's too early to tell. But hopefully, it gives you some color around some of the other pathways.<br>
<b>Praful Mehta</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director<br>
Yes. No, that's super helpful color. So I appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up on the legislative side. Is Senate Bill 819 still the right starting<br>point? Is that what you're working towards in terms of improving or changing or tweaking? Or is there a completely different bill? What's the<br>approach on the legislative side, I guess?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Ron, do you want to?<br>
<b>Ronald Owen Nichols</b> - Edison International - President of Southern California Edison<br>
There are a number of bills out there. So there really isn't any one specific bill that's been selected at this point that might be modified. There's<br>vehicles there that can be addressed over time as the session goes on.<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
And I think it's fair to say that, in general, the bills are addressing very specific issues. You're seeing, for example, a number of bills around dealing<br>with residential insurance benefits and extending provisions for them and whatnot. What we are advocating for as you can tell from our comments<br>here is a set of a more comprehensive solutions that deal with this statewide problem across all the different elements. Now that degree of difficulty<br>then becomes harder because so you're looking for more comprehensive pieces of action. And that's why I'm saying it's so early days.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Thank you for the comments on this Round fire case on inverse condemnation, I read that earlier in the week. I was curious if you have any sense<br>of where that is in its process. I know you filed the brief, but are you -- is there a date on which the court is set to hear it or anything like that?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
That's a great question for a lawyer. Adam?<br>

<A name=297></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, EIX - Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
Jonathan, it's Adam. The motion -- the court has set the hearing date to hear our motion for April 2. And that date can slip. It's always subject to<br>change.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And is -- then you could see either a ruling or more process after that date, just we're made -- wait to be seen around April 2, is that the right<br>way to think about that?<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
I think that's right. A lot depends on what the trial court does. If the trial court denies the motion, there's always the opportunity for us to appeal.<br>These issues may very well require appellate court review, not be settled at the trial court level. And that would take some significant additional<br>time.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Am I correct that in this particular case, the stage it's at, people have just asked for inverse condemnation to be applied to the utility, but the court<br>has yet to rule on whether that should be allowed?<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
Yes, that's a good way -- Jonathan, that's a good way to describe it. In most of these cases, the plaintiffs alleged that the standard of care that we<br>have to comply with is strict liability arising from the application of inverse condemnation. They simply plead it. And we have to defend that, or in<br>this case, we challenge it.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
So in the Butte fire case, the PG&amp;E is trying to overturn a finding. And in your case, you're trying to sort of prevent one, effectively.<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
I can't speak to the procedural status of the Butte case. I don't believe that there's been a final determination. I know they are challenging the<br>application of inverse condemnation.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Yes. So I guess my question was in this case has it also been applied or is it yet to be applied, I just wanted to be sure on that.<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
It has not yet been applied in the Round fire case.<br>

<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Great. And then just, Maria, towards the end of your comments, you were talking about higher financing needs and how you could look at some<br>holdco debt or incremental debt at the utilities. You didn't specifically mention equity, and obviously, equity hasn't been part of the story of EIX,<br>certainly since I've been involved in covering the company. But it seems like you might have been at least floating that possibility, even though<br>you didn't name it. Am I hearing that right or...<br>
<b>Maria C. Rigatti</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Jonathan, I think what I was really trying to say was that we have had a number of things that's affected other companies as well in terms of tax<br>reform and the like. And we've also had some cash flow impacts from assuming the SONGS settlement is approved, we have some cash flow impacts<br>there as well. And we are waiting for our rate case to come, and we have a number of other proceedings where we're also requesting capital. So<br>there's a lot out there, and we're going to stay flexible in terms of how we finance that, either at EIX or SCE, either with short-term debt or long-term<br>debt. I think that's really all I was really trying to say right now.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And then just to bring it up there. In the SONGS settlement, you've asked for this adjustment of the calculation of the equity ratio. Is the<br>settlement contingent on the commission approving that aspect of it? Or what would happen if they decided there wasn't a case made for that<br>particular element?<br>
<b>Maria C. Rigatti</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Well, certainly, the settlement on -- all of the parties have agreed to support all of the elements of the settlement. The CPUC is going through their<br>process. At this point, I think it's too early to really speculate on that.<br>
<b>Ronald Owen Nichols</b> - Edison International - President of Southern California Edison<br>
This is Ron. I just would add to that, that the settlement provides for any material modification to it has to be agreed to by the parties.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. So it might be hard for the commission to modify that or not, we'll have to see.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust.<br>
<b>Ali Agha</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Maria, you had mentioned that the equity ratio at SCE was 50% at the end of the year. Can you remind us what that means in dollar terms in terms<br>of the excess equity cushion you currently have there?<br>
<b>Maria C. Rigatti</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
So it's a 13-month average that we have to maintain at 48%. I am going to say round number, it's about...<br>

<A name=299></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, EIX - Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call<br>
<b>Unidentified Company Representative</b><br>
It's more than $500 million.<br>
<b>Maria C. Rigatti</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
It's more than $500 million. I think it's around $600 million. Sorry, I was just looking at some of the math here as we answer your question, Ali. It's<br>around there. It's a little bit -- you can't tie it down to any particular number like consistently just because it's a 13-month average rolling calculation<br>that we do. So it's in that ballpark.<br>
<b>Ali Agha</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
I see. Okay. And then, Pedro, as you mentioned, there are -- you have various forums and parts you're looking at trying to get some clarity closure,<br>if you will, on inverse condemnation, et cetera. Is your sense that for full clarity to come, you need the Cal Fire investigation to first be complete,<br>in their determination on causes? Is that sort of the critical part item? Or from the outside, how should we be looking at and keeping track of -- to<br>say, okay, this is a key element in some clarity on this process?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. That's a good question. And I think my answer is<br>
[Audio gap]<br>
I was thinking about pieces, separate tracks, right? So there's a track around the Cal Fire investigation, to the Thomas fire and causation per se and<br>then what standards will be applied in terms of liability and all of that. There's this broader track around -- the state has an issue. It's a big issue.<br>Part of the issue is this -- the concern about the application of inverse condemnation feasibility, so the issue is broader than that, as I mentioned<br>earlier. And so we're really looking for a broader, statewide solution.<br>
Now clearly, there's a connection between these, right? And so if we had a very speedy resolution, and I think that would be wishing for a lot<br>because we do expect this will take time. But let's say that we have clarity up front in terms of there's a bill that gets passed next month that resolves<br>the application of inverse, well then it clearly would have some impact on -- once the Cal Fire investigation concludes, that would have impact on<br>the recourse it means we would have to get recoveries for damages.<br>
But again, I don't think that there's a serial linkage where we have to wait for that Cal Fire investigation of the Thomas fire to conclude in order to<br>work the various other paths, regulatory, legislative paths to try and resolve the broader statewide issue. I do see this as fairly decoupled. Does that<br>make sense, Ali?<br>
<b>Ali Agha</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
It does. To just on that to clarify your opening remarks as well, you talked about the California state goals, et cetera. Are you getting any conversations<br>back to suggest that there is some recognition coming that, hey, to meet our ambitious climate change and other goals, this issue is directly linked<br>and impacting that?<br>

<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Without getting into specifics who said what, yes, I think there is that recognition. And a lot of it is driven by the goals and the math behind the<br>goals. Let's just focus on the 40% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030. That goal alone, the state itself has looked at tools like electrification of<br>transportation, and building efficiency and renewables, requiring a strong grid, being a part of the solution, a major part of the solution. I'm glad<br>that we have completed our analysis that lead to our clean energy white paper in the fall because of that, quite frankly, sharpened our thinking in<br>terms of what it will take for the states to get there. And so that said, with the state, if the state really wants to get us a 40% reduction and deliver<br>the lowest possible cost for our customers, this is a whole lot of years from the smart, modern reliable grid that's needed to get 80% carbon-free<br>resources and get 7 million electric vehicles and get a bunch of water heaters and space heaters that are electric and so on. And so I think folks<br>recognize that, but it is helpful that we have voices like the Air Resources board who put out their plans. You have the governor upping state's<br>objective to 5 million electric vehicles. We still stand by our math, which suggests that it's a cheaper path for the state. It's actually more like 7<br>million electric vehicles. And I think, Ali, we'll see that continue to surface in various venues. One that I will point to coming up here is the integrated<br>resource planning process at the CPUC, which will use different scenarios and take a look at our long-term horizon for the resource mix in California.<br>And that I think will, once again, provide more proof points for the importance of healthy utilities.<br>

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the First Solar's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the<br>Investors section of the First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.<br>
I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore, First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin.<br>
<b>Stephen Haymore</b><br>
Thank you, Ashley. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its fourth<br>quarter and full year 2017 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on the Investors section of First<br>Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com.<br>
With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and<br>technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance for 2018. We will then open the call<br>up for questions.<br>
Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In the few cases<br>where we report non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income or non-GAAP EPS, we have<br>reconciled the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures at the back of our presentation.<br>
Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially<br>from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation<br>for a more complete description.<br>
It's now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark?<br>

<A name=303></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, FSLR - Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin today by briefly discussing some of our 2017 key accomplishments<br>which are highlighted on Slide 4.<br>
In a year that began with a great deal of uncertainty, with anticipated industry excess capacity leading to bearish module ASP projections coupled<br>with the challenges that came with our Series 6 transition, I am pleased with our focus, execution and ability to exceed our earnings and cash flow<br>commitments for the year.<br>
2017 was a record year with net bookings of 7.7 gigawatts DC with Series 6 representing 2.6 gigawatts DC of the bookings. Contracting this business<br>is an outstanding accomplishment and provides improved clarity to ramp and grow our Series 6 production over the coming years. In addition to<br>strong bookings in the U.S., we saw strength in international markets led by Australia, Japan, India and Europe, where we booked over 1.7 gigawatts.<br>
While strong demand in China and the 201 trade case in the U.S. helped to firm up the macro environment, our collaborative approach to working<br>with customers and the progress we've made towards the launch of our Series 6 module were key contributors to achieving these record bookings.<br>
O&amp;M bookings were also strong last year as we added nearly 2.9 gigawatts of projects, bringing our total O&amp;M fleet under contract to 8.5 gigawatts.<br>Notably, nearly 2/3 of the megawatts booked were in projects where we were not the developer. Successfully winning O&amp;M on projects not<br>developed by First Solar opens our addressable market, which helps create scale for O&amp;M business and thereby enhances our competitive position.<br>Our O&amp;M fleet continues to perform at the highest level with effective availability of 99.6% in 2017.<br>
There were also a number of notable achievements in our technology, manufacturing and EPC operations last year. Specific to our Series 6 product,<br>as we highlighted at our Analyst Day, we manufactured our first complete module at our factory in Ohio late last year. This target was reached<br>ahead of schedule and represents tremendous achievement by our entire technology and manufacturing teams.<br>
While focused on the development of our Series 6 product, improvement to our Series 4 product continued to roll through our production fleet<br>last year. Our full year 2017 Series 4 fleet average efficiency increased 50 basis points to 16.9% as compared to 2016. The increase in efficiency,<br>coupled with reductions in material and labor cost, enabled us to improve the cost per watt of our Series 4 modules by 14% from the prior year.<br>Note this is significantly better than our 9% reduction targeted for the year.<br>
Recently, we achieved a significant manufacturing milestone as we produced our 200 millionth module since the inception of the company. This<br>accomplishment is attributed to the dedication and commitment of our manufacturing associates worldwide. We've had tremendous learnings<br>along this high-value manufacturing journey which has resulted in one of the most differentiated technologies in the industry. Since 2008, we've<br>seen a greater than 40% improvement in line throughput, a more than 50% increase in module efficiency and a reduction of cost per watt of over<br>70%. These results are truly remarkable.<br>
In addition, we continue to make excellent progress on driving down the balance of system cost. Relative to our expectation at the beginning of<br>2017, we have lowered the projected balance of system cost per watt by 20% on major projects that we will be constructing in 2018. This improvement<br>is a result of lower labor cost from utilizing Series 6 modules as well as taking a comprehensive value stream approach to driving down all aspects<br>of BoS cost.<br>
With over 7.5 gigawatts of cumulative modules installed, the extensive experience of our EPC team provides not only tremendous benefit to our<br>captive project pipeline but is also a key component of the power plant solutions we offer to corporate and utility customers. As a result of the<br>strong Series 4 bookings, the cost per watt improvements made and by executing on our key system project sales, we achieved 2017 earnings<br>adjusted for the onetime impact of tax reform and restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2.59 per share, which is in the high end of our<br>guidance range. With over $1.3 billion in operating cash flow generated and an ending net cash balance of $2.6 billion, we further enhanced our<br>industry best balance sheet.<br>
In late 2016, when we announced the acceleration of our Series 6 road map, one of our key objectives was to ensure sufficient liquidity throughout<br>this process. Thus far, we are tracking extremely well against this objective as measured by our net cash at the end of 2017. The net cash position<br>

<A name=304></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, FSLR - Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call<br>
is even more significant when taking into account the fact that in 2017, we invested roughly $500 million in Series 6 capacity, representing<br>approximately 35% of the total committed CapEx, which includes capital for our second factory in Vietnam that was not in our original road map,<br>but we still have a significant capital investment ahead. We are in a strong financial position to execute on the road map.<br>
Turning to Slide 5. I'll take the next step to provide an update on our Series 6 manufacturing plans. Beginning with our factory in Ohio, we have<br>continued to make good progress since the last update -- since we last updated you at our Analyst Day. Our Ohio Series 6 line is now fully integrated,<br>and manufacturing modules for extensive testing and evaluation is ongoing. The line performance thus far is consistent with our expectations for<br>this stage as a startup, and our next major milestone is the start of high-value manufacturing which is scheduled to begin in the second quarter.<br>
In Malaysia, where our first equipment began arriving last October, we now have over 90% of the front-end tools installed. And we are targeting<br>the first complete module at this location in Q2. In Vietnam, the first factory is ready for tool installation and we have reached a key milestone in<br>January when the coater arrived on site. Construction activities at the second Vietnam factory are ahead of schedule, and hiring for the factories<br>is progressing.<br>
Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we are making across these 3 subsequent Series 6 factories with construction activities, factory<br>readiness, tool delivery and tool install all advancing according to plan. Primary focus continues to be on maximizing the Series 6 capacity. However,<br>as a result of strong Series 4 bookings, we have decided to restart 2 lines of Series 4 production in Ohio, which were shut down in late 2017.<br>
With our prior work force having transitioned to support the new Series 6 process, we are currently hiring new associates to run these lines. These<br>additional lines will provide us with 180 megawatts of additional volume in 2018. Whether we continue to run these lines beyond 2018 will depend<br>on market conditions. This incremental capacity raises our 2018 expected production to 3.1 gigawatts DC.<br>
Next I'll discuss our bookings since our last earnings call. As highlighted on Slide 6, we had net 2017 bookings of 7.7 gigawatts DC versus shipments<br>of 2.7 gigawatts DC for the same period. Since the start of 2018, we have booked approximately 1.3 gigawatts of additional volume, bringing our<br>total future contracted business to 9.1 gigawatts DC. Including the 1.3 gigawatts of volume booked year-to-date, our total bookings since our Q3<br>earnings call are now over 2.3 gigawatts DC.<br>
Development project bookings are a key component of the 2.3 gigawatts of new business signed. Leveraging our advantaged Series 6 module,<br>we have signed PPAs for nearly 600 megawatts DC with both utility and corporate customers. As discussed at our recent Analyst Day, demand for<br>solar power from both utility and corporate customers is expected to grow significantly in coming years. We believe that we are well positioned<br>to take advantage of this opportunity and be a partner of choice for these customers.<br>
Focusing first on utility customers, we signed a PPA with Georgia Power for a 200-megawatt AC project that is expected to commence construction<br>in November 2018 and reach COD by late 2019. We were awarded this volume as part of the 525 megawatt AC RFP for Georgia Power's renewable<br>energy development initiative. Upon completion, it will be one of the largest solar power plants in the southeastern U.S. We look forward to<br>continuing our partnership with Georgia Power in helping them meet -- fulfill the needs of their customers.<br>
Additionally, we have signed a PPA with APS to develop and construct the 65 megawatt AC solar power plant in Arizona with a 50 megawatt AC<br>battery capable of delivering power for more than 3 hours. This project is expected to be one of the largest PV-plus-storage or PVS systems in the<br>U.S. when completed in 2020. We believe this PVS project is an industry first, demonstrating the ability of the combined technology to serve APS<br>with a firm peaking resource, which will allow APS to meet customers' electricity demands into the evening hours. We're excited for the opportunity<br>to partner with APS on this flagship project to provide reliable, cost-effective, dispatchable solar and thereby enhancing the economic value of<br>solar energy.<br>
In addition to utilities contracting First Solar via PPAs, we're also witnessing growing interest and increased approval for utility ownership for solar<br>generation as highlighted by our recent partnership with Tampa Electric Company. As indicated previously, we signed a large module agreement<br>with Tampa Electric Company last year and we have now contracted with them to add EPC scope to 3 projects which total 250 megawatts DC.<br>We're excited about the opportunity to help them build out their fleet of rate base utility scale solar, and we continue to discuss with them additional<br>projects where we may add EPC services to our current module supply agreement.<br>

<A name=305></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, FSLR - Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call<br>
As a long-term owner of solar assets, utility buyers place greater emphasis on partnering with exceptional performance track record, a reputation<br>for quality and a strong balance sheet. We believe we are well positioned in this market as our strengths closely match their requirements, and we<br>expect this trend toward utility ownership to continue to accelerate.<br>
Moving to C&amp;I. I would like to highlight our continued progress in this market segment. We signed 150 megawatt AC PPA with a major corporate<br>renewable customer in the U.S. This agreement represents a significant purchase of solar power that will enable this customer to advance towards<br>its 100% renewable energy goal. We will provide more detail on this transaction in the future.<br>
Similarly to utility customers, corporate renewable buyers are now focused on the -- not only focused on the economics and value of solar, but<br>also heavily weigh other factors they believe give us an advantage with this customer group. Corporate customers are very focused on avoiding<br>reputational risk, which means they are looking for partners with a proven track record and financial stability. In addition, they value partners with<br>a global reach and the ability to provide turnkey solutions.<br>
Internationally, our development pipeline in Australia continues to grow with the signing of the Beryl project located in New South Wales. This<br>project is expected to be completed in the middle of 2019 and brings our contracted pipeline to over 100 megawatts AC in Australia. We continue<br>to have a very active development portfolio in Australia with additional projects in our mid- to late-stage pipeline.<br>
Moving to Slide 7. I'll provide an update on our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities. At 6.8 gigawatts DC, the mid- to late-stage opportunities<br>are more than triple the opportunities we had this time last year. Since last quarter's earnings call, the number of opportunities have increased by<br>a net [800 megawatts DC] (corrected by company after the call). With bookings of over 2.3 gigawatts DC during the same time period, gross total<br>opportunities added exceeded 3 gigawatts. Included in the 6.8 gigawatts of opportunities are more than 1.5 gigawatts of projects that we have<br>signed, but due to our disciplined approach have not yet been counted as bookings. The majority of these opportunities are expected to book<br>over the course of the year as financing and other CPs are closed.<br>
Also of note is that our mid- to late-stage pipeline provides visibility into contracting volume for the next several years. Over 4.5 gigawatts of the<br>opportunities are for delivery in either 2020 or 2021, highlighting the time period in which we are discussing opportunities with our customers.<br>System projects are another important component of the mid- to late-stage opportunities and comprise over 750 megawatts DC of these potential<br>bookings.<br>
Similar to last quarter, this list includes opportunities with U.S. utilities, corporate customers and international projects in Japan and Australia. While<br>not reflected as a potential booking opportunity in the 6.8 gigawatts shown, we are currently in discussions with various customers that have<br>already purchased our modules to add EPC scope to nearly 900 megawatts DC of projects. These potential opportunities are in addition to the<br>more than 250 megawatts DC already booked with Tampa Electric Company. While these EPC agreements will not be counted as bookings when<br>signed, they will be added to our contracted future revenue and be reflected in the contracted pipeline table in our 10-K and 10-Q filings.<br>
With 900 megawatts of EPC opportunities, almost 600 megawatts of new project development bookings and 750 megawatts of mid- to late-stage<br>development opportunities, we are encouraged by our progress and remain steadfastly focused on strengthening our systems pipeline.<br>
Lastly, as recently announced, 8point3, our joint venture YieldCo with SunPower, has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Capital<br>Dynamics. This agreement follows a comprehensive, multi-phased process where more than 130 parties were contacted or expressed inbound<br>interest. And while multiple structures were considered, based on the extensive nature of this process, we firmly believe the transaction with Capital<br>Dynamics represents the most compelling option for all shareholders.<br>
With committed acquisition financing and Capital Dynamics' proven track record of acquiring renewable projects, we are confident this transaction<br>will close. We expect net proceeds from the sale of our interests in 8point3 of approximately $230 million. Please note that the actual net proceeds<br>upon -- we will receive upon closing will depend on the day when the transaction actually closes. Upon closing of the transaction, the $50 million<br>promissory note associated with our sale of interest in the Stateline Project to 8point3 will be repaid.<br>
I'll now turn the call over to Alex who will provide more detail on our fourth quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2018.<br>

<b>Alexander R. Bradley</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CFO<br>
Thanks, Mark. Turning to Slide 9. I'll begin by discussing our fourth quarter operational highlights, and keep in mind that the metrics provided are<br>reflective of Series 4 manufacturing only.<br>
Module production increased slightly in the fourth quarter to 532 megawatts DC, a 1% increase from Q3. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016,<br>production is lower as a result of ramping down certain Series 4 lines in Ohio and Malaysia to make way for Series 6 production. Capacity utilization,<br>which makes adjustments for the lines taken out of service, was 99%. Our fourth quarter fleet and best line conversion efficiency were unchanged<br>versus the prior quarter at 17%. This will be the last quarter we'll report Series 4 efficiency since we'll remain relatively unchanged going forward.<br>And in future quarters, as Series 6 enters production, we will modify the operational metrics to provide the most relevant information.<br>
I'll next discuss some of the income statement highlights of our fourth quarter on Slide 10. This will include some non-GAAP measures such as<br>adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. And please refer to the Appendix in<br>the earnings presentation for the accompanying GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.<br>
Net sales in the fourth quarter were $339 million, a decrease of $748 million compared to the prior quarter. The expected decrease in net sales was<br>due to both lower systems and third-party module sales. Systems project sales are much higher in Q3 due to the initial revenue recognition of the<br>California Flats and Cuyama projects. For the second phase of California Flats as well as other development projects scheduled to reach COD in<br>2018, which will optimize the Series 6 modules, there was minimal systems activity in Q4 of 2017. Projects such as Rosamond and Willow Springs,<br>which are scheduled to be completed in 2018, have not yet been sold and therefore do not have any revenue recognized in Q4. Both these projects<br>are progressing well through the sale process.<br>
For full year 2017 net sales were $2.94 billion, a 1% increase versus the prior year. Relative to our net sales guidance for '17, our actual sales are<br>slightly lower as a result of certain project sales in India that moved into 2018. As mentioned on our last earnings call, there was some uncertainty<br>as the timing of when these projects would be sold. While we did close the sale of the 35 megawatts in 2017, the remaining projects are now<br>expected to be sold this year.<br>
At a percentage of total quarterly net sales, our system revenue in Q4 was 39% as compared to 72% in Q3. For the full year 2017, 73% of net sales<br>from our systems business compared to 77% in 2016. As I indicated at our Analyst Day in December, we have modified over segment reporting in<br>order to better align with our internal analysis of the business and also to reflect the expected increase in third-party module sales as we ramp<br>manufacturing capacity in the coming years. The module segment now includes only module sales to third parties and the system segment will<br>include all revenue from the sale of solar power systems including the module. These changes offset in reporting will be fully reflected in our 10-K.<br>
Gross margin decreased to 18% in the fourth quarter from 27% in Q3 primarily as a result of the low gross profit projects realized. For the full year,<br>gross margin was 19%. Adjusted operating expenses, which exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges, were $99 million in the fourth<br>quarter, an increase of $15 million compared to Q3. More than half of the increase is due to higher production startup as Series 6 activities accelerated.<br>
For 2017, adjusted operating expenses were $334 million in line with our guidance. Combined SG&amp;A and R&amp;D expense decreased by 25% versus<br>2016 despite higher variable compensation in Q4 of '17, and this reduction of $95 million is a significant 1-year reduction and demonstrates the<br>positive impact of our focused restructuring efforts.<br>
Excluding restructuring and asset impairments, we had an adjusted operating loss of $37 million in the fourth quarter compared to an adjusted<br>operating profit of $208 million in the third quarter. The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily due to lower net sales and higher<br>production startup expenses. For full year 2017, our adjusted operating income was $215 million.<br>
Before discussing income tax expense for the fourth quarter, it's important to understand the impact of the U.S. tax reform legislation that was<br>signed into law in December 2017. The new tax law, amongst other changes, lowered the statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%,<br>imposing mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introduced new tax regime and changed our foreign earnings<br>that's subject to U.S. tax.<br>

<hr>
<A name=307></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, FSLR - Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call<br>
Given the scope of our operations across module manufacturing, project development, EPC and O&amp;M services, and the global reach of our business<br>operating across the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa, India and Asia Pacific, the impact of tax reform on First Solar is both complex and<br>varied. Strategically, we believe the impact of tax reform will be a net positive for First Solar. We may see some short-term impact to the U.S. project<br>development and financing markets as capital structures and sources adapt to the new tax regime.<br>
We continue to evaluate the impact of the new international tax structures on our international manufacturing and sales businesses, and we expect<br>the lower corporate tax rate and immediate expensing of qualified equipment to be beneficial to our existing U.S. manufacturing base as well as<br>importantly making the option of adding additional U.S. manufacturing capacity more attractive as we look to scale the module manufacturing<br>business.<br>
Specific to 2017 reported financials and 2018 guidance, due to the complexity and recent implementation of this tax reform, we continue to evaluate<br>its impact. The provisional amounts that we have recorded will require additional analysis and further interpretation and guidance from government<br>regulators. This means that we expect to continue revising our provisional estimates until we file our 2017 federal return later this year. Our 2018<br>guidance being provided today has also been updated to reflect our provisional view of the impact of tax reform. But in both cases, the final results<br>and financial impact to this tax reform may differ materially from our current estimates.<br>
In the fourth quarter, we recorded a provisional tax expense of $408 million, which included a $401.5 million charge on the accumulated earnings<br>of foreign subsidiaries and a net deferred tax expense of $6.6 million for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at a lower U.S.<br>corporate income tax rate of 21%. These items were offset by a tax benefit in the quarter, bringing the total expense for Q4 to $399 million.<br>
The cash impact to this tax reform is expected to be much lower than the P&amp;L impact. By utilizing existing tax credits, we estimate our cash payment<br>will be approximately $101 million and we plan to pay this amount over the full 8-year period allowed. As a result of the higher tax charge, lower<br>revenue and higher production startup expenses, our GAAP loss per share in the fourth quarter was $4.14 compared to GAAP earnings per share<br>of $1.95 in Q3. The full year 2017 GAAP loss per share was $1.59. After adjusting for tax reform impacts and the effect of restructuring and asset<br>impairment charges, our non-GAAP loss per share was $0.25 in Q4 and our full year 2017 non-GAAP EPS was $2.59. Our $2.59 non-GAAP EPS for<br>'17 was near the end of our -- the high end of our guidance range even without including the international projects mentioned earlier that moved<br>into 2018.<br>
I'll next turn to Slide 11 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash and marketable securities balance at<br>year-end was nearly $3 billion, an increase of $270 million from the prior quarter. Our net cash position increased by $220 million to nearly $2.6<br>billion. The increase in our cash balance is primarily related to cash received from projects sold in the prior quarter and third-party module sales.<br>The year-end net cash balance of $2.6 billion was higher than our guidance expectations of $2.3 billion as a result of lower development spending<br>on certain projects due to timing, higher advanced module payments, favorable timing of collecting project receipts and working capital changes<br>partially offset by slightly higher CapEx.<br>
Net working capital in Q4, which includes the change in noncurrent project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities, decreased by $457<br>million. The change was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable from module and systems collections including final payments on the<br>Switch and Cuyama projects.<br>
Total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $394 million, an increase of $50 million from the prior quarter. The increase resulted from issuing<br>project level debt to fund ongoing project construction in Japan and Australia. And as a reminder, essentially, all of our outstanding debt is<br>project-related and will come off the balance sheet when the projects are sold.<br>
We had strong cash flows from operations in Q4 at $434 million primarily as a result of payments from system projects. Operating cash flow in the<br>prior quarter was $581 million. For 2017 full year, cash flow from operations were $1.34 billion, which exceeded the high end of our guidance<br>expectations. And operating cash flows were stronger for the year as a result of the same items that positively impacted net cash. Capital expenditures<br>were $199 million in the fourth quarter compared to $98 million in the prior quarter as spending on Series 6 increased. For the full year, CapEx was<br>$514 million, vast majority of which was invested in Series 6 past expansion.<br>

<A name=308></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, FSLR - Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call<br>
Turning to Slide 12. I will review our updated full year 2018 guidance. Before discussing the guidance in detail, it's important to keep in mind the<br>expected distribution of earnings between the first and second half of the year. With Series 6 production planned to commence in the second<br>quarter and ramp significantly in the second half of the year, we've always anticipated that first half of 2018 would be the trough in our earnings<br>profile. Startup expense is weighted towards the first half of the year.<br>
The timing of project sales and systems revenue recognition further magnifies the first half versus second half difference. The second half of<br>California Flats as well as the Rosamond and Willow Springs projects, will utilize Series 6 modules, which pushes more revenue and profit recognition<br>into the second half of the year. The forecast of sale of projects in Japan is also expected to take place later in the year. Based on these circumstances,<br>we expect approximately 25% of full year earnings to be recognized in the first half of the year with Q2 expected to be stronger than Q1. Depending<br>on the timing of U.S., India project sales between Q1 and Q2, there is a potential for a loss in Q1.<br>
With that context, I'll now discuss updated guidance ranges. We are raising our net sales guidance for $150 million to a revised range of $2.45<br>billion to $2.65 billion. The increase in net sales is a result of both the timing of the India project sales that we now expect to close in 2018 as well<br>as the increase in Series 4 production in Ohio. Gross margin guidance (inaudible) down by 50 basis points to 21.5% to 22.5% resulting from the<br>updated mix in revenue. Operating expenses remain unchanged from our prior expectations.<br>
As a result of the higher revenue, we're increasing the midpoint of our operating income guidance by $15 million. There are certain updates below<br>operating income that have a largely offsetting impact. Firstly, we're increasing our estimated tax expense for the year by approximately $20 million.<br>And approximately 30% of that increase is a result of the new tax reform legislation with the remaining impact from the revisions to our forecast.<br>And again, we've updated our guidance based on our provisional view of tax reform impact, and the final impact could differ from our current<br>estimate.<br>
More than offsetting the increase in tax expense is higher equity in earnings from the pending sale of 8point3, which was previously not included<br>in our guidance. Combining the updates to net sales, tax and equity and earnings forecasts leads to a revised EPS range of $1.50 to $1.90. This is a<br>midpoint increase of $0.20 from the prior guidance.<br>
Capital expenditures have been increased by $50 million to reflect revised timing of some Series 6 capital outlays. The expected net cash balance<br>at the end of 2018 was increased by $500 million for a revised range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. The increase is a result of the higher-than-forecast<br>ending 2017 cash balance that incorporates the expected proceeds from the 8point3 transaction of $280 million, which includes the receipt of $50<br>million from the Stateline promissory notes.<br>
When we embarked on our Series 6 program, we were focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position throughout the<br>transition. From a starting point of $1.8 billion of net cash in Q4 '16 and with forecasted Series 6 CapEx over a 2-year period of $1.2 billion, we today<br>expect to end 2018 with a net cash balance approximately $400 million higher than our starting point at $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.<br>
Finally, I'll summarize our fourth quarter and 2017 progress on Slide 13. Firstly, we had tremendous success adding to our contracted pipeline in<br>2017 with net module bookings at 7.7 gigawatts. With the year-to-date 2018 module bookings of approximately 1.3 gigawatts, we're also off to a<br>strong start for this year.<br>
Secondly, our Series 6 road map continues to move according to plan. Our factory in Ohio remains on schedule towards commencing high volume<br>manufacturing in Q2. We're very pleased with the progress we're making on our transition to Series 6. Thirdly, we ended 2017 in a strong financial<br>position: net sales of $2.9 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $2.59 and net cash of $2.6 billion. And lastly we raised the midpoint of our EPS guidance by<br>$0.20 to $1.70 and raised our ending net cash by $500 million.<br>
And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.<br>
<b>Brian Lee</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - VP and Senior Clean Energy Analyst<br>
Just maybe first one for you, Mark. I thought the commentary around the development project pipeline, it sounds like it's seeing some better<br>momentum. So do you still see the 1 gigawatt baseline being the right target for 2018 and maybe more importantly for 2019? Or should we be<br>expecting some upside to that level at this point?<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
Brian, the way I look at it, let's hold kind of the gigawatt view at this point in time. We internally are continuing to pursue all opportunities that we<br>can at enhancing the systems pipeline whether it's development PPAs, whether it's utility-owned generation, whether it's working with large C&amp;I<br>customers, I'm happy with the momentum that we're seeing right now. We're also starting to see the announcement we had with APS and the<br>PV-plus-storage. We're seeing a lot more of that opportunity in the marketplace right now. So I think there's a tremendous amount of momentum<br>moving in that direction that we're very well positioned and we have a pretty robust pipeline of projects that we're pursuing. I think we're divesting<br>to do this right now as while we may be (inaudible) to move above that number over the horizon. I think let's stay at the 1 gigawatt, and we'll<br>continue to update you on our progress as we move forward.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll take our next question from Philip Shen with Roth Capital Partners.<br>
<b>Philip Lee-Wei Shen</b> - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst<br>
First one here is on ASPs. We've heard some chatter that you may be trying to increase ASPs on existing bookings post 201. Your module pricing<br>is up incrementally following the tariffs. Do you have any wiggle room in your contracts to increase your ASPs for your 7.7 gigawatts of bookings<br>through year-end '17? Or are they locked in? And also, does your 1.3 gigs in 2018 year-to-date reflect any of the higher pricing that the market has<br>experienced? Secondarily, we're also hearing that there may be some additional Series 6 capacity coming available for customers. Is this primarily<br>due to the additional Vietnam facility you talked about in December? Or are you contemplating yet another capacity expansion? I know you have<br>a lot in your plate with launching 5 facilities over 3 years, but what would it take to add yet another gigawatt of capacity sometime in the next<br>couple of years? Is that even realistic?<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
Yes. So on the ASP, I'll start with that first, Phil. I mean, again, the way we structured our contracts, that 7.7 gigawatt that you referenced, they were<br>firm, typically enforceable obligations between both counterparties. So those ASPs were firm fixed price ASPs in both directions, so there is no<br>room to move relative to that. And we're very happy with how we contracted that volume. So it's always one of those things you could look back<br>in hindsight and say should you have done anything differently. I'm very happy with what we did. I think we did everything we should have and<br>we did the right thing and best positioned us not only to best serve the needs of our customers but to enable the company and continue to grow.<br>As it relates to the 1.3 gigawatts that we booked since the beginning of the year, I mean, clearly, the business that has not been booked in the 1.3<br>is a carryforward as we started beginning of this year with the clarity around the 201 case. We engaged the market and we get market prices at<br>that point in time. So is there room potentially around Series 6 in particular to get maybe slightly better ASPs than we would have recognized<br>previously and then the 7.7 gigawatts or I guess the 2.6 that we booked to Series 6 last year? Clearly, there's always that opportunity. But it's --<br>again, it's a balanced take around how we engage with our customers from that perspective. But it's always we want to make sure that we're giving<br>

them the best quality, the best technology, enable them to be successful and to make sure we're getting the fair value for the technology that<br>we're providing. As it relates to the Series 6 capacity, we -- there are no firm commitment to this point in time to do anything but what we've already<br>indicated during our Analyst Day. Now what I will say, though, and Alex alluded to this a little bit in his remarks, as we look at the tax reform and<br>what's happening now with the U.S. corporate tax rate when you look at the media expensing, there's optionality potentially or there are scenarios<br>like -- or maybe it's a better we to say that we would look to -- in the U.S. to have additional manufacturing as part of our overall scenario analysis<br>across the global production platform, looking at the U.S. as a different lens that it would have otherwise before tax reform. And there is some<br>capability that potentially says that we could get -- if we made a decision to produce in the U.S. could we get some additional capacity between<br>now and, say, the 2020 or 20 -- beginning of 2020 time frame. Can we get a little bit more capacity? Potentially. It depends on how things play out.<br>At this scenario, we're going to continue to evaluate, no commitment at this point in time. But it wouldn't be in order of magnitude of 1 gigawatt.<br>We're talking a few hundred megawatts or so from that perspective. Nothing around Series 6 that would capture 1 gigawatt of upside over, say,<br>the next 2 years or so.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we will take our next question from Paul Coster with JPMorgan.<br>
<b>Mark Wesley Strouse</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Alternative Energy and Applied and Emerging Technologies Analyst<br>
This Mark Strouse on for Paul. So regarding the revised revenue outlook for 2018, can you provide a little bit more color how much of that was<br>driven by the timing of the international projects versus the Section 201, the increase in Series 4 production?<br>
<b>Alexander R. Bradley</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CFO<br>
Yes. Mark, so the increase is probably about $150 million rollover from the India assets. So you're going to see a relatively small piece coming from<br>the -- again, relatively small added capacity that we're putting on into various firms, the majority coming from the rollover of those Indian assets.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll take our next question from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.<br>
<b>Colin William Rusch</b> - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst<br>
Can you clarify how much of the bookings happened after the 201 decision was laid out? And then also if you could give us an update on where<br>we're at in terms of the historical storage solutions that you've been working on and working with partners on.<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
So I mean, if you think about the actual -- I guess the president made his final decision, and 201 was at the end of January. So I guess if you look at<br>the time line, we're about a month -- less than a month I guess from when that actual final decision was made. We had a significant amount of<br>momentum going into the bookings. Even before the announcement from -- the final decision. Now clearly there was indication of potential impact<br>around 201 case. Tariffs were being proposed by the commissioners to the president. So there has been indications in the marketplace -- stronger<br>indications as we progress to the second half of '17 clearly. And we've -- as we indicated as well, even in our mid- to late-stage pipeline, I mean,<br>we've got over 1 gigawatt of basically negotiated volume that sits within that pipeline just (inaudible). So what I would say is as you look at the<br>profile of the bookings as they evolve, let's say from the middle of '17 through today as well as plus what's in our mid- to late-stage pipeline as we<br>continue to move across that continuum, clearly, the indication of the overhang or the concern, I guess, maybe it's a better way to say it, of the<br>impact of 201 continue to increase over that horizon. But the other thing I want to make sure it's clear is we said this before. We have engaged our<br>

customers and we've done this in a risk-sharing approach, and we have not tried to do anything that would be opportunistic or to create some<br>form of windfall benefit to First Solar. And we look at this overall industry as having tremendous growth and potential. It is a marathon. It is not a<br>sprint. We want to have long-term relationships with our customers. We'll treat them fairly and we'll continue to give them the best technology in<br>the industry and provide the best power plant solutions and maintaining those power plant solutions over their anticipated life cycle. So that's<br>how we're thinking about kind of our customer engagement model and not to try to do something that would be short-term opportunistic to<br>adversely impact our long-term relationships.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll take our next question from...<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
I'm sorry. I think there was one other question on PVS. I'm sorry, I just want to make sure I got that one as well. Look, I think the deal that we've<br>done with APS, I think it's unique in the fact that -- and different than anything else that has been done so far. The PPA with APS is for 100% of the<br>battery components of the energy generation. It's all for power that are being delivered in the early evening hours. It was part of an all resource<br>RFP, where we competed head-to-head with mainly gas figures. They were looking for generation that was going to be dispatched in the, call it,<br>the 3 to 8 or even after 8:00 p.m. type of window. So we're generating the PV during the day. We're storing the energy in the batteries and then<br>we're dispatching it at a point in time of when there's the greatest need for that energy in the evening hours. And so that's creating a completely<br>different value proposition and kind of is changing the game around what are the fundamental economics of solar. It's not just looking at power<br>generation during the middle of the day. It's saying what can we do to create -- enhance value by having truly reliable, dispatchable, controllable<br>solar in the evening hours. So it's -- I think that more and more utilities will continue to evaluate what we've done there. I think you'll see more and<br>more momentum. We are continuing to see a tremendous amount of interest from our customers around thinking about storage. And whether it<br>sits today as part of the power plant or to look at the long-term optionality around how to integrate storage at some future date, that creates<br>optionality that they may want to take advantage of in the future especially in markets where the solar penetration is much lower than it is, say, in<br>California or even here in Arizona. But it's those types of kind of forward-looking and thought leadership kind of value propositions that we're able<br>to create with our customers. And I think there will be a lot of interest and people wanting to learn more about what we've done with APS, and<br>we're already getting some inquiries from customers.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll take our next question from Jeff Osborne with Cowen and Company.<br>
<b>Jeffrey David Osborne</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
A two-part question. So I think at the Analyst Day, you talked about 13.75 gigawatts of cumulative shipments between '18 and '20. I guess you've<br>got 9.1 gigawatts of that booked now. Where does that go with the Ohio decision that you made? And then also I think it was in the -- buried in<br>the footnotes, but can you just touch on the 700 megawatts of de-bookings that you saw during the year?<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
Yes. So right now, the way I would look at the -- if you look at the decision that we're going to continue to run 2 lines in Perrysburg, at this point in<br>time, think of it as a commitment for this year. So there's another, call it, a couple of hundred megawatts that we would -- in the supply plan relative<br>to what we would have said in the Analyst Day. We will continue to evaluate that production as we exit this year, do so we continue to run it into<br>'19, do we carry it into '20? If we did it across all 3 years, then you're talking in the range of about 600 megawatts if we chose to do that. So that's<br>-- if you think of it right now 200 megawatts, that's what we're committing to. We'll continue to evaluate when we make a decision to run that<br>production longer than that. And relative to the 700 of de-bookings, the largest one that we had during the year was a project which went by a<br>

couple of different names, either Tribal Solar or Fort Mojave depending on -- I'm not sure exactly what we -- how we called it in our SEC filings. So<br>that was a PPA that we had with California utility. And because of various reasons, the viability around that project, we ended up terminating that<br>PPA. So that was the picture. Then there was a handful of module agreements that we entered into, almost framework agreements that as we<br>looked at the viability of those framework agreements relative to incremental demand that we were seeing in the marketplace for our Series 4<br>product, there was an agreement between both parties that we terminated those framework agreements. So that's really what makes up that --<br>the de-bookings that we highlighted in the footnote.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we will take our next question from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.<br>
<b>Vishal B. Shah</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst<br>
Mark, can you maybe talk about the margin guidance? Is it just Series 4? Or is it something else that's driving the margin outlook for this year? And<br>also relative to the 201 case announcement, have you seen any change in pricing for your products? Have prices gone down or up relative to what<br>you guys were looking at late, late last year? And then as far as the 8point3 announcement goes, you guys at the time made some comments<br>around a challenging outlook for the utility scale power market just in terms of the fall of pricing, et cetera. So what's your sense of how the margins<br>in the utility scale market are looking right now relative to -- with the time of the Analyst Day?<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
Yes, let me -- I'll answer the 201 and then Alex can take the question on margin and 8point3. One thing that I want to go back to, the one question<br>around the de-bookings. I want to make sure that it's clear that those de-bookings were bookings that we had on our backlog. Actually in one case,<br>those bookings came in I think in 2015 -- the Tribal Solar I think was around 2015. The other framework agreements were 2016, okay? They had<br>nothing to do with any of the contracts that we have entered into in 2017. So as we've made comments that those are firm, enforceable obligations<br>with penalties, liquidation damages associated, these de-bookings had nothing to do with that because I know we continue to get asked the<br>question are these truly enforceable contracts. And I don't want the conclusion to be it's all de-bookings. No, this is an indication those truly were<br>not enforceable contracts. Nothing there was de-booked. Anything to do with anything we recognized in 2017, these were all much older contracts<br>from that standpoint. As it relates to the 201 case, Vishal, we've -- as I tried to indicate before, we're trying to find a way that we can find a win-win<br>for our customers. We want to make sure that their projects are viable, that we're getting fair value for the technology. It also allows us to be<br>somewhat selective with who we choose to engage with in a highly creditworthy type of counterparties and others. So we can be more selective<br>from that perspective and giving the best technology that enables their business model which, obviously, enables ours as well in the other things.<br>We're booking, as we indicated. But if you look at the mid- to late-stage pipeline, our bookings profile dips out in 2020 and really almost towards<br>the end of 2020 and even in 2021. Those are somewhat uncharted territory for us. So for me to tell you what that pricing looks like relative to before<br>and after the 201, it's hard for me to give you a line of sight for that because that momentum has only started to happen over, I would say, the last<br>quarter or so. So you can't really indicate movement one way or the other because we're largely sold out through '18, '19 and the first half of 2020<br>right now. So our bookings opportunities are that much further out in the horizon. What I'll tell you is that when I look at those -- on the ASPs that<br>are out there, relative to our road map of Series 6 and where we're going with that technology, I'm pleased. I think it lines up with all of our<br>expectations in that regard. So I'll let Alex answer the other 2.<br>
<b>Alexander R. Bradley</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CFO<br>
Yes. So Vishal, regarding the margins, I mean, the margin profile that we gave at our Analyst Day I think still holds. So what you're seeing is perhaps<br>a slight increase in margin, but this here is a function of some of the systems projects that we have. We're still pleased where the margins are in<br>Series 4 products, which are in line with what we guided to in December. Around 8point3 and the challenging outlook potentially at that utility<br>scale market, I'd say, look, as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, we ran a very comprehensive process. Over 130 potential buyers were<br>contacted. And while we clearly would have liked to have got to a better outcome in terms of price, we do believe it's the best deal out there in<br>

the market. But it's a little bit different from how we look at future utility scale deals. So there's a bit of a difference in that situation. At the time we<br>were out marketing 8point3, you had -- NRG yield was also in the market, which added a little bit in terms of a less competitive situation. You'd<br>always rather have less assets rather than more in the market at the same time. We also had the Southern Company that owned the majority interest<br>in a lot of the projects in 8point3 were out marketing a piece of their broader solar portfolio at the same time. 8point3 has minority ownership in<br>some of the projects, and therefore, that's different to buyer who can purchase a new project outright and have a controlling interest. You also<br>have a mix of utility scale as well as there's resi and C&amp;I projects in that portfolio. The capital structure of 8point3 today had non-amortizing debt,<br>so that would have to be replaced in time in amortizing as you sold that portfolio. The asset level structures were already in place around the tax<br>equities. There's less flexibility for a new buyer there, and there's also some less flexibility of optimizing other value streams to buyers around O&amp;M<br>for instance.<br>
<b>Alexander R. Bradley</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CFO<br>
When I think about the result of 8point3 relative to I think about the viability of the ongoing utility scale business, I think there are clearly some<br>differences there which give me comfort that although clearly, we preferred a higher number on 8point3 relative to where we ended up, it doesn't<br>give me significant doubts around our ability to successfully monetize our existing utility scale portfolio at the margins that we've guided to.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we will take our last question from David Katter with Baird.<br>
<b>Tyler Charles Frank</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Associate<br>
This is Tyler Frank. I was hoping you can discuss how would you think about margins over the longer term. Having -- since you have the contracts<br>already locked in and I assume prices, and if things go to plan with the cost road map, should we expect margin expansion (inaudible) '19 and<br>2020, if that's all the information you have today?<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
Yes. So there's -- Tyler, there's a lot of moving pieces in there and I'm not give you kind of a margin range. But what I'll say is look, as we move<br>forward, when we transition everything into Series 6 as an example, we've eliminated the form factor delta and the higher BoS cost, right? So now<br>we've got a product that is a form factor equivalent and BoS neutral, right, potentially advantaged depending on the application and with an<br>energy yield advantage. So that creates a tremendously competitive product that as we move from 4 into 6 would give us opportunity to see gross<br>margin expansion. There's no doubt about that. In terms of what does that profile look like, there's still way too many to moving pieces at this point<br>in time to represent that. But the other thing I want to make sure, and we've highlighted this in the Analyst Day is the -- if you're talking gross<br>margin versus op margin, I think op margin. And if we can manage to scale against our fixed cost structure, we're going to see very strong contribution<br>margin leveraged against a fixed cost structure through OpEx that's going to drive op margin expansion. So growth and scale will be more impactful<br>as it relates to op margin expansion per se than just the transition from 4 to 6 and whether or not where my ASP versus cost entitlement is around<br>Series 6. That's going to be a critical enabler but equally if not -- and like I said, probably more importantly, it's going to be our ability to scale against<br>our fixed cost to drive op margin expansion.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. It also ends the First Solar conference call. We thank you all for your participation<br>and you may now disconnect.<br>

<b>3. </b>EIX holding co. had better-than-expected cost performance in 4Q and this contributed to positive overall results.<br><b>4. </b>Aforementioned results exclude non-core impact of tax reform and revised SONGS settlement.<br><b>5. </b>On 02/22/18, Board of Directors declared its 1Q common stock dividend of $0.605 per share.<br>
<b>a. </b>Prior to declaring the dividend, Board evaluated the information available, including information pertaining to wildfires<br>
in Dec. 2017 and mudslides in Montecito in Jan. 2018, and determined that the California law requirements for declaration<br>were met.<br>
<b>B. Wildfires:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Wildfires pose a risk statewide, impacting entire economy.<br><b>2. </b>Communities across California have been tragically affected as climate change has increased severity and frequency of<br>
wildfires in recent years.<br>
<b>a. </b>Long-term drought in California and forest management policies have resulted in build-up of unmanaged vegetation.<br>
<b>i. </b>State has nearly 130m dead trees on approx. 9m acres due to prolonged drought conditions and bark beetle infestation.<br>
<b>b. </b>Combination of these conditions, along with decades of more buildings being permitted and constructed in higher fire<br>
risk areas, have contributed to catastrophic wildfires, with eight of the state's 20 most destructive wildfires having occurred<br>in just last three years.<br>
<b>3. </b>Prevention and mitigation of catastrophic wildfires with sufficient fire suppression resources, and effective policies around<br>
vegetation management, hazardous fuels reduction, and zoning regulations for residential and commercial development<br>in high fire risk areas.<br>
<b>4. </b>State's infrastructure must be hardened, with stronger building codes in high fire risk areas.<br>
<b>a. </b>Utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure must also partner with state agencies on improved standards for<br>
climate resilient infrastructure.<br>
<b>b. </b>As Co. thinks about how it design and operate system, EIX should consider that roughly a qtr. of service territory is in<br>
designated high-fire risk areas.<br>
<b>c. </b>Should evaluate safety impacts, along with reliability and cost tradeoffs, of steps like:<br>
<b>i. </b>Undergrounding more distribution network in selected areas.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Installing steel or composite poles instead of wood ones in specific locations.<br>
<b>iii. </b>Using further preventive public safety shutoffs of power under high-risk conditions like red flag warnings, which Co.<br>
has done selectively in past.<br>
<b>5. </b>When catastrophic event occurs in spite of all these efforts, Co. needs thoughtful policies around how financial risks are<br>
allocated, including fire suppression costs and damages.<br>
<b>6. </b>California's courts have held investor-owned utilities strictly liable.<br>
<b>a. </b>Regardless of fault, for property damages and attorney's fees if utility equipment is found to be substantial cause of<br>
wildfire.<br>
<b>b. </b>California courts have held utilities liable regardless of fault by applying principle of inverse condemnation; principle<br>
typically applicable to government, not to private entities.<br>
<b>i. </b>Assumption is that, like government entity that can pass along to its taxpayers costs and risks incurred for public good,<br>
IOUs can socialize wildfire costs among their customers in rates.<br>
<b>c. </b>CPUC recently denied San Diego Gas &amp; Electric's application for cost recovery of about $380m of costs above their insurance<br>
coverage.<br>
<b>7. </b>Sees legal, regulatory and legislative policy pathways to resolve aforementioned issues.<br>
<b>a. </b>Recently filed a motion in round fire case, 2015 fire near Bishop, California.<br>
<b>i. </b>Challenging the application of inverse condemnation.<br>
<b>b. </b>On 02/21/18, filed a motion for leave to file an amicus in PG&amp;E Butte fire case also challenging the application of inverse.<br>
<b>i. </b>In regulatory arena, filed joint application with PG&amp;E for rehearing of CPUC's decision in SDG&amp;E's Wildfire Expense<br>
Memorandum Account (WEMA) application.<br>
<b>c. </b>Recently filed comments in PG&amp;E's Butte fire WEMA.<br>
<b>8. </b>Legislative policy changes:<br>
<b>a. </b>Believes that allocation of costs and financial risk must be addressed.<br>
<b>i. </b>That starts with exploring ways to reform the application of inverse condemnation with strict liability to utilities.<br>

<b>ii. </b>Includes addressing high cost of fire suppression, which typically exceeds state budget levels each year.<br>
<b>b. </b>Increasingly high premiums for wildfire insurance coverage should be a part of discussion, as they affect parties far beyond<br>
utility sector.<br>
<b>c. </b>Despite Co.'s best efforts and sense of urgency, all of this will take time and creates uncertainty.<br>
<b>9. </b>Believes that the state will ultimately address the risks and issues surrounding wildfires and other climate change impacts<br>
because California's ambitious environmental policies require strong, healthy utilities.<br>
<b>C. Trends For Foreseeable Future:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Key trends providing strong growth engine at utility for foreseeable future.<br><b>2. </b>Last Oct., SCE released a white paper that outlines Co.'s blueprint for California to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air<br>
pollution by its ambitious 2030 goal.<br>
<b>a. </b>Clean power and electrification pathway has received great response and support from community organizations,<br>
customers, environmentalists and labor unions.<br>
<b>i. </b>Estimates that, to meet 2030 goals, California must have robust, modern electric grid supplied by 80% carbon-free<br>
energy.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Believes California will need more than 7m electric vehicles, and electrification of one-third of space and water heaters<br>
in increasingly energy-efficient buildings.<br>
<b>iii. </b>Continues to engage in significant outreach to key stakeholders and pursue initiatives to help state meet California's<br>
2030 goals.<br>
<b>b. </b>Related initiative is transportation electrification application that was filed in Jan. 2017 that included $574m of potential<br>
CapEx in two groupings; fast track projects and longer-term projects which will require more detailed consideration.<br>
<b>c. </b>Last month, Commission approved five of the six fast track priority projects Co. proposed totaling $10m in CapEx.<br>
<b>d. </b>Commission process continues with respect to longer term review projects.<br>
<b>i. </b>Still expecting a proposed decision in 2Q.<br>
<b>3. </b>Energy storage is big component of electric grid in Co.'s analysis.<br>
<b>a. </b>Legislation is beginning to reflect this as well.<br><b>b. </b>Assembly Bill 2868, signed in 2016, added opportunities for programs and investments of additional 500 megawatts of<br>
distribution-level energy storage systems, distributed equally among the IOUs.<br>
<b>i. </b>SCE's share is 166 megawatts.<br>
<b>4. </b>On 03/01/18 Co. will file Energy Storage Procurement and Investment Plan application, which will include AB 2868 proposals<br>
for Energy Storage Programs and Investments, in addition to the usual procurement of energy storage through other RFOs.<br>
<b>5. </b>With respect to 2018 general rate case, Co. filed updated testimony on 02/16/18 to reflect impacts of tax reform.<br>
<b>a. </b>Has hearing date set for 03/19/18 to discuss this updated testimony and any comments provided by intervenors.<br><b>b. </b>Once that hearing is completed, Co. will see if Administrative Law Judges require any other briefings before issuing a<br>
proposed decision.<br>
<b>c. </b>Cannot speculate on timing for a proposed decision and subsequent Commission decision, but given where Co. is today,<br>
would expect the final decision before year-end.<br>
<b>D. SONGS:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Announced revised settlement that was due to multiple mediation sessions in 2017 and Jan. 2018 with diversed set of<br>
parties.<br>
<b>a. </b>Weighed reasonable range of potential outcomes and determined that this outcome is in the best interest of customers<br>
and shareholders.<br>
<b>b. </b>If approved by CPUC, this settlement will eliminate further uncertainty and bring will closure to what otherwise could<br>

<b>a. </b>Arising from lower tax benefits on stock-based compensation at holding co., partially offset by improved results of $0.02<br>
per share at competitive businesses.<br>
<b>5. </b>SCE and EIX results in 4Q17 were impacted by two significant non-core items:<br>
<b>a. </b>Revised SONGS settlement.<br><b>b. </b>Tax reform.<br>
<b>6. </b>SCE had $1.48 per share of non-core charges, this relates to:<br>
<b>a. </b>$448m after-tax charge, or $1.38 per share, associated with revised SONGS settlement.<br><b>b. </b>$33m charge, or $0.10 per share, related to tax reform.<br>
<b>7. </b>EIX Parent and Other had $1.29 per share of non-core charges, largely related to tax reform.<br>
<b>a. </b>Remeasurement of deferred taxes resulted in $433m expense, or $1.33 per share.<br><b>b. </b>Will continue to utilize net operating losses and credits.<br>
<b>8. </b>Based on current analysis, EIX expects to become a cash taxpayer in 2025.<br>
<b>B. 2017 Results:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Core EPS increased $0.53 YoverY.<br>
<b>a. </b>Includes $0.44 per share of increased revenue related to attrition mechanism in SCE's 2015 general rate case.<br>
<b>2. </b>Many earnings drivers for full-year 2017 are similar to qtr.<br><b>3. </b>At SCE, lower operation and maintenance costs contributed $0.07 per share to overall performance over 2016.<br><b>4. </b>EIX Parent and Other realized significant tax benefits in 2017.<br>

<b>C. 2018 SCE General Rate Case (GRC):</b><br>
<b>1. </b>While Co. continues to wait for a decision on SCE's 2018 general rate case, SCE has developed, and is executing against 2018<br>
CapEx plan that will allow SCE to ramp up its CapEx program over three-year GRC period (2018 through 2020).<br>
<b>a. </b>To meet what is ultimately authorized in decision while minimizing associated risk of unauthorized spending.<br>
<b>2. </b>Will focus initial grid mod spending on capital that provides safety and reliability benefits while deferring most spending<br>
that is primarily focused on integration of distributed energy resources.<br>
<b>3. </b>While Co. continues to present 2019 and 2020 capital forecast at current GRC request level, EIX adjusted CPUC CapEx in<br>
2018 to $3.6b to reflect latest planning for the year.<br>
<b>4. </b>Made updates throughout forecast period for changes in FERC projects.<br><b>5. </b>Total 2018 CPUC and FERC CapEx plan is $4.2b.<br><b>6. </b>While Co. waits for outcome related to 2018 GRC, over long-term, Co. continues to see SCE investing at least $4b per year<br>
and adding at least $2b per year of rate base for foreseeable future as SCE focuses on investments in grid and continues to<br>be a key enabler of California's ambitious climate change policies.<br>
<b>D. SCE Rate Base Forecast:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>CPUC rate base forecast is based on weighted avg. rate base that Co. requested in GRC for forward-looking three-year period,<br>
it reflects 2018 through 2020 request level CapEx.<br>
<b>2. </b>Once SCE receives final decision in 2018 GRC, rate base forecast will be updated to reflect authorized levels.<br>
<b>a. </b>At that time, Co. will also update CapEx for 2019 and 2020.<br>
<b>3. </b>Updated rate base forecast to reflect the impact of tax reform, changes in latest FERC capital forecast and additional incentive<br>
CWIP treatment for certain FERC projects.<br>

<A name=321></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, EIX - Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call<br>
<b>4. </b>Impacted changes since Nov. update:<br>
<b>a. </b>Tax reform has little impact on 2018 rate base, but by 2020, it increases rate base by $400m.<br>
<b>i. </b>Increase is mainly related to elimination of bonus depreciation.<br>
<b>b. </b>During 4Q17, FERC approved incentive CWIP treatment for three additional transmission projects:<br>
<b>i. </b>Alberhill.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Mesa.<br>
<b>iii. </b>Eldorado-Lugo-Mohave.<br>
<b>c. </b>Aforementioned incentive treatment means that Co. can add CapEx related to those projects to rate base in the year they<br>
are spent rather than waiting for project to be placed into service.<br>
<b>d. </b>Thereby, rate base is approx. $500m higher by 2020.<br>
<b>i. </b>This increase is offset by reduced CapEx due to improved cost efficiency and revisions of project scope and schedule<br>
related to FERC capital projects and programs.<br>
<b>e. </b>Cost efficiencies and reduced scope account for approx. one-third of change in CapEx.<br>
<b>i. </b>Remaining two-thirds represents timing shift that will be added to rate base outside forecast window.<br>
<b>E. Current FERC Formula Rate Proceeding:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Key matter in that proceeding is the determination of authorized ROE.<br><b>2. </b>In Dec. 2017, FERC ruled that requested formula rate would go into effect 01/01/18 subject to refund.<br>
<b>a. </b>While Co. is collecting requested ROE for FERC-related revenues during 2018, these dollars will be adjusted and refunded<br>
depending upon final decision in proceeding.<br>
<b>3. </b>ROE request is comprised of base ROE of 10.3% plus 50 BP CAISO participation adder for total ROE of 10.8% before individual<br>
project incentives.<br>
<b>4. </b>Weighted avg. of individual project incentives increases requested ROE to equivalent of about 11.5% based on current<br>
CapEx plan.<br>
<b>5. </b>In Dec. ruling, FERC also approved 50 BP CAISO participation adder.<br>
<b>a. </b>CPUC has intervened in FERC rate proceeding and has requested an application for rehearing on approval of this adder.<br>
<b>6. </b>FERC also directed the parties to commence settlement discussions and parties are scheduled to reconvene at FERC on<br>
05/15/18.<br>
<b>a. </b>Hearings will be held if parties do not ultimately settle.<br>
<b>7. </b>Cannot speculate on outcome of this proceeding or timeline.<br>
<b>F. Other Details:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Will not be providing 2018 earnings guidance until Co. receives final decision on general rate case.<br><b>2. </b>Co. lists some key considerations outside of simplified rate base model.<br>
<b>a. </b>Market for wildfire insurance for California IOUs is becoming more strained.<br>
<b>i. </b>Availability is declining while simultaneously premiums are going up.<br>
<b>ii. </b>In late Dec., Co. notified Commission that SCE secured $300m of wildfire insurance for 2018 calendar year and requested<br>
the Commission approve recovery of associated premium of approx. $121m.<br>
<b>iii. </b>Believes Co. has strong case for recovery, until CPUC addresses Co.'s request, one should assume additional $0.29 per<br>
share drag on earnings in 2018.<br>
<b>iv. </b>There may also be additional insurance costs that are in excess of what Co. has requested in GRC.<br>
<b>v. </b>Does not yet have information regarding overall cost however.<br>
<b>b. </b>While Co. is not providing guidance for SCE, does expect EIX Parent and Other EPS drag to be $0.25-0.30 for 2018.<br>
<b>i. </b>Increase is related to lower tax shield due to lower corporate tax rate and higher interest expense.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Includes EPS of Edison Energy, which is expected to improve in 2018 over prior year results as Co. continues to work<br>
towards goal of a run-rate breakeven level of earnings by 2019-end.<br>
<b>c. </b>Has not included any tax benefits related to share based compensation which was a significant factor in 2017 performance.<br>
<b>3. </b>On 02/16/18, filed updated testimony in GRC proceeding to include impacts of tax reform legislation on CPUC-jurisdictional<br>
revenue requirement.<br>
<b>a. </b>Now requesting 2018 revenue requirement of $5.534b.<br>

<b>i. </b>Down $106m from 2017 revenue requirement.<br>
<b>b. </b>Post-test year revenue requirements have also decreased from prior request.<br>
<b>c. </b>Estimates this latest update will result in approx. 3% CAGR in total rates between 2017 and 2020.<br>
<b>4. </b>Will remain focused on ways to mitigate customer rate impacts while continuing to invest in electric grid infrastructure.<br>
<b>G. Balance Sheet:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>EIX and SCE continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility.<br>
<b>a. </b>At EIX, Co. issued $500m, one-year term loan in Jan. to partially pay down commercial paper program.<br><b>b. </b>At SCE, avg. common equity component of total capitalization was 50% as of 12/31/17 including the charge from revised<br>
SONGS settlement.<br>
<b>i. </b>If approved by CPUC, revised settlement allows SCE to exclude $448m after-tax charge from its equity capitalization<br>
ratio.<br>
<b>2. </b>Tax reform results in lower revenue requirement and lower customer rates although rate base will increase due to elimination<br>
of bonus depreciation.<br>
<b>3. </b>Considering aforementioned items and given potential for large capital program based on GRC request and other potential<br>
investments in support of state's clean energy objectives, Co. will likely see increased financing needs in future as higher<br>CapEx is followed by related growth in authorized rate base and earnings.<br>
<b>a. </b>Will continually assess the most cost-effective approach to financing.<br><b>b. </b>Could consider optimizing the use of short and long-term debt at either EIX or SCE.<br>
<b>4. </b>Pleased that Co. is able to benefit from prudently conservative balance sheets EIX has maintained at SCE and holding co.<br>
as Co. continues to invest in SCE.<br>
<b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.<br>
<b>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director and Head of the US Power, Utilities, &amp; Alternative<br>Energy Equity Research<br>
I wanted to first follow up on the change in the parent drag. How are you thinking about mitigating this over time? I know you just<br>are talking about kind of preliminary '18 guidance here and we're already asking you how you think about it into the future. But<br>obviously, it's a pretty meaningful move. Can you give us any thoughts on the breakdown of what exactly is in that approximately<br>quarter of drag and how that evolves?<br>
<b>Maria C. Rigatti</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Sure. So I think in the past, we've said a penny and a half per month. I think this looks more like $0.02 per month, plus whatever<br>Edison Energy is doing. Obviously, over time, the Edison Energy number is one that we are working towards a breakeven run rate<br>by the end of 2019, so that will be part of the approach to minimize that drag. And at the holding company, tax reform has had an<br>impact on us. While we believe that from a deductibility perspective, we'll be able to allocate that expense, the fact that we just had<br>less of a tax shield as a result of the lower tax rate is having an impact.<br>
We always look at operating cost efficiencies from the conversation we just had, or the remarks that we just made that we actually<br>benefit a little bit in the fourth quarter at the holding company from lower costs. That will be our approach, the same one we've<br>used at the balance of the company.<br>

<A name=323></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, EIX - Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call<br>
<b>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director and Head of the US Power, Utilities, &amp; Alternative<br>Energy Equity Research<br>
Excellent. And I wanted to follow up on the dividend. Just in terms of the comfort level that the board obviously had in declaring<br>the latest dividend, how do you think about that evolving as you learn more about the potential exposures here? Maybe said<br>differently, with respect to the discrete test that you had to evaluate the latest dividend, how do you think about potential risks of<br>reevaluating that in subsequent quarters here?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Julien, I'll take that. This is Pedro. I think like I said in my remarks, our board looked at a broad range of potential negative outcomes<br>here. I know that we're not putting out a specific estimates that we may have or the like, and I also recognize that a number of analysts<br>have put out their own sets of ranges out there. But suffice it to say, we took a look at a good broad range of potential outcomes<br>here based on the information we have at hand and the board felt we're very comfortable making this quarterly dividend decision.<br>
In the normal course, we always update you on dividend actions. We typically have talked about potential adjustments in annual<br>dividend levels at the end of the year, but then we validate as a board and do actual board approval quarter-by-quarter. And that's<br>again our normal course, and that remains our normal course. So a quarter from now, we'll be having the next discussion on that<br>quarterly dividend.<br>
Again, we did look at a broad range of potential outcomes here, so there would have to be some very new information that the<br>changes that range of outcomes to affect the thinking further. I think that's about the best way that I can frame it at this point, Julian.<br>Does that help?<br>
<b>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director and Head of the US Power, Utilities, &amp; Alternative<br>Energy Equity Research<br>
Yes, absolutely. So you included the mudslides and the totality of the events that have occurred as best you understand it?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I've stayed purposefully vague here, but we did say that we looked at -- we did look at the potential impacts from all these things<br>that happened. We're not commenting on causation and the like, but the board did take a look at that potential range of impacts<br>from all these various events.<br>
So I think we've taken a very diligent approach as directors at looking at a lot of ways in which under California regulations and law<br>that could impact the company and felt very comfortable about the rigor behind the broad look that we took.<br>

<b>Stephen Calder Byrd</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Head of North American Research for the Power and Utilities<br>and Clean Energy<br>
I wanted to talk about fire insurance. And I think you talked a bit about this in your prepared remarks. But just generally, as you think<br>about the cost and availability of fire insurance, I guess, really both for you, but more broadly for your customers and for others in<br>the region, we hear some concerns about areas becoming uninsurable or costs rising significantly. How do you see that evolving in<br>California? And I guess relatedly, do you see a political awareness in the legislative body in terms of the need to be thinking about<br>this holistically?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
This is Pedro. And I'll start this one and Maria or others may want to comment from the management team.<br>
First of all, you have to date up this insurance forms that we purchased, as Maria described in her comments. I think it's safe to say<br>that's probably the most expensive premium we've paid for insurance ever. So that alone is a data point on -- there was availability,<br>but at a much steeper cost than we've seen before. And as we continue to head into the market to secure different elements, different<br>tranches of our towers, we are continuing to see a very tight market.<br>
But to your point on awareness, that's frankly part of our job right now, to make sure that we are making policymakers aware and<br>we're fully engaged on that. I mentioned in my remarks that we are engaged with the entire community of policymakers out there,<br>from the governor's office, through to key legislators. We are doing a lot of that jointly with other utilities or other groups that are I<br>think aware of the issues here across the state. And again, it's part of not just a utility issue, it's part of a statewide issue here that we<br>think the severity and the frequency of these fires continues to go the way it's gone over the last 3 years. It's going to continue to<br>put added pressure on the insurance market and other parts of the economy. So we've taken it on ourselves to make sure that we<br>are knocking on a whole lot of doors in Sacramento right now, making sure folks are aware and bringing some of our ideas to the<br>table of what reforms might be needed to solve this statewide issue.<br>
Maria or Adam, anyone from General Counsel, anything you want to add?<br>
<b>Maria C. Rigatti</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
I'd just say I think it's something that the regulators really need to pay attention to. When we filed our GRC, people were very<br>appreciative of the $85 million in O&amp;M costs that we had taken out of the system and this sort of insurance premium completely<br>swamps that. And it does get recovered in our General Rate Cases, we applied for that, so customers will ultimately bear very high<br>costs unless and until we can make people aware of the issue.<br>
<b>Stephen Calder Byrd</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Head of North American Research for the Power and Utilities<br>and Clean Energy<br>
Okay. Just maybe one follow-up on physically as we think about your utility system. Is there a lot of co-location telecom equipment<br>with your equipment? Or how do you broadly think about the degree to which there is that co-location of there of telecom equipment<br>with yours?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I don't know that we have a fact or figure handy right now, but I'll turn it over to Kevin Payne. Short answer is there is certainly some<br>level of co-location across the system. Kevin, anything you would add?<br>

<b>Kevin M. Payne</b> - Southern California Edison Company - CEO and Director<br>
Yes. We've looked at the high fire areas in particular and usually about 70% of our facilities are -- have co-location with other utilities.<br>Is there something specific about that you're interested in or...<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
The next question comes from Christopher Turnure, J.P. Morgan.<br>
<b>Christopher James Turnure</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst<br>
I wanted to make sure I had a clear understanding of the role of various agencies in the Thomas fire investigation. Is Cal Fire definitely<br>the lead agency there? Are there any local fire departments involved? And is there any investigations pertaining directly to the<br>mudslides that would be separate from that, that you're aware of?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Let me pass it over to Adam Umanoff, our General Counsel, Christopher.<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
Christopher, you're correct. Cal Fire is the lead fire investigation agency as they typically are in fires where they're actively involved<br>in suppression. Separate from Cal Fire, we understand that the Ventura County Fire Department is conducting some level of<br>investigation.<br>
In addition, the safety and enforcement division of the California Public Utility Commission will be conducting an investigation.<br>Those are the investigations that we know are ongoing.<br>

<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
I wish we could give you some comfort on timing. We wish we had more comfort on timing, we don't. These investigations historically<br>have taken anywhere between 12 and 18 months to complete. And I think we have to stick with that as a suggested time frame, but<br>there's really no certainty with regard to the time element of these investigations.<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Adam, these investigations are very much case-by-case based on the facts that investigators pursue.<br>
<b>Christopher James Turnure</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Okay. And then in terms of your legal strategy out of the gate here in the court system, is there anything that you can tell us in this<br>early stage that might make your strategy differ from some of your peers or differ from that engaged by PG&amp;E in the Butte fire last<br>year? I realize it's obviously still early there and you're probably limited in what you can say, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts.<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
Well, you're correct. It's very, very early. The investigation around cause has just commenced, so I think it really is premature to<br>speculate as to what the ultimate strategy will be. You will see, as we've seen in other large fires like this, an effort to coordinate<br>before a single judge, the numerous lawsuits that are brought. And in fact, there is a motion to coordinate the various lawsuits that<br>have currently been brought in the Thomas fire. That's a procedural step to hopefully make the litigation more efficient, but that's<br>really at the early stages as well. So not much more we can tell at this point.<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Adam, maybe I would add and I totally agree with how you framed it and these things are really case-by-case, depending on the<br>facts in any given case. If you move up, though, to the 10,000-foot level, I think you're seeing indications that from a policy perspective,<br>not from an individual, legal strategy from an individual case, but from a policy perspective, there's a lot of good discussion and<br>coordination with our other peer utilities in the state. And you've seen, as I mentioned in my comments, we joined with PG&amp;E in<br>filing the application for the hearing in the San Diego WEMA case. We filed an amicus in the PG&amp;E Butte case. So I think there's a<br>recognition that the broader themes around policy and moving beyond just inverse condemnation, that support for a number of<br>actions across the economy, across fire prevention and hardening infrastructure and costs and risk allocation, those are ones where<br>at that 10,000-foot level it's so important that we be aligned, and we are.<br>

<A name=327></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, EIX - Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call<br>
<b>Praful Mehta</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director<br>
Pedro, you made a point on the call to mention that all this fix around inverse condemnation is going to take some time. Just wanted<br>to get a little bit more color on that, both from the legislative and legal side. What kind of timing are you thinking about in terms of<br>solving inverse condemnation right now?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, again, this is one where, I think, we can give you a sense of that will take time, but it's very hard to pin down, here's the calendar<br>or here's facing high ends at this very early stage. But let's take it in pieces. There are legal strategies, and so those play themselves<br>out in individual cases. And I mentioned the Butte case with PG&amp;E or the Round fire case where we made our filing, right? So there's<br>a track around each of those cases. There's a PUC regulatory track, right? And I don't think that we have a clarity yet in terms of the<br>timing for the PUC to consider the various applications for rehearing in that San Diego WEMA case or the PG&amp;E WEMA case activity<br>there. So typical and I'm looking around at Ron Nichols here, but typical CPUC time lines, certainly, it can be in the many months to<br>a couple of years sort of time frame.<br>
Then finally, to the extent that legislative policy changes attract something that we're also looking at, that happens in cycles of<br>legislative sessions. And so we have a session that runs through later this year. It's a possibility of next year's session. So we -- I will<br>tell you we are certainly advocating about the sense of urgency on this, and we would love to see traction in this legislative session<br>on some of these key pieces, but it's still early days and that's not guaranteed. As I mentioned in my comments, the deadline for bills<br>has passed, but you can still get changes in those vehicles. So there's always a possibility that as we continue to engage with legislators,<br>we could see changes in the vehicles that are available already and bills that have been filed.<br>
So that could be a this year thing or it might take longer to help build the momentum and build the case and it could extend into<br>the next legislative session.<br>
So I'm sorry, I think I took a lot of airtime there to say it's too early to tell. But hopefully, it gives you some color around some of the<br>other pathways.<br>
<b>Praful Mehta</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director<br>
Yes. No, that's super helpful color. So I appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up on the legislative side. Is Senate Bill 819 still the<br>right starting point? Is that what you're working towards in terms of improving or changing or tweaking? Or is there a completely<br>different bill? What's the approach on the legislative side, I guess?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Ron, do you want to?<br>
<b>Ronald Owen Nichols</b> - Edison International - President of Southern California Edison<br>
There are a number of bills out there. So there really isn't any one specific bill that's been selected at this point that might be modified.<br>There's vehicles there that can be addressed over time as the session goes on.<br>

<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
And I think it's fair to say that, in general, the bills are addressing very specific issues. You're seeing, for example, a number of bills<br>around dealing with residential insurance benefits and extending provisions for them and whatnot. What we are advocating for as<br>you can tell from our comments here is a set of a more comprehensive solutions that deal with this statewide problem across all the<br>different elements. Now that degree of difficulty then becomes harder because so you're looking for more comprehensive pieces<br>of action. And that's why I'm saying it's so early days.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Thank you for the comments on this Round fire case on inverse condemnation, I read that earlier in the week. I was curious if you<br>have any sense of where that is in its process. I know you filed the brief, but are you -- is there a date on which the court is set to hear<br>it or anything like that?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
That's a great question for a lawyer. Adam?<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
Jonathan, it's Adam. The motion -- the court has set the hearing date to hear our motion for April 2. And that date can slip. It's always<br>subject to change.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And is -- then you could see either a ruling or more process after that date, just we're made -- wait to be seen around April 2,<br>is that the right way to think about that?<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
I think that's right. A lot depends on what the trial court does. If the trial court denies the motion, there's always the opportunity for<br>us to appeal. These issues may very well require appellate court review, not be settled at the trial court level. And that would take<br>some significant additional time.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Am I correct that in this particular case, the stage it's at, people have just asked for inverse condemnation to be applied to the utility,<br>but the court has yet to rule on whether that should be allowed?<br>

<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
Yes, that's a good way -- Jonathan, that's a good way to describe it. In most of these cases, the plaintiffs alleged that the standard of<br>care that we have to comply with is strict liability arising from the application of inverse condemnation. They simply plead it. And<br>we have to defend that, or in this case, we challenge it.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
So in the Butte fire case, the PG&amp;E is trying to overturn a finding. And in your case, you're trying to sort of prevent one, effectively.<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
I can't speak to the procedural status of the Butte case. I don't believe that there's been a final determination. I know they are<br>challenging the application of inverse condemnation.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Yes. So I guess my question was in this case has it also been applied or is it yet to be applied, I just wanted to be sure on that.<br>
<b>Adam Seth Umanoff</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; General Counsel<br>
It has not yet been applied in the Round fire case.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Great. And then just, Maria, towards the end of your comments, you were talking about higher financing needs and how you could<br>look at some holdco debt or incremental debt at the utilities. You didn't specifically mention equity, and obviously, equity hasn't<br>been part of the story of EIX, certainly since I've been involved in covering the company. But it seems like you might have been at<br>least floating that possibility, even though you didn't name it. Am I hearing that right or...<br>
<b>Maria C. Rigatti</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Jonathan, I think what I was really trying to say was that we have had a number of things that's affected other companies as well in<br>terms of tax reform and the like. And we've also had some cash flow impacts from assuming the SONGS settlement is approved, we<br>have some cash flow impacts there as well. And we are waiting for our rate case to come, and we have a number of other proceedings<br>where we're also requesting capital. So there's a lot out there, and we're going to stay flexible in terms of how we finance that, either<br>at EIX or SCE, either with short-term debt or long-term debt. I think that's really all I was really trying to say right now.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And then just to bring it up there. In the SONGS settlement, you've asked for this adjustment of the calculation of the equity<br>ratio. Is the settlement contingent on the commission approving that aspect of it? Or what would happen if they decided there<br>wasn't a case made for that particular element?<br>

<b>Maria C. Rigatti</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Well, certainly, the settlement on -- all of the parties have agreed to support all of the elements of the settlement. The CPUC is going<br>through their process. At this point, I think it's too early to really speculate on that.<br>
<b>Ronald Owen Nichols</b> - Edison International - President of Southern California Edison<br>
This is Ron. I just would add to that, that the settlement provides for any material modification to it has to be agreed to by the parties.<br>
<b>Jonathan P. Arnold</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. So it might be hard for the commission to modify that or not, we'll have to see.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust.<br>
<b>Ali Agha</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Maria, you had mentioned that the equity ratio at SCE was 50% at the end of the year. Can you remind us what that means in dollar<br>terms in terms of the excess equity cushion you currently have there?<br>
<b>Maria C. Rigatti</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
So it's a 13-month average that we have to maintain at 48%. I am going to say round number, it's about...<br>
<b>Unidentified Company Representative</b><br>
It's more than $500 million.<br>
<b>Maria C. Rigatti</b> - Edison International - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
It's more than $500 million. I think it's around $600 million. Sorry, I was just looking at some of the math here as we answer your<br>question, Ali. It's around there. It's a little bit -- you can't tie it down to any particular number like consistently just because it's a<br>13-month average rolling calculation that we do. So it's in that ballpark.<br>
<b>Ali Agha</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
I see. Okay. And then, Pedro, as you mentioned, there are -- you have various forums and parts you're looking at trying to get some<br>clarity closure, if you will, on inverse condemnation, et cetera. Is your sense that for full clarity to come, you need the Cal Fire<br>investigation to first be complete, in their determination on causes? Is that sort of the critical part item? Or from the outside, how<br>should we be looking at and keeping track of -- to say, okay, this is a key element in some clarity on this process?<br>

<A name=331></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, EIX - Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. That's a good question. And I think my answer is<br>
[Audio gap]<br>
I was thinking about pieces, separate tracks, right? So there's a track around the Cal Fire investigation, to the Thomas fire and causation<br>per se and then what standards will be applied in terms of liability and all of that. There's this broader track around -- the state has<br>an issue. It's a big issue. Part of the issue is this -- the concern about the application of inverse condemnation feasibility, so the issue<br>is broader than that, as I mentioned earlier. And so we're really looking for a broader, statewide solution.<br>
Now clearly, there's a connection between these, right? And so if we had a very speedy resolution, and I think that would be wishing<br>for a lot because we do expect this will take time. But let's say that we have clarity up front in terms of there's a bill that gets passed<br>next month that resolves the application of inverse, well then it clearly would have some impact on -- once the Cal Fire investigation<br>concludes, that would have impact on the recourse it means we would have to get recoveries for damages.<br>
But again, I don't think that there's a serial linkage where we have to wait for that Cal Fire investigation of the Thomas fire to conclude<br>in order to work the various other paths, regulatory, legislative paths to try and resolve the broader statewide issue. I do see this as<br>fairly decoupled. Does that make sense, Ali?<br>
<b>Ali Agha</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
It does. To just on that to clarify your opening remarks as well, you talked about the California state goals, et cetera. Are you getting<br>any conversations back to suggest that there is some recognition coming that, hey, to meet our ambitious climate change and other<br>goals, this issue is directly linked and impacting that?<br>
<b>Pedro J. Pizarro</b> - Edison International - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Without getting into specifics who said what, yes, I think there is that recognition. And a lot of it is driven by the goals and the math<br>behind the goals. Let's just focus on the 40% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030. That goal alone, the state itself has looked at tools<br>like electrification of transportation, and building efficiency and renewables, requiring a strong grid, being a part of the solution, a<br>major part of the solution. I'm glad that we have completed our analysis that lead to our clean energy white paper in the fall because<br>of that, quite frankly, sharpened our thinking in terms of what it will take for the states to get there. And so that said, with the state,<br>if the state really wants to get us a 40% reduction and deliver the lowest possible cost for our customers, this is a whole lot of years<br>from the smart, modern reliable grid that's needed to get 80% carbon-free resources and get 7 million electric vehicles and get a<br>bunch of water heaters and space heaters that are electric and so on. And so I think folks recognize that, but it is helpful that we<br>have voices like the Air Resources board who put out their plans. You have the governor upping state's objective to 5 million electric<br>vehicles. We still stand by our math, which suggests that it's a cheaper path for the state. It's actually more like 7 million electric<br>vehicles. And I think, Ali, we'll see that continue to surface in various venues. One that I will point to coming up here is the integrated<br>resource planning process at the CPUC, which will use different scenarios and take a look at our long-term horizon for the resource<br>mix in California. And that I think will, once again, provide more proof points for the importance of healthy utilities.<br>

<b>PRESENTATION SUMMARY</b><br>
<b>I. 2017 BUSINESS REVIEW (M.W.)</b><br>
<b>A. Overview:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>In a year that began with a great deal of uncertainty with anticipated industry excess capacity leading to bearish module<br>
AFP projections, coupled with the challenges that came with Series 6 transition, Co. is pleased with its focus, execution and<br>ability to exceed earnings and cash flow commitments for the year.<br>
<b>2. </b>Record year with net bookings of 7.7 gigawatts DC.<br>
<b>a. </b>Series 6 represented 2.6 gigawatts DC.<br>
<b>i. </b>Contracting this business is an outstanding accomplishment and provides improved clarity to ramp and grow Series 6<br>
production over the coming years.<br>
<b>b. </b>In addition to strong bookings in US, Co. saw strength in international markets led by Australia, Japan, India and Europe<br>
where Co. booked over 1.7 gigawatts.<br>
<b>c. </b>Strong demand in China and 201 trade case in US helped to firm up the macro-environment.<br>
<b>d. </b>Collaborative approach to working with customers and the progress Co. made towards the launch Series 6 module were<br>
key contributors to achieving record bookings.<br>
<b>3. </b>O&amp;M bookings were strong as Co. added nearly 2.9 gigawatts of projects, bringing total O&amp;M fleet on a contract to 8.5<br>
gigawatts.<br>
<b>a. </b>Nearly two-thirds of megawatts booked were in projects where Co. is not the developer.<br><b>b. </b>Successfully winning O&amp;M projects not developed by Co. opens addressable market, which helps create scale for O&amp;M<br>
business and enhances Co.'s competitive position.<br>

<A name=336></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, FSLR - Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>a. </b>Relative to expectation at beginning of 2017, Co. has lowered the projected balance of system cost per watt by 20% on<br>
major projects that Co. will be constructing in 2018.<br>
<b>i. </b>This improvement is a result of lower labor costs from utilizing Series 6 modules, as well as taking a comprehensive<br>
value stream approach to driving down all aspects of BoS costs.<br>
<b>b. </b>Over 7.5 gigawatts of cumulative modules installed.<br>
<b>6. </b>As a result of strong Series 4 bookings, cost per watt improvements made and by executing on key system project sales,<br>
Co. achieved earnings adjusted for one-time impact of tax reform and restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2.59<br>per share, which is on the high-end of guidance range.<br>
<b>7. </b>With over $1.3b in operating cash flow generated and ending net cash balance of $2.6b, Co. further enhanced Co.'s<br>
industry-best balance sheet.<br>
<b>8. </b>In late 2016, when Co. announced the acceleration of Series 6 roadmap, one of the key objectives was to ensure sufficient<br>
liquidity throughout this process.<br>
<b>a. </b>Thus far, Co. is tracking extremely well against this objective as measured by net cash at 2017-end.<br><b>b. </b>Net cash position is even more significant when taking into account the fact that in 2017, Co. invested roughly $500m in<br>
Series 6 capacity, representing approx. 35% of total committed CapEx, which includes capital for a second factory in<br>Vietnam that was not in original roadmap.<br>
<b>c. </b>Still has a significant capital investment ahead.<br>
<b>d. </b>Co. is in strong financial position to execute on the roadmap.<br>
<b>C. Series 6 Manufacturing:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Ohio factory:<br>
<b>a. </b>Continued to make good progress since the last update at Analyst Day.<br><b>b. </b>Line is now fully integrated.<br>
<b>c. </b>Manufacturing modules for extensive testing and valuation is ongoing.<br>
<b>d. </b>Line performance thus far is consistent with expectations for this stage of the startup.<br>
<b>e. </b>Next major milestone is start of high-volume manufacturing, scheduled to begin in 2Q18.<br>
<b>2. </b>Malaysia:<br>
<b>a. </b>First equipment began arriving last Oct.<br><b>b. </b>Now has over 90% of front-end tools installed.<br>
<b>c. </b>Targeting first complete module in 2Q18.<br>
<b>3. </b>Vietnam:<br>
<b>a. </b>First factory is ready for tool installation.<br>
<b>i. </b>Reached a key milestone in Jan. when the coder arrived on site.<br>
<b>b. </b>Construction activities at second factory are ahead of schedule.<br>
<b>c. </b>Hiring for the factories is progressing.<br>
<b>4. </b>Overall pleased with the progress across these three subsequent Series 6 factories.<br>
<b>a. </b>Construction activities, factory readiness, tool delivery and tool install, all advancing according to plan.<br>
<b>D. Series 4:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Primary focus continues to be on maximizing Series 6 capacity.<br><b>2. </b>As a result of strong Series 4 bookings, decided to restart two lines of Series 4 production in Ohio, which were shut down<br>
in late 2017.<br>
<b>a. </b>With prior workforce having transitioned to support the new Series 6 process, Co. is currently hiring new associates to<br>
run these lines.<br>
<b>b. </b>These additional lines will provide Co. with 180 megawatts of additional volume in 2018.<br>
<b>c. </b>Whether [Co. will] continue to run these lines beyond 2018 would depend on market conditions.<br>
<b>d. </b>This incremental capacity raises Co.'s 2018 expected production to 3.1 gigawatts DC.<br>
<b>E. Bookings Since Last Earnings Call:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Had net bookings of 7.7 gigawatts DC worth shipments of 2.7 gigawatts DC for the same period.<br>

<A name=337></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, FSLR - Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>2. </b>Since the start of 2018, Co. has booked approx. 1.3 gigawatts of additional volume, bringing total future contracted business<br>
to 9.1 gigawatts DC.<br>
<b>3. </b>Including the 1.3 gigawatts of volume booked YTD, total booking since 3Q17 earnings call are now over 2.3 gigawatts DC.<br>
<b>a. </b>Development project bookings are a key component of the 2.3 gigawatts of new business signed.<br>
<b>4. </b>Leveraging Co.'s advantaged Series 6 model, Co. has signed PPAs for nearly 600 megawatts DC with both utility and corporate<br>
customers.<br>
<b>a. </b>Demand for solar power from both utility and corporate customers is expected to grow significantly in coming years.<br>
<b>i. </b>Believes that Co. is well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity and be a partner of choice for these customers.<br>
<b>5. </b>Utility customers:<br>
<b>a. </b>Signed a PPA with Georgia Power for a 200 megawatt AC project that's expected to commence construction in Nov. 2018<br>
and reach COD by late 2019.<br>
<b>i. </b>Awarded this volume as part of the 525 megawatt AC RFP for Georgia Power's renewable energy development initiative.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Upon completion, it will be one of the largest solar power plants in the southeastern US.<br>
<b>b. </b>Has signed a PPA with APS to develop and construct a 65 megawatt AC solar power plant in Arizona with a 50 megawatt<br>
AC battery capable of delivering power for more than three hours.<br>
<b>i. </b>This project is expected to be one of the largest PV plus storage (PVS) systems in US when completed in 2020.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Believes this PVS project is an industry first, demonstrating the ability of the combined technology to serve APS with a<br>
firm peaking resource, which will allow APS to meet customers' electricity demands into the evening hours.<br>
<b>c. </b>In addition to utilities contracting for solar via PPAs, Co. is also witnessing growing interest and increased approval for<br>
utility ownership for solar generation as highlighted by recent partnership with Tampa Electric Company.<br>
<b>i. </b>Co. signed a large module agreement with Tampa Electric Company last year.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Co. has now contracted with them to add EPC scope to three projects which total 250 megawatts DC.<br>
<b>iii. </b>Co. continues to discuss with them additional projects where Co. may add EPC services to current module supply<br>
agreement.<br>
<b>d. </b>As a long-term owner of solar assets, utility buyers place greater emphasis on partnering with exceptional performance<br>
track record, a reputation for quality and a strong balance sheet.<br>
<b>i. </b>Co. believes it is well positioned in this market as Co.'s strengths closely match their requirements.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Co. expects this trend toward utility ownership to continue to accelerate.<br>
<b>6. </b>C&amp;I:<br>
<b>a. </b>Signed a 150 megawatt AC PPA with a major corporate renewable customer in US.<br>
<b>i. </b>This agreement represents a significant purchase of solar power that will enable this customer to advance towards its<br>
100% renewable energy goal.<br>
<b>b. </b>Similarly to utility customers, corporate renewable buyers are not only focused on the economics and value of solar, but<br>
also heavily weigh other factors they believe give Co. an advantage with this customer group.<br>
<b>c. </b>Corporate customers are very focused on avoiding reputational risk, which means they're looking for partners with a<br>
proven track record and financial stability.<br>
<b>i. </b>In addition, they value partners with a global reach and the ability to provide turnkey solutions.<br>
<b>7. </b>Development pipeline in Australia continues to grow with signing of the Beryl project located in New South Wales.<br>
<b>a. </b>Project is expected to be completed in middle of 2019 and brings Co.'s contracted pipeline to over 100 megawatts AC in<br>
Australia.<br>
<b>b. </b>Co. continues to have a very active development portfolio in Australia with additional projects in mid-to-late stage pipeline.<br>
<b>F. Mid-to-Late Stage Bookings Opportunities:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>At 6.8 gigawatts DC, mid-to-late stage opportunities are more than triple the opportunities Co. had at this time last year.<br><b>2. </b>Since last qtr.'s earnings call, the number of opportunities increased by a net 600 megawatts DC.<br>
<b>a. </b>With bookings [a little over] 2.3 gigawatts DC during the same time period, gross total opportunities added exceeded 3<br>
gigawatts.<br>
<b>3. </b>Included in the 6.8 gigawatts opportunities are more than 1.5 gigawatts of projects that Co. has signed but due to its<br>
disciplined approach have not yet been counted as bookings.<br>
<b>a. </b>Majority of these opportunities are expected to book over the course of the year as financing and other CPs are closed.<br>

<hr>
<A name=338></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, FSLR - Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>4. </b>Mid-to-late stage pipeline provides visibility into contracting volume for the next several years.<br>
<b>a. </b>Over 4.5 gigawatts of the opportunities are for delivery in either 2020 or 2021, highlighting the time period in which Co.<br>
is discussing opportunities with customers.<br>
<b>5. </b>System projects are another important component of the mid-to-late stage opportunities and comprise over 750 megawatts<br>
DC of these potential bookings.<br>
<b>a. </b>Similar to last qtr., this list includes opportunities with US utilities, corporate customers and international projects in Japan<br>
and Australia.<br>
<b>6. </b>While not reflected as a potential booking opportunity in the 6.8 gigawatts shown, Co. is currently in discussions with various<br>
customers that have already purchased Co.'s modules to add EPC scope to nearly 900 megawatt DC of projects.<br>
<b>a. </b>These potential opportunities are in addition to the more than 250 megawatt DC already booked with Tampa Electric<br>
Company.<br>
<b>b. </b>While these EPC agreements will not be counted as bookings when signed, they will be added to Co.'s contracted future<br>
revenue and be reflected in the contracted pipeline table in 10-K and 10-Q filings.<br>
<b>7. </b>With 900 megawatts of EPC opportunities, almost 600 megawatts of new project development booking and 750 megawatts<br>
of mid-to-late stage development opportunities, Co. is encouraged by its progress and remains steadfastly focused on<br>strengthening systems pipeline.<br>
<b>G. 8point3 Transaction:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>8point3, Co.'s JV Yieldco with Sunpower, has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Capital Dynamics.<br>
<b>a. </b>This agreement follows a comprehensive multi-phase process where more than 130 parties were contracted and expressed<br>
in-bound interest.<br>
<b>2. </b>With committed acquisition financing and Capital Dynamics' proven track record of acquiring renewable projects, Co. is<br>
confident the transaction will close.<br>
<b>3. </b>Expects net proceeds from the sale of Co.'s interest in 8point3 of approx. $230m.<br>
<b>a. </b>Actual net proceeds Co. receives upon closing will depend on the day of the transaction actually closes.<br><b>b. </b>Upon closing of the transaction, $50m promissory note associated with Co.'s sale of interest in the Stateline project to<br>
8point3 will be repaid.<br>
<b>II. 4Q17 FINANCIALS (A.B.)</b><br>
<b>A. Highlights:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Note:<br>
<b>a. </b>Metrics provided are reflective of Series 4 manufacturing only.<br>
<b>2. </b>Module production increased slightly to 532 megawatts DC, 1% increase from 3Q17.<br>
<b>a. </b>Production is lower vs. 4Q16 due to ramping down certain Series 4 lines in Ohio in Malaysia to make way for Series 6<br>
production.<br>
<b>3. </b>Capacity utilization, which makes adjustments for the lines' takeout of service, was 99%.<br><b>4. </b>Fleet and best line conversion efficiency were unchanged vs. prior qtr. at 17%.<br><b>5. </b>This will be the last qtr. that Co. reports Series 4 efficiency since it will remain relatively unchanged going forward.<br><b>6. </b>In future quarters, as Series 6 enters production, Co. will modify the operational metrics to provide the most relevant<br>
information.<br>
<b>B. Income Statement Highlights:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>4Q17 net sales $339m, decrease of $748m vs. prior qtr.<br>
<b>a. </b>Expected decrease in net sales was due to both lower systems and third-party module sales.<br><b>b. </b>Systems project sales are much higher in 3Q due to the initial revenue recognition of the California Flats and Cuyama<br>
projects.<br>
<b>i. </b>For the second phase of California Flats as well as other development projects scheduled to reach COD in 2018 which<br>
are optimized with Series 6 modules, there was minimal systems activity in 4Q17.<br>

<b>c. </b>Projects such as Rosamond and Willow Springs, which are scheduled to be completed in 2018, have not yet been sold<br>
and therefore did not have any revenue recognized in 4Q17.<br>
<b>i. </b>Both of these projects are progressing well through the sale process.<br>
<b>2. </b>2017 net sales $2.94b, 1% increase vs. 2016.<br>
<b>a. </b>Relative to net sales guidance, actual sales were slightly lower due to certain project sales in India that moved into 2018.<br>
<b>i. </b>There was some uncertainty as to the timing of when these projects would be sold.<br>
<b>b. </b>While Co. closed the sales of 35 megawatts in 2017, remaining projects are now expected to be sold this year.<br>
<b>3. </b>As a percentage of total quarterly net sales, system revenue in 4Q17 was 39% vs. 72% in 3Q17.<br>
<b>a. </b>For full-year 2017, 73% of net sales from systems business vs. 77% in 2016.<br>
<b>4. </b>Has modified segment reporting in order to better align with Co.'s internal analysis of the business and also to reflect the<br>
expected increase in third-party module sales as Co. ramps manufacturing capacity in the coming years.<br>
<b>a. </b>Module segment now includes only module sales to third parties and the systems segment will include all revenue from<br>
the sale of solar power systems including the module.<br>
<b>b. </b>Changes to segment reporting will be fully reflected in 10-K.<br>
<b>5. </b>4Q17 GM decreased to 18% from 27% in 3Q17, primarily due to lower gross profit projects realized.<br>
<b>a. </b>Full-year GM 19%.<br>
<b>6. </b>4Q17 adjusted OpEx, which exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges, was $99m.<br>
<b>a. </b>Increase of $15m vs. 3Q17.<br><b>b. </b>More than half of the increase was due to higher production startup as Series 6 activities accelerated.<br>
<b>7. </b>2017 adjusted OpEx $334m, in line with guidance.<br><b>8. </b>Combined SG&amp;A and R&amp;D expense decrease by 25% vs. 2016 despite higher variable compensation in 4Q17.<br>
<b>a. </b>This reduction of $95m is a significant one-year reduction and demonstrates the positive impact of Co.'s focused<br>
restructuring efforts.<br>
<b>9. </b>Excluding restructuring and asset impairments, had an adjusted operating loss of $37m in 4Q17 vs. adjusted operating<br>
profit of $208m in 3Q17.<br>
<b>a. </b>Decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily due to lower that sales and higher production startup expenses.<br>
<b>10. </b>Fully-year 2017 adjusted operating income $215m.<br>
<b>C. Impact of US Tax Reform Legislation:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Signed into law in Dec. 2017.<br><b>2. </b>New tax law, amongst other changes:<br>
<b>a. </b>Lowered the statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.<br><b>b. </b>Imposed a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.<br>
<b>c. </b>Introduced new tax regime.<br>
<b>d. </b>Changed Co.'s foreign [earnings subject] to US tax.<br>
<b>3. </b>Given the scope of Co.'s operations across module manufacturing, project development, EPC and O&amp;M services, and the<br>
global reach of Co.'s business operating across the Americas, EMEA, India and Asia-Pacific, the impact of tax reform on FSLR<br>is both complex and varied.<br>
<b>4. </b>Strategically Co. believes the impact of tax reform would be a net positive for Co.<br><b>5. </b>Co. may see some short-term impact to the US project development and financing markets as capital structures and sources<br>
adapt to the new tax regime.<br>
<b>6. </b>Continues to evaluate the impact of the new international tax structures on Co.'s international manufacturing and sales<br>
businesses.<br>
<b>7. </b>Expects the lower corporate tax rate and immediate expensing of qualified equipment to be beneficial to Co.'s existing US<br>
manufacturing base, as well as importantly making the option of adding additional US manufacturing capacity more<br>attractive as Co. looks to scale the module manufacturing business.<br>
<b>8. </b>Specific to 2017 reported financials and 2018 guidance, due to the complexity and recent implementation of the tax reform,<br>
Co. continues to evaluate its impact.<br>
<b>9. </b>Provisional amounts that Co. has accorded will require additional analysis further interpretation and guidance from<br>
government regulators.<br>

<b>a. </b>This means that Co. expects to continue revising Co.'s provisional estimates until Co. files 2017 federal return later this<br>
year.<br>
<b>b. </b>2018 guidance has also been updated to reflect Co.'s provisional view of the impact of tax reform.<br>
<b>c. </b>In both cases, final resulting financial impact of this tax reform may differ materially from Co.'s current estimates.<br>
<b>D. Tax Expense:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>In 4Q17, Co. recorded a provisional tax expense of $408m, which included $401.5m charge on the accumulated earnings<br>
of foreign subsidiaries and net deferred tax expense of $6.6m for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities<br>at the lower US corporate income tax rate of 21%.<br>
<b>a. </b>These items were offset by a tax benefit in the qtr., bringing the total expense in 4Q17 to $399m.<br>
<b>2. </b>Cash impact of tax reform is expected to be much lower than the P&amp;L impact.<br><b>3. </b>By utilizing existing tax credits, Co. estimates its cash payment will be approx. $101m.<br>
<b>a. </b>Plans to pay this amount over the full eight-year period allowed.<br>
<b>E. EPS:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>As a result of the higher tax charge, lower revenue and higher production startup expenses, 4Q17 GAAP loss per share was<br>
$4.14 vs. GAAP EPS of $1.95 in 3Q17.<br>
<b>2. </b>Full-year 2017 GAAP loss per share was $1.59.<br><b>3. </b>After adjusting for tax reform impacts and the effects of restructuring and asset impairment charges, non-GAAP loss per<br>
share was $0.25 in 4Q17.<br>
<b>4. </b>Full-year 2017 non-GAAP EPS was $2.59.<br>
<b>a. </b>Near the high-end of guidance range even without including the international projects mentioned earlier that moved<br>
into 2018.<br>
<b>F. Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Cash and marketable securities balance at year-end was nearly $3b.<br>
<b>a. </b>Increase of $270m from prior qtr.<br>
<b>2. </b>Net cash position increased by $220m to nearly $2.6b.<br><b>3. </b>Increase in cash balance is primarily related to cash received from projects sold in the prior qtr. and third-party module<br>
sales.<br>
<b>4. </b>Year-ended net cash balance of $2.6b was higher than guidance expectations of $2.3b as a result of lower development<br>
spending on certain projects due to timing, higher advanced module payments, favorable timing of collecting project<br>receipts, and working capital changes, partially offset by slightly higher CapEx.<br>
<b>5. </b>Net working capital in 4Q17, which includes the change in non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable<br>
securities, decreased by $457m.<br>
<b>a. </b>Change was primarily due to a decrease in AR from module and systems collections, including final payments on the<br>
Switch and Cuyama projects.<br>
<b>6. </b>Total debt at 4Q17-end was $394m.<br>
<b>a. </b>Increase of $50m from the prior qtr.<br><b>b. </b>Increases resulted from issuing project-level debt to fund ongoing project construction in Japan and Australia.<br>
<b>c. </b>Essentially all of outstanding debt is project related and will come off the balance sheet when the projects are sold.<br>
<b>7. </b>Cash flows from operations in 4Q17 were $434m, primarily as a result of payments from system project.<br>
<b>a. </b>Operating cash flow in prior qtr. was $581m.<br>
<b>8. </b>Full-year 2017 cash flows from operations were $1.34b, which exceeded the high-end of guidance expectations.<br>
<b>a. </b>Operating cash flows [was strong for the year] as a result of the same items that positively impacted net cash.<br>
<b>9. </b>4Q17 CapEx was $199m vs. $98m in the prior qtr. as spending on Series 6 increased.<br>
<b>10. </b>Full-year CapEx was $514m, vast majority of which was invested in Series 6 capacity expansion.<br>
<b>G. Updated 2018 Guidance:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>With Series 6 production planned to commence in 2Q18 and ramp significantly in 2H18, Co. has always anticipated the<br>
1H18 would be the trough in Co.'s earnings profile.<br>

<b>a. </b>Startup expense is weighted towards 1H18.<br><b>b. </b>Timing of project sales and systems revenue recognition further magnify the 1H vs. 2H difference.<br>
<b>c. </b>[Second half] of California Flats as well as the Rosamond and Willow Springs projects will utilize Series 6 modules, which<br>
pushes more revenue and profit recognition into 2H18.<br>
<b>d. </b>Forecasted sale of projects in Japan is also expected to take place later in the year.<br>
<b>2. </b>Expects approx. 25% of full-year earnings to be recognized in 1H18 with 2Q18 expected to be stronger than 1Q18.<br><b>3. </b>Depending on the timing of US and India project sales between 1Q18 one in 2Q18, there is a potential for a loss in 1Q18.<br><b>4. </b>Raising net sales guidance by $150m to revised range of $2.45-2.65b.<br>
<b>a. </b>Increase is a result of both the timing of the India project sales that Co. now expects to close in 2018, as well as the increase<br>
in Series 4 production in Ohio.<br>
<b>5. </b>GM guidance has been revised down by 50 BP to 21.5-22.5%, resulting from the updated mix of revenue.<br><b>6. </b>OpEx expenses remain unchanged from prior expectations.<br><b>7. </b>As a result of the higher revenue, Co. is increasing the midpoint of operating income guidance by $15m.<br><b>8. </b>There are certain updates below operating income that have a largely offsetting impact.<br>
<b>a. </b>Increased in estimated tax expense by approx. $20m.<br>
<b>i. </b>Approx. 30% of increase is a result of the new tax reform legislation with the remaining impact from revisions to forecasts.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Has updated guidance based on provisional view of tax reform impact and the final impact could differ from current<br>
estimate.<br>
<b>b. </b>More than offsetting the increase in tax expense is higher equity in earnings from the pending sale of 8point3, which was<br>
previously not included in guide.<br>
<b>9. </b>Combining the updates to net sales, tax and equity in earnings forecasts, leads to revised EPS range of $1.50-1.90.<br>

<A name=342></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, FSLR - Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Brian Lee</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - VP and Senior Clean Energy Analyst<br>
Just maybe first one for you, Mark. I thought the commentary around the development project pipeline, it sounds like it's seeing<br>some better momentum. So do you still see the 1 gigawatt baseline being the right target for 2018 and maybe more importantly<br>for 2019? Or should we be expecting some upside to that level at this point?<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
Brian, the way I look at it, let's hold kind of the gigawatt view at this point in time. We internally are continuing to pursue all<br>opportunities that we can at enhancing the systems pipeline whether it's development PPAs, whether it's utility-owned generation,<br>whether it's working with large C&amp;I customers, I'm happy with the momentum that we're seeing right now. We're also starting to<br>see the announcement we had with APS and the PV-plus-storage. We're seeing a lot more of that opportunity in the marketplace<br>right now. So I think there's a tremendous amount of momentum moving in that direction that we're very well positioned and we<br>have a pretty robust pipeline of projects that we're pursuing. I think we're divesting to do this right now as while we may be (inaudible)<br>to move above that number over the horizon. I think let's stay at the 1 gigawatt, and we'll continue to update you on our progress<br>as we move forward.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll take our next question from Philip Shen with Roth Capital Partners.<br>
<b>Philip Lee-Wei Shen</b> - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst<br>
First one here is on ASPs. We've heard some chatter that you may be trying to increase ASPs on existing bookings post 201. Your<br>module pricing is up incrementally following the tariffs. Do you have any wiggle room in your contracts to increase your ASPs for<br>your 7.7 gigawatts of bookings through year-end '17? Or are they locked in? And also, does your 1.3 gigs in 2018 year-to-date reflect<br>any of the higher pricing that the market has experienced? Secondarily, we're also hearing that there may be some additional Series<br>6 capacity coming available for customers. Is this primarily due to the additional Vietnam facility you talked about in December? Or<br>are you contemplating yet another capacity expansion? I know you have a lot in your plate with launching 5 facilities over 3 years,<br>but what would it take to add yet another gigawatt of capacity sometime in the next couple of years? Is that even realistic?<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
Yes. So on the ASP, I'll start with that first, Phil. I mean, again, the way we structured our contracts, that 7.7 gigawatt that you referenced,<br>they were firm, typically enforceable obligations between both counterparties. So those ASPs were firm fixed price ASPs in both<br>directions, so there is no room to move relative to that. And we're very happy with how we contracted that volume. So it's always<br>one of those things you could look back in hindsight and say should you have done anything differently. I'm very happy with what<br>we did. I think we did everything we should have and we did the right thing and best positioned us not only to best serve the needs<br>of our customers but to enable the company and continue to grow. As it relates to the 1.3 gigawatts that we booked since the<br>beginning of the year, I mean, clearly, the business that has not been booked in the 1.3 is a carryforward as we started beginning of<br>this year with the clarity around the 201 case. We engaged the market and we get market prices at that point in time. So is there<br>room potentially around Series 6 in particular to get maybe slightly better ASPs than we would have recognized previously and then<br>the 7.7 gigawatts or I guess the 2.6 that we booked to Series 6 last year? Clearly, there's always that opportunity. But it's -- again, it's<br>a balanced take around how we engage with our customers from that perspective. But it's always we want to make sure that we're<br>giving them the best quality, the best technology, enable them to be successful and to make sure we're getting the fair value for<br>the technology that we're providing. As it relates to the Series 6 capacity, we -- there are no firm commitment to this point in time<br>to do anything but what we've already indicated during our Analyst Day. Now what I will say, though, and Alex alluded to this a little<br>

bit in his remarks, as we look at the tax reform and what's happening now with the U.S. corporate tax rate when you look at the<br>media expensing, there's optionality potentially or there are scenarios like -- or maybe it's a better we to say that we would look to<br>-- in the U.S. to have additional manufacturing as part of our overall scenario analysis across the global production platform, looking<br>at the U.S. as a different lens that it would have otherwise before tax reform. And there is some capability that potentially says that<br>we could get -- if we made a decision to produce in the U.S. could we get some additional capacity between now and, say, the 2020<br>or 20 -- beginning of 2020 time frame. Can we get a little bit more capacity? Potentially. It depends on how things play out. At this<br>scenario, we're going to continue to evaluate, no commitment at this point in time. But it wouldn't be in order of magnitude of 1<br>gigawatt. We're talking a few hundred megawatts or so from that perspective. Nothing around Series 6 that would capture 1 gigawatt<br>of upside over, say, the next 2 years or so.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we will take our next question from Paul Coster with JPMorgan.<br>
<b>Mark Wesley Strouse</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Alternative Energy and Applied and Emerging Technologies<br>Analyst<br>
This Mark Strouse on for Paul. So regarding the revised revenue outlook for 2018, can you provide a little bit more color how much<br>of that was driven by the timing of the international projects versus the Section 201, the increase in Series 4 production?<br>
<b>Alexander R. Bradley</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CFO<br>
Yes. Mark, so the increase is probably about $150 million rollover from the India assets. So you're going to see a relatively small piece<br>coming from the -- again, relatively small added capacity that we're putting on into various firms, the majority coming from the<br>rollover of those Indian assets.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll take our next question from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.<br>
<b>Colin William Rusch</b> - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst<br>
Can you clarify how much of the bookings happened after the 201 decision was laid out? And then also if you could give us an update<br>on where we're at in terms of the historical storage solutions that you've been working on and working with partners on.<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
So I mean, if you think about the actual -- I guess the president made his final decision, and 201 was at the end of January. So I guess<br>if you look at the time line, we're about a month -- less than a month I guess from when that actual final decision was made. We had<br>a significant amount of momentum going into the bookings. Even before the announcement from -- the final decision. Now clearly<br>there was indication of potential impact around 201 case. Tariffs were being proposed by the commissioners to the president. So<br>there has been indications in the marketplace -- stronger indications as we progress to the second half of '17 clearly. And we've --<br>as we indicated as well, even in our mid- to late-stage pipeline, I mean, we've got over 1 gigawatt of basically negotiated volume<br>that sits within that pipeline just (inaudible). So what I would say is as you look at the profile of the bookings as they evolve, let's say<br>from the middle of '17 through today as well as plus what's in our mid- to late-stage pipeline as we continue to move across that<br>continuum, clearly, the indication of the overhang or the concern, I guess, maybe it's a better way to say it, of the impact of 201<br>

continue to increase over that horizon. But the other thing I want to make sure it's clear is we said this before. We have engaged our<br>customers and we've done this in a risk-sharing approach, and we have not tried to do anything that would be opportunistic or to<br>create some form of windfall benefit to First Solar. And we look at this overall industry as having tremendous growth and potential.<br>It is a marathon. It is not a sprint. We want to have long-term relationships with our customers. We'll treat them fairly and we'll<br>continue to give them the best technology in the industry and provide the best power plant solutions and maintaining those power<br>plant solutions over their anticipated life cycle. So that's how we're thinking about kind of our customer engagement model and<br>not to try to do something that would be short-term opportunistic to adversely impact our long-term relationships.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll take our next question from...<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
I'm sorry. I think there was one other question on PVS. I'm sorry, I just want to make sure I got that one as well. Look, I think the deal<br>that we've done with APS, I think it's unique in the fact that -- and different than anything else that has been done so far. The PPA<br>with APS is for 100% of the battery components of the energy generation. It's all for power that are being delivered in the early<br>evening hours. It was part of an all resource RFP, where we competed head-to-head with mainly gas figures. They were looking for<br>generation that was going to be dispatched in the, call it, the 3 to 8 or even after 8:00 p.m. type of window. So we're generating the<br>PV during the day. We're storing the energy in the batteries and then we're dispatching it at a point in time of when there's the<br>greatest need for that energy in the evening hours. And so that's creating a completely different value proposition and kind of is<br>changing the game around what are the fundamental economics of solar. It's not just looking at power generation during the middle<br>of the day. It's saying what can we do to create -- enhance value by having truly reliable, dispatchable, controllable solar in the<br>evening hours. So it's -- I think that more and more utilities will continue to evaluate what we've done there. I think you'll see more<br>and more momentum. We are continuing to see a tremendous amount of interest from our customers around thinking about storage.<br>And whether it sits today as part of the power plant or to look at the long-term optionality around how to integrate storage at some<br>future date, that creates optionality that they may want to take advantage of in the future especially in markets where the solar<br>penetration is much lower than it is, say, in California or even here in Arizona. But it's those types of kind of forward-looking and<br>thought leadership kind of value propositions that we're able to create with our customers. And I think there will be a lot of interest<br>and people wanting to learn more about what we've done with APS, and we're already getting some inquiries from customers.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll take our next question from Jeff Osborne with Cowen and Company.<br>
<b>Jeffrey David Osborne</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
A two-part question. So I think at the Analyst Day, you talked about 13.75 gigawatts of cumulative shipments between '18 and '20.<br>I guess you've got 9.1 gigawatts of that booked now. Where does that go with the Ohio decision that you made? And then also I<br>think it was in the -- buried in the footnotes, but can you just touch on the 700 megawatts of de-bookings that you saw during the<br>year?<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
Yes. So right now, the way I would look at the -- if you look at the decision that we're going to continue to run 2 lines in Perrysburg,<br>at this point in time, think of it as a commitment for this year. So there's another, call it, a couple of hundred megawatts that we<br>

would -- in the supply plan relative to what we would have said in the Analyst Day. We will continue to evaluate that production as<br>we exit this year, do so we continue to run it into '19, do we carry it into '20? If we did it across all 3 years, then you're talking in the<br>range of about 600 megawatts if we chose to do that. So that's -- if you think of it right now 200 megawatts, that's what we're<br>committing to. We'll continue to evaluate when we make a decision to run that production longer than that. And relative to the 700<br>of de-bookings, the largest one that we had during the year was a project which went by a couple of different names, either Tribal<br>Solar or Fort Mojave depending on -- I'm not sure exactly what we -- how we called it in our SEC filings. So that was a PPA that we<br>had with California utility. And because of various reasons, the viability around that project, we ended up terminating that PPA. So<br>that was the picture. Then there was a handful of module agreements that we entered into, almost framework agreements that as<br>we looked at the viability of those framework agreements relative to incremental demand that we were seeing in the marketplace<br>for our Series 4 product, there was an agreement between both parties that we terminated those framework agreements. So that's<br>really what makes up that -- the de-bookings that we highlighted in the footnote.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we will take our next question from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.<br>
<b>Vishal B. Shah</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst<br>
Mark, can you maybe talk about the margin guidance? Is it just Series 4? Or is it something else that's driving the margin outlook for<br>this year? And also relative to the 201 case announcement, have you seen any change in pricing for your products? Have prices gone<br>down or up relative to what you guys were looking at late, late last year? And then as far as the 8point3 announcement goes, you<br>guys at the time made some comments around a challenging outlook for the utility scale power market just in terms of the fall of<br>pricing, et cetera. So what's your sense of how the margins in the utility scale market are looking right now relative to -- with the<br>time of the Analyst Day?<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
Yes, let me -- I'll answer the 201 and then Alex can take the question on margin and 8point3. One thing that I want to go back to,<br>the one question around the de-bookings. I want to make sure that it's clear that those de-bookings were bookings that we had on<br>our backlog. Actually in one case, those bookings came in I think in 2015 -- the Tribal Solar I think was around 2015. The other<br>framework agreements were 2016, okay? They had nothing to do with any of the contracts that we have entered into in 2017. So as<br>we've made comments that those are firm, enforceable obligations with penalties, liquidation damages associated, these de-bookings<br>had nothing to do with that because I know we continue to get asked the question are these truly enforceable contracts. And I don't<br>want the conclusion to be it's all de-bookings. No, this is an indication those truly were not enforceable contracts. Nothing there<br>was de-booked. Anything to do with anything we recognized in 2017, these were all much older contracts from that standpoint. As<br>it relates to the 201 case, Vishal, we've -- as I tried to indicate before, we're trying to find a way that we can find a win-win for our<br>customers. We want to make sure that their projects are viable, that we're getting fair value for the technology. It also allows us to<br>be somewhat selective with who we choose to engage with in a highly creditworthy type of counterparties and others. So we can<br>be more selective from that perspective and giving the best technology that enables their business model which, obviously, enables<br>ours as well in the other things. We're booking, as we indicated. But if you look at the mid- to late-stage pipeline, our bookings profile<br>dips out in 2020 and really almost towards the end of 2020 and even in 2021. Those are somewhat uncharted territory for us. So for<br>me to tell you what that pricing looks like relative to before and after the 201, it's hard for me to give you a line of sight for that<br>because that momentum has only started to happen over, I would say, the last quarter or so. So you can't really indicate movement<br>one way or the other because we're largely sold out through '18, '19 and the first half of 2020 right now. So our bookings opportunities<br>are that much further out in the horizon. What I'll tell you is that when I look at those -- on the ASPs that are out there, relative to our<br>road map of Series 6 and where we're going with that technology, I'm pleased. I think it lines up with all of our expectations in that<br>regard. So I'll let Alex answer the other 2.<br>

<b>Alexander R. Bradley</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CFO<br>
Yes. So Vishal, regarding the margins, I mean, the margin profile that we gave at our Analyst Day I think still holds. So what you're<br>seeing is perhaps a slight increase in margin, but this here is a function of some of the systems projects that we have. We're still<br>pleased where the margins are in Series 4 products, which are in line with what we guided to in December. Around 8point3 and the<br>challenging outlook potentially at that utility scale market, I'd say, look, as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, we ran a very<br>comprehensive process. Over 130 potential buyers were contacted. And while we clearly would have liked to have got to a better<br>outcome in terms of price, we do believe it's the best deal out there in the market. But it's a little bit different from how we look at<br>future utility scale deals. So there's a bit of a difference in that situation. At the time we were out marketing 8point3, you had -- NRG<br>yield was also in the market, which added a little bit in terms of a less competitive situation. You'd always rather have less assets<br>rather than more in the market at the same time. We also had the Southern Company that owned the majority interest in a lot of<br>the projects in 8point3 were out marketing a piece of their broader solar portfolio at the same time. 8point3 has minority ownership<br>in some of the projects, and therefore, that's different to buyer who can purchase a new project outright and have a controlling<br>interest. You also have a mix of utility scale as well as there's resi and C&amp;I projects in that portfolio. The capital structure of 8point3<br>today had non-amortizing debt, so that would have to be replaced in time in amortizing as you sold that portfolio. The asset level<br>structures were already in place around the tax equities. There's less flexibility for a new buyer there, and there's also some less<br>flexibility of optimizing other value streams to buyers around O&amp;M for instance.<br>
<b>Alexander R. Bradley</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CFO<br>
When I think about the result of 8point3 relative to I think about the viability of the ongoing utility scale business, I think there are<br>clearly some differences there which give me comfort that although clearly, we preferred a higher number on 8point3 relative to<br>where we ended up, it doesn't give me significant doubts around our ability to successfully monetize our existing utility scale portfolio<br>at the margins that we've guided to.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we will take our last question from David Katter with Baird.<br>
<b>Tyler Charles Frank</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Associate<br>
This is Tyler Frank. I was hoping you can discuss how would you think about margins over the longer term. Having -- since you have<br>the contracts already locked in and I assume prices, and if things go to plan with the cost road map, should we expect margin<br>expansion (inaudible) '19 and 2020, if that's all the information you have today?<br>
<b>Mark R. Widmar</b> - First Solar, Inc. - CEO and Director<br>
Yes. So there's -- Tyler, there's a lot of moving pieces in there and I'm not give you kind of a margin range. But what I'll say is look, as<br>we move forward, when we transition everything into Series 6 as an example, we've eliminated the form factor delta and the higher<br>BoS cost, right? So now we've got a product that is a form factor equivalent and BoS neutral, right, potentially advantaged depending<br>on the application and with an energy yield advantage. So that creates a tremendously competitive product that as we move from<br>4 into 6 would give us opportunity to see gross margin expansion. There's no doubt about that. In terms of what does that profile<br>look like, there's still way too many to moving pieces at this point in time to represent that. But the other thing I want to make sure,<br>and we've highlighted this in the Analyst Day is the -- if you're talking gross margin versus op margin, I think op margin. And if we<br>can manage to scale against our fixed cost structure, we're going to see very strong contribution margin leveraged against a fixed<br>cost structure through OpEx that's going to drive op margin expansion. So growth and scale will be more impactful as it relates to<br>

op margin expansion per se than just the transition from 4 to 6 and whether or not where my ASP versus cost entitlement is around<br>Series 6. That's going to be a critical enabler but equally if not -- and like I said, probably more importantly, it's going to be our ability<br>to scale against our fixed cost to drive op margin expansion.<br>

<A name=350></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:30PM, BRC - Q2 2018 Brady Corp Earnings Call<br>
Total sales growth was 7.4% in the quarter, which was made up of 3.2% organic growth and an increase of 4.2% from foreign currency. These<br>positive trends are direct results of the focus and dedication of the entire Brady team on the execution of our strategy.<br>
This is Brady's strongest quarter of organic sales growth since the first quarter of fiscal 2012, which was 25 quarters ago. As we've stated previously,<br>our first priority was to strengthen the foundation of our business to improve profitability and cash flow in order to invest more significantly in<br>R&amp;D to generate sustained, long-term sales growth.<br>
Having turned our overall business around from negative growth to flat and now to growth above U.S. GDP rates, we are now pushing to make<br>sure that we drive consistent and strong profitable growth.<br>
Our priorities remain the same, which are to develop high-quality innovative products, to serve our customers extremely well, to drive efficiencies<br>throughout our manufacturing facilities and to streamline our SG&amp;A structure. Maintaining focus on these key priorities is working as this quarter<br>marks 2.5 straight years of year-on-year pretax profit growth.<br>
We've made a great deal of progress on operating efficiencies, and we continue to identify new opportunities from our manufacturing facilities to<br>our back-office activities. We are building momentum as an entire organization.<br>
We continue to invest in research and development, for our expenses were up another 19% this quarter. I'm really excited about the work we're<br>doing in R&amp;D. We have a team of creative engineers, who in conjunction with our product management team, sales force and most importantly,<br>our customers, are constantly challenging themselves to develop better solutions for our end users.<br>
Our Identification Solutions business continues to be strong, posting its third consecutive quarter of organic sales growth. We're growing in all 3<br>regions, and we're gaining positive momentum throughout this business. Although the health care segment of this business is still challenging,<br>this portion of the business is expected to improve in the second half of the year.<br>
The team is executing extremely well, capturing new sales opportunities and ensuring that we're providing the highest level of customer service.<br>
Our Workplace Safety business reported a strong profit improvement of 16.4% compared to the second quarter of last year. Our European WPS<br>business continues to be leading this division's results. This leadership team is effective and efficient and consistently drives our strategy and<br>delivers organic sales and profit growth.<br>
Pricing pressures continue to be a challenge, primarily in the WPS business in the Americas, and we don't expect that to change anytime soon.<br>We're addressing these challenges by providing additional value to our customers with our industry-leading safety and compliance expertise by<br>offering customized and proprietary products in Identification and Workplace Safety spaces by delivering excellent customer service, by improving<br>our customer experience through advanced digital platforms and by upgrading our manufacturing capabilities. This strategy and our approach<br>of providing significant value to our customers has been working as our turnaround of the WPS business is progressing. This quarter's profit and<br>sales improvement is an important milestone in our turnaround.<br>
We remain focused on the long term by taking action today that will result in sustained process improvement. Our focus for this fiscal year is<br>consistent, which is to continue to serve our customers, drive efficiency through every function of our business and improve our underperforming<br>businesses. We're driving organic sales growth every single day, and we believe we're making the right investments today to deliver consistent<br>organic sales growth in both of our divisions.<br>
The results of our efforts is the achievement of our financial goals and delivering long-term value to our shareholders. And I'm proud to report 2.5<br>years of quarterly profit improvement.<br>
Now I'll turn the call over to Aaron to discuss our financial results for the second quarter, then I'll be back to provide specific commentary about<br>our Identification Solutions and Workplace Safety businesses. Aaron?<br>

<A name=351></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:30PM, BRC - Q2 2018 Brady Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Aaron James Pearce</b> - Brady Corporation - CFO &amp; Treasurer<br>
Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. The financial review starts on Slide #3.<br>
Sales increased 7.4% to $287.8 million in the second quarter, which consisted of organic sales growth of 3.2% and an increase of 4.2% from foreign<br>currency translation.<br>
We remain committed to R&amp;D, and this quarter, we once again increased our investments in new product development. R&amp;D expense was $11.3<br>million, which is an increase of 19.3% over the second quarter of last year.<br>
We continued our trend of increased earnings this quarter, as pretax earnings were up 20.4% to $35 million compared to $29.1 million in last year's<br>second quarter.<br>
This profit improvement was primarily driven by organic sales growth in IDS and profitability improvements in both our IDS and WPS businesses,<br>along with our constant focus on driving efficiencies throughout our G&amp;A structure.<br>
Net earnings finished at $4.3 million this quarter compared to $25.3 million last year. In last year's second quarter, we benefited from a<br>lower-than-normal income tax rate of 13%, which was caused by certain onetime tax benefits from a large cash repatriation. This year, we recognized<br>additional tax expense of $21.1 million or approximately $0.40 of EPS as a result of the U.S. tax legislation that was enacted in December. Without<br>this tax charge, our EPS would have been $0.48 this quarter.<br>
Lastly, cash flow from operating activities was $7.7 million this quarter compared to $19.3 million in last year's second quarter, and free cash flow<br>was $3 million this quarter compared to $16 million in last year's second quarter.<br>
Slide #4 details our quarterly sales trends. Again, total sales grew 7.4% and organic sales grew 3.2% versus the second quarter of last year. This<br>quarter marks our third consecutive quarter of total company organic sales growth. We're gaining momentum, and we're focused on executing<br>our strategy to continue this trend of growth for the rest of the fiscal year.<br>
On Slide #5, you'll find an overview of our gross profit margin trending. Our gross profit margin was 49.9% this quarter, which is a decrease of 20<br>basis points compared to last year's gross profit margin of 50.1%.<br>
We're continuing to identify and execute efficiency opportunities throughout our global operations, which is effectively offsetting pricing challenges<br>in certain product categories.<br>
Moving along to Slide #6, you'll find our SG&amp;A expense trending. SG&amp;A was $97.6 million this quarter compared to $94.7 million in the second<br>quarter of last year. This increase was entirely due to foreign currency translation. In fact, in constant currencies, our SG&amp;A expense was down<br>approximately $1 million or 1%.<br>
We remain focused on improving our processes and driving our waste throughout our SG&amp;A structure. We're reinvesting a portion of these savings<br>back into direct sales and marketing resources that will help drive future sales, while the remainder of the efficiency gains are helping deliver<br>accelerated bottom line growth.<br>
Slide #7 details our increased investment in R&amp;D. We've increased our R&amp;D expenditures both in absolute dollars and as a percent of sales again<br>this quarter. Our commitment to growing organic sales over the long term involves a steady introduction of highly innovative proprietary products.<br>We believe that investing back in Brady to the development of innovative new products that add significant value to our customers are the<br>investments that will have the highest rate of return and are essential to our long-term success.<br>
R&amp;D expense was up 19.3% this quarter, and we expect this trend to continue with our full fiscal year 2018 expense expected to be up approximately<br>15% when compared to last year.<br>

<hr>
<A name=352></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:30PM, BRC - Q2 2018 Brady Corp Earnings Call<br>
Turning to Slide #8, you'll see the trending of our earnings per share and our net earnings. As I mentioned, our results were significantly impacted<br>by tax reform that was enacted during the quarter, which reduced diluted EPS by approximately $0.40.<br>
In last year's second quarter, we realized a lower-than-normal tax rate of 13%, primarily from a cash repatriation of over $125 million to the U.S.<br>This transaction benefited our diluted EPS by $0.09 last year. So if you exclude the 2 tax-related items, our EPS would have been $0.48 this quarter<br>compared to $0.40 in last year's second quarter.<br>
To move beyond the noise in our tax rate and see Brady's true earning trends that makes much more sense to look at earnings before income tax,<br>which is the chart in the lower left-hand corner of this page, specifically, you can see that our pretax earnings have shown an impressive run as<br>well, with our streak of year-over-year pretax earnings growth reaching 10 quarters, with growth of 20.4% this quarter, all of which while increasing<br>our investments in R&amp;D.<br>
This brings us to Slide #9, which provides a summary of our cash generation. We generated $7.7 million of cash flow from operating activities this<br>quarter compared to $19.3 million in last year's second quarter.<br>
Contributing to the lower free cash flow this quarter was a slight increase in CapEx, combined with cash outflows for the payments of our annual<br>incentive-based compensation and an increase in accounts receivable as a result of our stronger organic sales this quarter.<br>
Looking at this chart, you can see the cash flow from operating activities typically runs well above net earnings, and we expect this to continue<br>into the future. We consistently approach every decision with a cash-focused mindset and expect to continue generating free cash flow in excess<br>of net earnings over the long term.<br>
Moving along to Slide #10, you'll find the trending of our net cash position as well as a summary of our debt structure at the end of the quarter. At<br>January 31, we were in a net cash position of $44.1 million compared to a net debt position of $37.7 million at this time last year. This is an<br>improvement of over $80 million in the last 12 months.<br>
As we look at deploying our cash, our approach to capital allocation is disciplined and patient. First, we use our cash to fund organic growth<br>opportunities throughout the cycle, which includes funding investments in new product development, IT improvements, capability enhancing<br>capital expenditures, et cetera.<br>
Second, we focus on returning cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends, which we've consistently increased every year since going public.<br>
After funding organic growth investments and dividends, we then patiently deploy our cash in a disciplined manner for acquisitions where we<br>believe we have strong synergistic opportunities. And we use our cash to improve shareholder returns through opportunistic share repurchases.<br>
At January 31, 2018, we had 2 million shares authorized for purchase. Overall, our cash generation has been strong, our balance sheet is strong,<br>and we're focused on driving long-term value to our shareholders through our disciplined allocation of capital.<br>
Before getting to our updated guidance, let me provide some comments on our income tax rate and what we expect the impact of the new U.S.<br>tax legislation to be on our future financials, which is outlined on Slide #11.<br>
In total, we took a noncash tax charge of $21.1 million this quarter. The key phrase is that these are noncash charges for Brady. Although the<br>legislation is quite complicated and there are numerous items that will impact our future tax rates, there are 3 main items to point out.<br>
First, a major part of the U.S. tax bill passed in December is a onetime tax on deemed repatriations. Brady's cash outlay from this provision is expected<br>to be 0. Again, we won't have any out-of-pocket cash or expense from this provision.<br>
Second, we need to revalue our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and our current earnings to reflect the new lower U.S. tax rates.<br>

<hr>
<A name=353></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:30PM, BRC - Q2 2018 Brady Corp Earnings Call<br>
And third, we need to assess the recoverability of the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our foreign tax credit carryforwards.<br>
The summary of the impact of all of these items, along with the reassessment of our search in related to permanently invested foreign earnings,<br>makes up our tax charge of $21.1 million.<br>
As we look at our future tax rates, there are also a few items to point out. First, the way that the tax bill was written is such that there are certain<br>aspects that could phase in for a non-calendar year-end company such as Brady. This includes the reduction in tax rates.<br>
As such, our U.S. federal tax rate this year will drop from the statutory rate of 35% to 26.9%. Then, on August 1, 2018, our U.S. federal tax rate will<br>further drop to the headline rate of 21%.<br>
The impacts of this rate reduction and the provisional expense that we booked this quarter may also require further refinance to our tax expense<br>later this fiscal year. Also, there are numerous pieces of tax legislation that don't become effective for Brady until August 1, 2018.<br>
As such, the tax rate that we'll see in our third and fourth quarters of this year will not necessarily be indicative of our ongoing future tax rates.<br>
Excluding the impact of the tax charges recorded this quarter and any further noncash adjustments in Q3 or Q4 related to this legislation, we expect<br>that our tax rate will be approximately 27% to 29% for the full year ending July 31, 2018. And then, beyond this fiscal year, we expect that our<br>longer-term tax rates will decline from our historical ranges of 27% to 29% to a new range of 25% to 27%.<br>
Slide #12 summarizes our guidance for the full fiscal year ending July 31, 2018. We're updating our full year diluted EPS guidance range from our<br>current range of $1.85 to $1.95 to our new fiscal 2018 guidance range of $1.90 to $2 per share, exclusive of the tax charge that I just mentioned.<br>
Our increased guidance is a result of 2 primary factors. First, is to reflect our stronger operating results, as our organic sales have improved and we<br>continue to make strides in driving efficiencies throughout our business. Embedded in these improved operating results are further increases in<br>our R&amp;D spend as we now anticipate R&amp;D cost to be up approximately 15% this year.<br>
Second, we anticipate benefiting from the weakened dollar against certain other major currencies, including the euro. Although weaker dollar<br>versus currencies such as the Chinese yuan can be a negative for us, in general, Brady benefits from a weaker dollar.<br>
Included in our F '18 guidance is low-single-digit organic sales growth, which will be driven by continued strength in our ID Solutions business.<br>Our guidance is based on foreign currency exchange rates as of January 31, 2018, and includes other key operating assumptions, including<br>depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $26 million and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million.<br>
Our capital expenditure plan decreased as we no longer expect that the purchase of certain strategic facilities will occur this year. We're not<br>anticipating any restructuring charges, and we're not excluding any onetime item from this guidance other than the $21 million of tax charges<br>that I just mentioned.<br>
I'll now turn the call back to Michael to cover our divisional results. Michael?<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thank you, Aaron. Slide #13 summarizes the Identification Solutions' second quarter financial results. IDS sales increased by 8.1% this quarter,<br>finishing at $206.4 million, with organic sales improving 4.7% and with foreign currency translation increasing sales by another 3.4%.<br>
Organic sales growth was led by EMEA and Asia, with both regions posting growth in the high single digits, while organic sales increased in the<br>Americas in the low single digits in the quarter.<br>

<hr>
<A name=354></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:30PM, BRC - Q2 2018 Brady Corp Earnings Call<br>
Sales growth in Europe was strongest in Western Europe and in our product ID, Wire ID and Safety and Facility ID product lines. The team is focused<br>and dedicated and continues to win new business while growing sales with our existing customer base.<br>
Organic sales grew throughout the IDS Americas region, with the strongest growth in our Wire product and Product ID product lines. We're gaining<br>momentum and growing both sales and profit within most of our key product lines in this region.<br>
Mid-single-digit sales growth within our U.S. industrial customers was partially offset by a decline in organic sales in our health care product line.<br>We continue to face pricing pressures due to factors specific to the health care market, which includes consolidation of food purchasing organizations<br>and large health care organizations and the uncertainty presented in the legislative direction of health care in the U.S.<br>
We're addressing these pricing pressures through our continued investment in R&amp;D. In fact, we've increased our investment in health care R&amp;D<br>projects by 28% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year.<br>
Our new product development process remains a key area of focus for us. We're partnering with our customers to better understand their needs,<br>and we're incorporating their feedback into our planned new product launches and updates. I'm excited about the work that we're doing in R&amp;D,<br>and I'm looking forward to new product releases in the upcoming quarters.<br>
IDS finished the second quarter with $34.1 million of segment profit, which is an increase of 17.7% over the second quarter of last year. This is a<br>direct result of the team's focus on growing organic sales while identifying efficiencies throughout our manufacturing facilities and SG&amp;A.<br>
As a percentage of sales, segment profit improved to 16.5% this quarter compared to 15.2% last year. Our expectation for this business for the full<br>fiscal year of 2018 remain unchanged, which is low single-digit organic sales growth and segment profit in the mid- to high teens as a percentage<br>of sales. We expect to continue to invest in R&amp;D, and our efficiency activities in our facilities and throughout our SG&amp;A structure should continue<br>to provide benefits that will more than offset our investment in innovation.<br>
Moving along to Slide #14, you'll find our Workplace Safety review. Sales increased by 5.6%, which consisted of organic sales decline of 0.5% and<br>an increase from foreign currency translation of 6.1%.<br>
In fact, if you exclude the impact of our small local business that we sold in June of 2017, organic sales would have been slightly positive for the<br>Workplace Safety division in Q2.<br>
Sales growth continued to be led by our European business, which makes up 50% of total WPS revenue. This business continued streak of organic<br>sales growth by posting low single-digit growth in the quarter. Online sales continues to be the driver of growth in the region, and we saw high<br>single-digit growth again this quarter. The European team is identifying new sales opportunities while expertly managing the catalog to digital<br>shift that's been underway for several years.<br>
Pricing pressures impact the European business just as it did to the U.S. business, but these challenges are more than offset by efficiency and<br>improvements in our SG&amp;A cost structure in this business.<br>
Our Australian business increased organic sales on low single digits while adding solid profit improvements as well. The team is identifying new<br>sales opportunities and growing sales with existing customers. We're gaining momentum in Australia, we're executing our strategy, and we're<br>delivering consistently improved financial results.<br>
Our North American business is turning the corner as the rate of sales decline is low -- in the low single digits compared to last year. Our average<br>order size continues to increase. We're gaining momentum that we expect to continue throughout the back half of this fiscal year. We continue to<br>face pricing pressures, which are compressing margins in our less proprietary product offerings, but our strategy in this business is to focus our<br>energy on our proprietary product offerings and our custom capability, both of which are our strengths.<br>

We believe this will help to further stabilize margins and return the business to consistent profitable growth. We're continuing to take action to<br>improve the WPS business' organic sales growth through 3 priorities. First, we're working to improve the buying experience for our customers so<br>that it is simple as possible, reaching our customers in a way they would like to be reached, whether it's online, mobile, catalog or in person, is<br>essential to gain market share and grow this business.<br>
Second, we're increasing our customer interaction to provide more value than simply filling orders. This allows us to understand what our customers<br>are dealing with from a safety and identification standpoint, and to better serve those needs by offering our compliance expertise and complete<br>solutions.<br>
Third, one of our strengths is our ability to customize and quickly turn orders around to our customers. So we're improving our portfolio of products<br>by introducing more customized and proprietary products that our customers need while providing them with our extensive safety and compliance<br>expertise.<br>
Segment profit in the WPS business was $7.1 million compared to $6.1 million in last year's second quarter, an increase of 16.4%.<br>
As a percentage of sales, segment profit was 8.7% this quarter compared to 7.9% in last year's second quarter. We continue to address our cost<br>structure throughout the global WPS segment, and we're investing in sales-generating resources while streamlining processes and reducing the<br>cost of previous orders at the same time. These are the drivers of our improved financial results this quarter.<br>
Our expectations for WPS financial performance for the full year are unchanged. We expect organic sales to be approximately flat, and that segment<br>profit will continue to be in the high single digits as a percentage of sales.<br>
I'm proud of what we've accomplished halfway through fiscal 2018. We're off to a good start, and we're gaining momentum. We've delivered 3<br>straight quarters of organic sales growth and 10 straight quarters of pretax profit growth, and we're capitalizing on new opportunities every single<br>day. That's a trend.<br>
But we have more work to do. We need to keep improving on underperforming businesses, and we need to invest in selling and R&amp;D resources,<br>while at the same time driving operational excellence throughout Brady. We believe we will continue to face pricing pressures in both our WPS<br>and our health care product lines in IDS, which makes our investments in innovation and new products all more important to our long-term success.<br>
We continue to push decision-making further into the company, and the impact of this culture shift is apparent in our financial results, reducing<br>complexity in our global structure, and we're moving barriers so that our local managers can think, decide and act on their feet on a daily basis has<br>been empowering and motivating for the team.<br>
We're constantly working to identify and eliminate nonvalue activities that are not part of designing a product, making a product or serving our<br>customers. We're directly in support of those efforts.<br>
I'm proud of our results halfway through fiscal 2018, but we're not letting up as an organization. I'm motivated to push for more, and I know that<br>the entire Brady team is motivated and excited for what the future will bring. I know that we can exceed our goals and continue to deliver what<br>we've promised to our customers, our employees and our shareholders.<br>
I'd now like to start the Q&amp;A. Operator, would you please provide instructions to our listeners?<br>

<b>Molly Rose Baum</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
This is actually Molly Baum sitting in for George. My first question, could you just provide a little bit more detail on the digital growth in both -- in<br>WPS in both Europe and the United States? Have trends been accelerating here?<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Although we don't get into very deep details on the call on this, we actually haven't seen very positive trends in that regard. And particularly in<br>Europe WPS, we're seeing very strong strength across the board. As you know, that's actually made up of a number of markets, and we're seeing<br>all of those markets do very well. And really, a lot of the strength of their growth there is in that area.<br>
<b>Molly Rose Baum</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
My next question, WPS organic sales, looks like they accelerated as trends were down 0.5% in fiscal second quarter versus a 1% decline for the first<br>6 months. Could you just provide a little bit more color on what's been going well here?<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
As I stated in the commentary, we've really been doing a much better job of customizing our products to our customers' needs, and we're developing<br>new products and taking advantage of our new innovative products to accelerate focus in that market. We've also really been getting a lot closer<br>to our customers than we had in the past, and that's generating both large order sizes and also stronger order patterns, both in actual sales and in<br>backlog, which is a trend for WPS that is new and we haven't seen in a long time. So absolutely, the difference makers for us are our ability to quickly<br>provide unique and customized products, introducing of new products into the marketplace and focusing more directly on making a significant<br>impact in our customers' ability to provide safety solutions.<br>
<b>Molly Rose Baum</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
And I actually have one last question on IDS, could you remind us which products would particularly benefit from a pickup in infrastructure facilities<br>and capital spending? And what are the implications for your product innovation and for mix?<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, our -- any of our IDS safety facilities identification products are going to do very well with infrastructure changes. Anything that's involving<br>literally taking a look at either changing the configuration of a manufacturing space to make it leaner, we do quite well with. In addition, any time<br>that we actually build everything from our pipe marker capabilities to our sorbent abilities across the board, we tend to pick up quite well.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next question will come from the line of Joe Mondillo with Sidoti &amp; Company.<br>
<b>Joseph Logan Mondillo</b> - Sidoti &amp; Company, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
Just wondering on the IDS segment. So you continue to guide towards this low single-digit growth. We're sort of in the mid-single digits for the<br>first half of the year and seems like end markets are trending well. And you've always talked about how that sort of segment and sort of maybe a<br>

GDP x2 type of a business which would sort of trend at sort of a mid-single digit. So I'm just wondering, is there any reason to be cautious heading<br>into the back half of the year regarding organic growth to IDS?<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
We are optimistic about our IDS business. We definitely feel strongly that we are putting in place the right type of new product development to<br>continue our growth curve. I believe that we've actually spoken about GDP plus 2, not x2, rates of growth in that business. But that doesn't mean<br>that we aren't optimistic at all. To the contrary, we believe that the economy is getting stronger and that we have the products to take advantage<br>of that and continue to grow at a rate above GDP.<br>
<b>Joseph Logan Mondillo</b> - Sidoti &amp; Company, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And I asked the question regarding the balance sheet last quarter. You guys continue to sort of maintain sort of this discipline/patient<br>mentality. Just wondering, the balance sheet continues to improve, cash flow, as you noted in your commentary, it looks like it's going to continue<br>to trend really well, so the balance sheet should continue to improve. Your operating have sort of an insufficient -- or inefficient capital structure.<br>Just wondering if there's any update regarding your thinking on the balance sheet?<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
We fundamentally believe that our approach to capital allocation is a strong one for the long term. We take a look at, first and primarily, reinvesting<br>in the business. And as you can see, we've been reinvesting in the business, and we will continue to do that, whether it's R&amp;D, which -- although a<br>large portion does hit our bottom line, includes capital and strong capital. Whether it's in our facilities to making it more efficient, whether it's in<br>purchasing facilities that we believe are key to our long-term future, we are doing more and more of that as we are able, not from a cash perspective,<br>but to make sure that we have the bandwidth and are making wise decisions. In addition, our dividend payouts remain strong, and we remain<br>willing to acquire stock as it makes sense for the company. As far as using cash in other ways such as acquisitions, although we absolutely have a<br>strong analysis of this, we are patient. We need to make sure that we're not buying businesses that don't add significantly to the company. I've<br>always said that we will keep our commitments. One of the commitments that I stated unequivocally about is if we acquire, we will acquire for<br>synergistic, technological reasons. In other words, a company must have a technology that we cannot develop in a timely and cost-effective way.<br>We must help that company when we acquire them and they must help us. So we are patient and that does not mean that we don't think that we'll<br>deploy the capital, we do feel strongly we will. Timing is not one that we will stake because we believe that, that's actually negative to our shareholders'<br>best interest.<br>
<b>Joseph Logan Mondillo</b> - Sidoti &amp; Company, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And then, Michael, last question for me. It's been a few years now since you've been working on improving the productivity of the company,<br>efficiencies, trying to get SG&amp;A as a percent of sales down. Just wondering, looking back to what you've done and looking at the company today,<br>how much room do you think that there's improvement? I mean, SG&amp;A still in a fairly high as a percent of sales, so just wondering, looking 1 year<br>or 2 ahead, in terms of productivity and sort of just the overall cost structure of the company, how much more improvement do you think there's<br>possible?<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, I'd like to say, intrinsically, we do have a business that does require more SG&amp;A, and that we are small volume, high mix, proprietary niches.<br>That said, I feel strongly that we have excellent opportunities to continue to improve our SG&amp;A structure. One of the mantras I've always used is<br>lower the water, you'll see the rocks. And really, the entire corporation has bought into that as they see more opportunities. I'll just -- I'll give you<br>a great example that isn't directly related to SG&amp;A, but it is a very visual. I went to one of our major facilities and challenge them with an audacious<br>amount of space that they would have to open up. And the head of the operations literally said 6 months later that he thought I was insane.<br>

However, 6 months later, he'd already been able to open up half that amount of space so as well to 3 quarters and admitted he could do 3 quarters.<br>And then when I challenged him, he said yes, he actually had plans to do all that space. If we literally just take a look at what we see today, our<br>people often aren't seeing all of the opportunities, but if we continue to improve, we're seeing more and more opportunities. There are a lot of<br>things that we're working on today. I know our organization never even thought it was possible just a year-plus ago. So I'm very confident we can<br>continue to do it. I have line of sight. Our team leaders have line of sight. Our managers have line of sight on specific actions we're taking to continue<br>the path. So I definitely feel as good about that as I did when we started it.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) And our next question will come from the line of Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson.<br>
<b>Charles Damien Brady</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
I just want to clarify something. You commented on the FX impact on SG&amp;A. Was there an impact on the -- at the segment level on the operating<br>income of those segments or at the gross margin level for the Corporation?<br>
<b>Aaron James Pearce</b> - Brady Corporation - CFO &amp; Treasurer<br>
Charley, this is Aaron. I can answer that question. From a gross margin percentage perspective, it was very negligible. So we're still at the 49.9%.<br>And if you start -- if you break it down further and you look at it by each of the 2 divisions, ID Solutions as a percentage, it was relatively negligible<br>as well. Now our Workplace Safety business does have a much higher percentage of overseas business than ID Solutions, so they did see a slight<br>improvement in their operating profit as a percent of sales, but it was very slight.<br>
<b>Charles Damien Brady</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
That's helpful. Can you quantify -- I guess what I'm trying to understand what the headwind is on pricing? And does the new product development<br>-- is that helping you counteract some of that -- from legacy products? Or is it just -- the pricing as a whole across the board is just pretty tough,<br>even with the new product.<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, we can -- we need to bifurcate that between the 2 areas that we're seeing the biggest challenge, Charley. One is WPS Americas and the other<br>is our health care portion of IDS. And the drivers for those are different. In WPS Americas, you're effectively looking at a less opaque pricing structure<br>in the marketplace. And so that does create more challenges. That said, by driving more proprietary products, by really providing complete solutions,<br>we're giving our customers things that other companies really aren't and can't do. That result means we can overcome that. But obviously, on the<br>one-off in the more commoditized space, that pricing pressure is stronger. Now let's flip over to IDS and the health care space, what you're looking<br>up there is a consolidation of buying groups. you're looking at consolidation of health care providers. Whenever you see that, the leverage that<br>they can maintain over pricing is higher than before. And as a result of that, with our less proprietary products, we, once again, are facing more of<br>a challenge. In this case, once again, by creating unique proprietary products that we're pretty excited about, that actually not only add value but<br>often create a price point that's exciting for the hospital in addition, and yet give us greater total revenue at better margins. It's a win-win for both<br>our customer base, the buying groups and Brady overall. So yes, developing these proprietary products and the type of products we're doing does<br>have a definite positive impact in overcoming that.<br>

<b>Charles Damien Brady</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
I wonder if you could give us an example, when stated about more customization or complete solutions, just to help us better understand exactly<br>kind of what that means and examples of stuff you've done?<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Sure, so, if you give an example and somebody wants a stop sign, that has definitely a more commodity feel to it. However, if somebody comes in<br>and he's putting together an entire new building, and we can work with them on their safety needs and their identification needs and their total<br>package, we end up being very uniquely suited to doing that. And that total package adds tremendous value to them, and also adds significantly<br>more value to us.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next question will come from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.<br>
<b>Keith Michael Housum</b> - Northcoast Research Partners, LLC - MD &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
My question for you in terms of the WPS segment and the move more towards proprietary products. Can you speak about the level of proprietary<br>products versus commodity products now and perhaps where it was a year ago? And I guess, where we anticipate the mix being a year from now?<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Although we don't -- good morning, Keith, by the way. Although we don't break out the actual mix, I will tell you that we've spoken about the<br>percentage, I believe, Aaron, of manufacturing, which is about 50%. We are planning to move that up. We see, in the longer term, being able to<br>get another 20% out of that. We, obviously, do want to maintain a healthy portfolio of products that we don't necessarily have expertise to develop<br>and manufacture to provide complete solutions, but we are uniquely positioned in our space to really provide most of the solutions ourself. It has<br>been fascinating as we've been really working on both new products and looking at the products we make at the ability of the group to see<br>differently how they should be positioned and how that -- what they should manufacture and what they shown. So we're confident we're going<br>to move ahead, as I said, to those numbers. And more importantly though, as we add that percentage, more of those products will be ones that<br>are truly differentiating to the Brady organization and WPS specifically.<br>
<b>Keith Michael Housum</b> - Northcoast Research Partners, LLC - MD &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
In view of the capacity and the equipment to do -- to increase that manufacturing? Or that will be included in traditional CapEx increases?<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
As far as specific equipment, that is a case-by-case basis. But as I mentioned in my earlier statement about challenging one of our larger facilities<br>to open up audacious amounts of space, one of the things that the leader of that group has done is in the middle of that space, which is significant,<br>put signs and said, this space reserved for future manufacturing and sales. So yes, we have the capacity, we have, in many cases, the equipment,<br>and so we can leverage this quite effectively, I believe. Now as we manufacture new products, we are investing in significant equipment, automated<br>equipment, state-of-the-art capabilities as well, to manufacture those products that we weren't manufacturing before but are clearly within our<br>technology wheelhouse I know we should have been.<br>

<b>Keith Michael Housum</b> - Northcoast Research Partners, LLC - MD &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. If I could sneak one more in here. Michael, you referenced that the second of the year you'll see some new health care products out there.<br>The R&amp;D efforts on the yield have been stepped up for several years now. Are we seeing new products that as -- when born from your recent R&amp;D<br>efforts are hitting the markets? Are they contributing to growth now? Or is that still a few quarters away outside of health care?<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, overall, I would tell you that we are achieving our targets on all of our new products, and that's a big change over just a few years ago.<br>Significantly, a few years ago, we had a minority of our products that were hitting their numbers. Now, we are literally seeing our numbers plus in<br>all of our products that we're developing. So we have a much more robust process in bringing to market. And our pipeline is much stronger for<br>the future. So you will be seeing in this year and coming forward more products executing more effectively and driving more sales, yes. I don't<br>believe I had made an actual statement related to health care products coming out, but we do have health care products coming out as well. So<br>you are correct, but I just want to clarify I don't believe I actually made that statement, but they are definitely coming out.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next questions will come from the line of Joe Mondillo with Sidoti &amp; Company.<br>
<b>Joseph Logan Mondillo</b> - Sidoti &amp; Company, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
Just to have a couple of follow-up questions. When you look at your commodity-like product offering at WPS, specifically in the U.S., have you<br>started to see any sort of slowdown in the headwinds that you've seen in the trends there? Or is that just sort of consistently continuing at a certain<br>rate?<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, I'd like to say a couple of things. One in our commodity products, in many cases, we've eliminated some that just don't make sense in our<br>portfolio, actually, to the extent, over the last couple of years, of tens of millions of dollars in revenue. So what you're seeing as results are net of<br>us eliminating a lot of products that absolutely didn't make any sense. So to that point, without question, we're seeing less headwinds. If there was<br>a product that was commoditized that we really shouldn't have been selling, we aren't selling it anymore. And therefore, we're not literally trying<br>to roll upstream. But in general, because we are moving more to customize in proprietary, we're able to include those products as total package<br>sets. And the end result of that total package set is less -- a less pressure on pricing. But the final issue is, I do think we're seeing more stabilization<br>in the base value of those commodity products as well. But we don't expect to see that go away entirely.<br>
<b>Joseph Logan Mondillo</b> - Sidoti &amp; Company, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And then, in terms of the European part of WPS, do you anticipate any sort of -- the only way -- the best way to put it is just sort of Amazon<br>effect, where that market in a few quarters or at some point in time you sort of see headwinds that you just haven't seen compared to the America<br>portion of the business?<br>
<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
We are looking at our markets there very closely and carefully. I mean, we've mentioned in the past, for instance, our U.K. operations that have<br>more challenges. We're doing better there. Overall, we actually see very strong positions in our ability to both niche and to provide significant<br>value there. We are absolutely aware of the pricing pressures in all of the markets. But fundamentally, I would tell you, we're confident that we can<br>continue to execute in Europe.<br>

And just lastly, in terms of currency, how -- in terms of the way currency affects the model, why didn't you see any -- it doesn't seem like you've<br>seen so much effect to the bottom line in this quarter. And is that going to remain constant? Should we not expect much currency effect in this<br>current quarter, the coming quarters, given the certain rates that we're seeing?<br>
<b>Aaron James Pearce</b> - Brady Corporation - CFO &amp; Treasurer<br>
When I was referring to currency, I was talking in percentages of sales. If you look at our bottom line, we did have -- we absolutely had a benefit of<br>pretax income from currency. So our top line was up 4.2% as a result of currency. And our bottom line was up slightly more than that as a result of<br>currency. So it is flowing through to the bottom line. (inaudible)<br>
<b>Joseph Logan Mondillo</b> - Sidoti &amp; Company, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And that should sort of remain constant if rates stay constant?<br>

<b>J. Michael Nauman</b> - Brady Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thank you. I'd like to leave you with a few concluding comments this morning. We're halfway through fiscal 2018, where growing sales in both IDS<br>and WPS are steadily improving, we're focused on improving the businesses that are not meeting our expectations and driving growth in these<br>businesses, which includes the WPS business in North America, where we believe we're turning the corner. We're facing pricing pressures but we're<br>confident heading for this through efficiencies in our manufacturing processes and throughout our SG&amp;A structure. Growing our pipeline of new<br>products is essential to our long-term success, and our commitment to R&amp;D is unchanged with our increased investment of 19.3% this quarter.<br>We're creating a winning culture that allows us to achieve our goals and to continue to deliver improved results for our shareholders for years to<br>come through our focus on new product development and high-quality customer service while driving local ownership and accountability. As<br>always, if you have any questions, please contact us. Thank you all for participating today, and have a great day. Operator, you may disconnect the<br>call.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the LendingTree, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder,<br>today's conference is being recorded.<br>
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Doug Lebda, Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Thanks, operator, and good morning to everyone on the phone. For today's call, I'll share my thoughts on LendingTree's fourth quarter, provide<br>relevant updates on the business and discuss the progress we've made against our strategic initiatives, before turning it over to J.D. who will then<br>take you through the financials and our guidance.<br>
Before we jump into the numbers, let me first provide a quick disclaimer on forward-looking statements. During today's call, we may discuss<br>LendingTree's plans, expectations, outlooks or forecast for future performance. Forward-looking statements are typically preceded by words such<br>as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or other similar statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and<br>LendingTree's actual results could differ materially from the views expressed today. Many, but not all, of the risks we face are described in LendingTree's<br>periodic reports filed with the SEC.<br>
On this call, we will discuss a number of non-GAAP measures, and I refer you to today's press release available on our website at<br>investors.lendingtree.com for the comparable GAAP measure, definitions and full reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP.<br>
Now let's dive right in. LendingTree's fourth quarter capped off a truly transformative year. In addition to growing full year revenue and adjusted<br>EBITDA by 61% and 65%, respectively, we more than tripled the size of our credit card business, strengthened our position in existing categories<br>like small business and personal loans, and made our first foray into the asset side of the consumer's balance sheet with the acquisition of<br>DepositAccounts.com last June. In addition to exceptional financial performance, we made significant progress against our strategic initiatives,<br>positioning us well for continued success in 2018 and beyond.<br>

<A name=365></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, TREE - Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call<br>
Speaking specifically to the fourth quarter, our financial results came in ahead of our own expectations. J.D. will run through the precise numbers.<br>But LendingTree's performance in mortgage once again outpaced the overall industry, with revenue from mortgage products growing 22%<br>year-over-year during a period where the overall industry was down 21% according to industry estimates. We believe this is evidence of the value<br>we provide for both consumers and lenders in any interest rate environment.<br>
To break this out, Q4 refinance revenue grew 15% year-over-year, while the overall industry was down 42%. Purchase revenue was up 41%, while<br>the industry grew only 2%. Clearly, we are in a purchase environment. And during periods like this, we work very closely with our lenders and have<br>a history of gaining real market share.<br>
In Q4, revenue from non-mortgage products grew 105% year-over-year. Primary drivers here were personal loans, up 74% year-over-year; home<br>equity, up 138% year-over-year; and we're seeing continued strength in our credit card business where revenue increased 35% year-over-year on<br>a pro forma basis. We're also seeing real traction in small business with the integration of SnapCap and are quickly building momentum in deposits<br>as DepositAccounts.com benefits from scale from the LendingTree platform.<br>
For those of you who are new with us, we hold an Investor Day each December where we discuss our goals and provide transparency into our<br>business. This past December, we reiterated our key strategic initiatives, which are: one, to expand into new categories; two, to strengthen the<br>consumer relationship; three, to reimagine the consumer experience; and four, to achieve widespread funnel optimization and marketing efficiency.<br>Based on what we're seeing right now, we remain solidly on track against these initiatives, and you're seeing that progress reflected in our numbers<br>today.<br>
Regarding our first initiative, expanding into new categories. I am thrilled with the solid revenue growth we've seen since the acquisition of<br>DepositAccounts.com and MagnifyMoney. We are now able to engage with consumers across a broader financial product portfolio, increasing the<br>number of interactions with these customers, while also increasing our monetization. We're currently monetizing traffic on DepositAccounts.com<br>and MagnifyMoney, and we will soon launch a deposits experience on both LendingTree.com and inside the My LendingTree platform.<br>
In small business, we're very pleased with the SnapCap integration since the September acquisition, and we see a lot of opportunity here. One of<br>the things you've heard from me in the past is that the benefit of operating across all loan types as we further diversify our business. We're going<br>to continue to invest in and expand into new and relevant categories.<br>
Now in terms of strengthening the customer relationship, this is where My LendingTree comes in. Currently, we have more than 7.4 million users<br>on the platform, with revenue contribution from My LendingTree growing 109% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. We're seeing<br>that as My LendingTree scales, the opportunity to strike innovative business development deals is also expanding, and we'll be announcing new<br>partnerships in the coming weeks. Additionally, we're rolling out a number of personalized features like comparable home sales and customized<br>alerts to not only deliver a -- deliver more value to consumers, but also to improve our monetization. I'm thrilled to see that the numbers continue<br>to move in the right direction.<br>
But I'm most excited about the progress we're making on our third initiative, reimagining the consumer experience by digitizing the mortgage<br>process and improving the post-offer experience on LendingTree. As the scale player in mortgage, it's absolutely critical to enable digital fulfillment<br>for consumers and our lenders. Right now, we have over 40 lenders that have integrated with at least some degree of digital fulfillment, and we've<br>got another 40 lenders in the pipeline. Additionally, we continue to make progress with our new mortgage experience. We continue to test this,<br>a small segment of lenders and consumers, and the results continue to improve, which has been so encouraging that we have now tripled volume<br>into this new experience and have 7 lenders participating in the program. Not only have we been able to drastically reduce unwanted phone calls<br>for the consumer, we've also increased the offer rate by 25% and improved lender lock rates considerably.<br>
Our fourth and final initiative is to achieve widespread funnel optimization, and we continue to make significant strides. Through targeting,<br>automated personalization, testing and machine learning, we're seeing improved page performance, increased engagement and improved<br>conversion rates, all of which are essential as we continue to improve the flywheel of our business.<br>

<A name=366></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, TREE - Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call<br>
With the solid groundwork we've laid in 2017, suffice it to say that we are on track for a successful year ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to J.D. to<br>walk you through the numbers.<br>
<b>J. D. Moriarty</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - CFO<br>
Great. Thanks, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the phone. Thank you all for joining us today. With Doug having already provided relevant<br>updates on the business, I'd like to briefly cover the recent quarter's performance, but also spend some time discussing a few important and likely<br>underappreciated items that impact our results in the quarter and moving forward. There are a lot of moving pieces related to tax reform, equity<br>compensation and our convertible debt that I want to make sure are well-understood. Let's start with the quarter, and we'll get to those pieces in<br>a moment.<br>
In the fourth quarter, the company managed through a seasonally challenging quarter to deliver revenue and EBITDA growth ahead of expectations.<br>In the quarter, consolidated revenue of $161 million represents year-over-year growth of 60% and exceeds the high end of our prior guidance. We<br>always take a conservative approach with regard to our fourth quarter to account for the fact that seasonality has an impact on our business.<br>
And while we certainly felt some of the expected seasonal headwinds, we're thrilled to be able to report better-than-expected results. It's also<br>worth reminding you that the CompareCards acquisition was completed in November of 2016. So our fourth quarter 2016 comparable includes<br>approximately 6 weeks of CompareCards impact.<br>
At the product level, our mortgage business generated $67.7 million of revenue in the quarter, up 22% compared to the prior year. While down<br>sequentially in the fourth quarter, the trends in that business have picked up in Q1, as we would generally expect.<br>
Non-mortgage revenue in the quarter remained strong at $93.3 million, growing 105% year-over-year and 58% pro forma for the acquisitions.<br>We're very happy with the acquisitions we made in 2017. They're trending nicely, with both small business and deposits performing well in the<br>quarter, and MagnifyMoney is complementing a number of our LendingTree businesses. Non-mortgage now represents 58% of total LendingTree<br>revenue.<br>
Variable marketing margin came in at $56.1 million or 35% of revenue. We expanded margins modestly, and we reduced marketing spend in certain<br>channels to optimize profitability. Again, this highlights the flexibility in our model. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter grew 56% year-over-year to<br>$29.6 million and also substantially exceeded the high end of our prior guidance.<br>
As discussed in the third quarter call, we continued to hire aggressively in the fourth quarter to support sustained growth and scale. In the quarter,<br>we added 52 full-time positions, ending the year at 535 total employees. While it's critical that we continue to invest in our people, I'd like to point<br>out that we're still very lean relative to the scale of our business.<br>
Turning now to the GAAP results. There are a few things to discuss that impacted our results in the fourth quarter and some other items that will<br>impact our results as we move forward, and I'd like to take time to address them.<br>
In the fourth quarter, we recorded a net loss from continuing operations of $6.5 million or $0.54 per share. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we<br>recorded a one-time charge of $9.1 million reflected in tax expense and representing a reduction in the value of our deferred tax assets. Also in<br>conjunction with tax reform, we elected to donate $10 million towards the establishment of a charitable foundation. This is a community effort<br>we've been contemplating for a few years, and we felt the time was right to fund this charitable endeavor. This expense is recorded in G&amp;A in the<br>fourth quarter. Both of these charges are fully reflected in our GAAP results and considered one-time in nature.<br>
Excluding the impact of these and other extraordinary charges, our adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.84, which is up 9% compared<br>to the prior year. The primary drivers of the discrepancy between the growth profile of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS are increased amortization<br>of intangibles related to recent acquisitions and the increased interest expense largely related to the accretion of the debt discount associated<br>with a convertible debt offering.<br>

<A name=367></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, TREE - Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call<br>
In addition, the reconciliations in today's press release show that the diluted share count that we use for adjusted EPS increased by more than<br>500,000 shares from Q3 to Q4. The majority of that increase in diluted shares in the quarter is related to the performance of our stock and the<br>dilution associated with the convertible debt we issued last May.<br>
Moving forward, should our stock price continue to increase, we will also experience additional dilutive effects related to certain executive<br>compensation arrangements. To be clear, all of these have been previously disclosed. While it may be difficult to fully mitigate the impact of future<br>dilution, which increases or decreases with our stock price, we acknowledge the impact and will continue to evaluate share repurchases as part of<br>our capital allocation strategy.<br>
In the last 6 months, we've repurchased $32 million of stock. And just yesterday, our board approved an additional $100 million in share repurchase<br>authorization. There are additional matters related to stock-based compensation that you should be on the lookout for in 2018.<br>
First, a large tranche of executive options from 2014 awards vested earlier this month. Given the performance in the share price, those options<br>generated substantial compensation for the recipients, and the company is required to remit payroll taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare,<br>upon the exercise of options. While a few executives have elected to exercise a portion of these options via 10b5-1 plans, others have not yet<br>committed to exercising. Because the expense to the company arises upon exercise and the decision to exercise may depend on the stock price<br>or individual circumstances, forecasting these expenses becomes inherently difficult.<br>
Similarly, Doug has a tranche of 590,000 options from a grant from 2008, shortly after our spinout from my IAC, and those are set to expire in August<br>of this year. And while Doug has generally chosen to retain much of his stake in the company, he will obviously be forced to exercise those options<br>prior to their expiration in August.<br>
We currently estimate the total impact of all of these extraordinary expenses to be $6 million to $7 million on our full year 2018 results. But let me<br>emphasize that this estimate will fluctuate with stock price and is subject to individual exercise decisions. Note that this expense will be included<br>in our -- in both our GAAP and non-GAAP results, as defined. These expenses have been reflected in our full year and first quarter adjusted EBITDA<br>guidance, which I'll discuss momentarily.<br>
Before addressing our guidance, I want to close the loop on the impact of tax reform. Like most companies, LendingTree will, on balance, stand to<br>benefit from this lower corporate tax rate. For 2018 and beyond, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28% as opposed to the 41%<br>that we've seen historically. That said, the full benefit of lower rates will not necessarily be immediately recognized. The same option exercises I<br>discussed stand to produce material tax deductions in the coming year, such that we expect to generate substantial net operating losses for tax<br>purposes in 2018, which we anticipate will be used over the course of 2019 and 2020.<br>
To be totally clear, we estimate operating losses for tax purposes only, not our GAAP results. So while we benefit from, longer term, from a lower<br>tax rate, our near-term taxpayer status minimizes the immediate benefit.<br>
With that, let me provide a bit of context around our guidance for the first quarter and full year. Our full year outlook, which we just provided 2<br>months ago at our Investor Day in December, remains unchanged. While the year is off to a very good start, we'll revisit our full year guidance when<br>we report Q1 in April, the same approach we took to guidance revisions in 2017.<br>
Recall that our full year 2018 guidance calls for approximately 30% growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And remember that the adjusted<br>EBITDA figure includes the impact of the estimated $6 million to $7 million in extraordinary payroll tax I mentioned previously.<br>
Our first quarter guidance introduced this morning is consistent with our full year outlook, representing approximately 30% growth over the first<br>quarter of 2017. Revenue is anticipated to be $170 million to $175 million, representing 28% to 32% over Q1 '17. Variable marketing margin is<br>expected to be $59 million to $62 million. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $30.5 million to $32.5 million, representing year-over-year growth<br>of 28% to 36%. This includes an estimate for extraordinary payroll taxes in the quarter of $1.5 million to $2.5 million.<br>

<A name=368></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, TREE - Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call<br>
I realize that's a lot of information. But as I think you know from our Investor Days, we're committed to being very transparent and communicative.<br>I'd like to refocus on the fundamentals of the business.<br>
As Doug mentioned at the outset, 2017 was a transformative year for LendingTree. We saw the benefits of both organic growth and acquisitions.<br>We bolstered our balance sheet, became the scaled diversified player in our sector and, most importantly, for investors, delivered third year of<br>growth in excess of 50% in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We're seeing great trends in our business, and we are thrilled with the momentum<br>that we're carrying into 2018.<br>
With that, let's open the call to questions.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Mark Stephen F. Mahaney</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst<br>
Two questions, please. On this mortgage digitalization journey, Doug, could you talk about how long you think that will take? Is that a multiyear<br>journey, a couple of quarters? Just how long does it take to get through -- to get material traction in that? And then just very briefly, the total loan<br>request, did you disclose what that was or what the year-over-year growth was?<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Let me take the first part of that, and J.D. can tell you what we can tell you on the total loan request number. The mortgage digitization journey<br>really breaks down into 2 components. It breaks down first into the consumer experience we've talked about, where we -- where LendingTree<br>effectively takes over the initial contact with the customer. We only transmit the customer's information to a lender once they're selected, and we<br>talked about that. I think that's going to be a couple more quarters before we get the revenue from that experience equal to, call it, the legacy<br>business model of the company. But it's moving entirely in the right direction, and I'm actually thrilled and surprised with where it is. The second<br>piece of it is once a consumer actually selects a lender and they're working with them, the digital mortgage experience is effectively automating<br>the processing of loans through the lender system. If you look at companies like Rocket Mortgage and some of the technology that the Velocifys<br>and Ellie Maes and Roostifys and many others have put out, effectively, what this does, it enables the consumer to upload their documents and<br>get automated underwriting upload credit reports, property values, et cetera, without having to fill out lots of paperwork and fax a lot of documents.<br>I think that is probably a this-year event. Lenders are recognizing the increased efficiency gains. Quite frankly, it's many ways becoming table stakes<br>for mortgage companies. You -- if you're the mortgage company that's sitting there saying, okay, fax me in all your documents, while somebody<br>else is saying, click here in one button and everything is uploaded, you're at a continuing disadvantage. More broadly, we benefit from any digitization<br>of any part of the mortgage process, and these lenders just continue to make gains. And it's happening by the third-party tech companies. But it's<br>a long answer to saying I believe it's a this-year event.<br>
<b>J. D. Moriarty</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - CFO<br>
Mark, the second part of your question was total loan request. And we did not disclose it partially -- well, largely because as our models become<br>more diverse, and we've got different revenue models and different products like credit card, it becomes a less relevant metric. What I will tell you<br>about mortgage, however, is obviously, as Doug mentioned, we've moved -- we started moving in the fourth quarter, and we obviously know that<br>we're moving here in the first quarter towards a more purchase environment. So clearly, total loan request in mortgage will be down, but that's<br>indicative of the environment not specific to LendingTree. And as mortgage is a smaller part of the overall business, it becomes less relevant.<br>

<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
And the only other thing I'd add is in the mortgage business, which is cyclical, what you see -- now, we have grown through the cyclicality by<br>increasing bid -- in bids and the level of volume the lenders want. In a more purchase environment, that's the time when mortgage lenders really<br>invest in new technologies to make themselves more streamlined and really to reduce their cost. They need to do it. They need to improve their<br>CRM capabilities. In a refinance environment, they're just trying to close as much business as they can. Now is the time when they actually invest.<br>And so the cyclicality of the underlying business actually really benefits our business here because this is when the lenders actually improve their<br>processes.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer.<br>
<b>Jed Kelly</b> - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst<br>
Two. Has anything you've seen since your Analyst Day regarding higher interest rates or some recent softness in housing sales caused you to change<br>your outlooks for mortgages growing in the mid-teens for 2018? And then we've seen an uptick in the higher non-advertising operating expenses.<br>Other than the payroll expenses you called out, how much of the additional operating expenses in 2018 would you classify as one-time in nature?<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
I'll let, again, let J.D. take the second part of that, and I'll take the first part. I think over the past many years, particularly since we changed our pricing<br>and bidding model and our -- and the way we do our marketing in 2008 following the financial crisis, we've grown through the ups and downs of<br>mortgage. And the same trend continues. So as rates go up, you typically see refinance originations decline clearly, and purchase continues to do<br>its thing based on the underlying housing market. Lenders flip over to wanting purchase customers. They still want refinance customers, there's<br>just fewer of them. And we're able to then help the lenders switch over that business. They increase the bid value for LendingTree lead, and they<br>want more of it because they need more in their other -- they need more because their organic business is not there. So long story short, rising<br>interest rates I won't say helps us. It certainly doesn't hurt us. It definitely makes our lenders pay attention to improving technology and improving<br>processes, which improves conversion rates. And I look forward to the day when rising rates hurts our business because that will mean that we're<br>at about 50% share instead of 2%.<br>
<b>J. D. Moriarty</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - CFO<br>
Yes. So Jed, I guess, as Doug says, when we gave our guide for the full year in mid-December, we obviously are contemplating the rate environment.<br>And so that guidance -- it's a very nice position we're in as obviously, mortgage doesn't need to grow to breaking that pace for us to deliver<br>exceptional growth as a business. And so, no, there's absolutely no change to that forecast at this point. With respect to your expense question,<br>obviously, the one that we're watching, just as any company that's grown headcount the way we have, is payroll, as you point out. And that's just<br>the scaling function. And I would point out that on a revenue per FTE basis, we were obviously incredibly efficient and continue to be so. And so<br>we're very lean relative. In terms of other expenses that you'd identify as one-time, I think they're just scaling things. We can work through with<br>the offline and go through each of the line items, but there's nothing that jumps out at me as a big one-time item.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>

<A name=370></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, TREE - Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>John Robert Campbell</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - VP and Research Analyst<br>
Doug, just back to the digital fulfillment pilot. Anything you can share, just maybe broadly or anecdotally, about the conversion uplift from the<br>digital channel versus the traditional offline channel?<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
It's -- I would say it's significantly higher from the lender's perspective. However, it's really an apple and orange. So if you -- if once you -- instead<br>of sending a customer intro to a lender at the time they fill out the form, as LendingTree is doing that incubation and we're only sending it after<br>they select a lender, it's further down in the funnel. So we're seeing multiples of the locker rates that you would see if we just send them to you<br>sort of raw, however, they're deeper down in the funnel. What I can share is that I think in December, we were saying that we were roughly, I think,<br>1/3 to 1/2 of the monetization versus our existing mortgage experience. The monetization has now moved up north of 50% and it's climbing, and<br>we still have a lot of product improvements to go. So that -- and the lenders, by the way, and you saw some of this at Investor Day, they are wildly<br>pleased with the performance of that, and we've got a lot of interest from new lenders. We expect -- we've got a major industry conference coming<br>up in a few weeks, and we expect this to be a major focus of that conference as we meet with all of our lenders. And we also expect to see them,<br>as we sit down with all of our analytics meetings, asking for significantly more volume.<br>
<b>John Robert Campbell</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - VP and Research Analyst<br>
That's helpful. And then it sounds like as far as this kind of really taking hold across the board, it's a bit of a waiting game. Obviously, lenders -- you<br>have more lenders in that upfront technology. But then also, you mentioned waiting to see at least a kind of in-line payout to the traditional channel.<br>But if conversion is kind of &quot;materially higher,&quot; when do you expect those payouts eventually move well above the traditional channel where you<br>kind of balance out the lender ROI?<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. I would -- if you think about the inefficiency of the -- first off, the current system works the way it does because that's the way it had to work<br>without the advent of real-time pricing technology, real-time processing technology and fantastic CRM systems. I absolutely believe that as that<br>new experience, internally we call that Rulo, you might have heard us use that term before, we expect that over time, that significantly increases<br>not only the payouts, there's a couple more impacts as well, too. First, you match a lot -- you get offers for a lot more borrowers because you can<br>sort of skip the filtering step inside of LendingTree and go directly to the pricing engines. So you see a material increase in customer satisfaction<br>from that. Obviously, you're reducing phone calls. You're also increasing capacity with your lenders massively. So if you go from a situation where<br>a customer is getting called and -- not just get called, but sold by 5 different lenders, and you go from that situation to a lender only gets a customer<br>once they've been selected, you now basically increase the capacity on the network more than 5x. And that opens up a lot more volume that<br>lenders can actually demand.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali from SunTrust.<br>
<b>Youssef Houssaini Squali</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Analyst<br>
A couple of questions, if I may. Could you speak to the margin trends within the mortgage business? I'm particularly interested in the purchase<br>versus refi. There seems to be natural de-aggregation or should be natural de-aggregation in the margin as we get more refis -- I'm sorry, less refis<br>and more purchases. So if you can just speak to that trend. And then on the buybacks, so how should we be thinking about that new authorization?<br>Is it primarily to be offsetting the dilution? Or are you just having that being enacted to be opportunistic? Maybe just help us think through that.<br>

<A name=371></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 2:00PM, TREE - Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>J. D. Moriarty</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - CFO<br>
Sure, sure. Let me start -- I'll start with the buyback question because it's literally just an authorization. As we pointed out, we bought stock back<br>over the last 6 months, over $30 million worth of stock over the last 6 months. And we are deploying a certain amount of our free cash to buy back<br>shares knowing that we have pending dilution. So it's just a capital allocation philosophy in the authorization itself, and that's obviously been a<br>good bet. The authorization itself is just that and consistent with previous authorization. So there's nothing to read into the amount of the<br>authorization. I would read into the consistency with which we're making a bet on our stock and also trying to manage our capital allocation. With<br>respect to your question on mortgage, obviously, we've acknowledged that we are currently in a purchase environment. And the majority of our<br>mortgage business has always been in refi, and refi monetizes better just because of the (inaudible) of the transaction there. And what happens<br>when we move to a purchase environment, where we referenced that we tend to garner market share, is because we demonstrate our value to<br>lenders who are going after an increasingly -- a smaller pool of refi. Okay? And so we saw that certainly in the fourth quarter. I think we're seeing<br>that here in the first quarter. We don't break out individual margin profiles by business. But the nice part about the diversification that we've<br>experienced over the last years, that's a less of an issue for us. And certainly, as we projected our budget for 2018, that was all considered in our<br>guidance prior. So we go through, obviously, industry data and projections for levels of mortgage activity and origination activity when we put<br>together our budget. And so we don't see any diversion from that at this point.<br>

And the only -- just to add on to that a little bit. In terms of at the VMM level margin trends, I would never be looking at VMM percentages. I would<br>always be looking at VMM dollars. What you would typically, for -- and a declining percentage margin is, in some ways, actually very good when<br>you see it. What that means is that lender demand for new customers is higher than what is coming in right now. So therefore, we step on the<br>marketing gas and market into that. To get each new additional customer obviously cost you additional money to get it because we're increasing<br>bids and increasing spend across all of our marketing channels. I've said before, too, some ways you can see the health of the business by how<br>much we're running on TV as well at times. And that's not -- I wouldn't take that one to the banks necessarily because we're always testing and<br>doing different things. But when you see us generally doing more marketing, it means that we're trying to drive more volume to our lenders. On<br>the buyback philosophy, our philosophy is always this, we take -- J.D. and our finance team works with a couple of our board members. We put up<br>-- we put a grid together every quarter so we can both buy back a certain percentage of our cash flow as well as have something in place should<br>things be opportunistically available, which it would, and that's worked very well in the past. The IRR from our buybacks has been phenomenal.<br>

And our next question comes from the line of Kerry Rice from Needham.<br>
<b>Christian Kerrigan Rice</b> - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst<br>
Last question was a good segue for my question on -- I know, Doug, that you do focus on dollars, both generally on the VMM line and EBITDA line.<br>But can you talk a little bit about how your marketing may change over the next year as you really focus in on targeting and penetrating these<br>markets? Do you plan to use television as extensively as you have? And will that change how much you spend on marketing? And then maybe a<br>corollary to that is, as you go through this digitalization process, wouldn't that inherently boost some margin because of the, just less friction points<br>and things like that, is that the way to understand that? And then the final question is just on personal loans, saw a really nice growth in Q4. Was<br>there anything that changed in the industry or things that you did to drive that growth? And should we think of this as kind of the level set as we<br>look into 2018?<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Sure. Just hitting on the marketing mix and some of the things you might see. I would say, with some of the acquisitions we've made, we have<br>made significant progress in, I don't even want to call it SEO, I would call it putting fantastic great content out on the Web and syndicating it in<br>

areas and on our site that Google and other websites love and they love to link to it, so we actually are increasing our capability there. Obviously,<br>that stuff comes for free. And we avoid any of the black hat tricks and make sure that, as I said, we're delivering great content. The other change<br>you could expect to see is that we will be broadening our advertising and you'll see us, not only potentially advertise the CompareCards brand<br>brought to you by LendingTree across all of our channels, but you'll also see us increasing the breadth of the product advertising that we're doing.<br>As the monetization in these non-mortgage products improves, we have more and more leeway to go out and drive volume. And it's not just the<br>monetization improving, it's also the level of demand improving as lenders just want to continue to grow and lend, and our market share is still<br>low. I'll let J.D. handle the personal loans question.<br>
<b>J. D. Moriarty</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - CFO<br>
Sure. Kerry, as you asked about personal loans, it's actually highly related to your overall marketing question, right -- or the answer is, I should say.<br>The marketing messaging in personal loans has been shifted to be much more about the consumer need as opposed to the product. And that's<br>been really effective for us. I think it's just -- it's a very good product for us as well and one where we feel like we have exceptional market share.<br>But marketing has clearly enhanced personal loans. And for that business to have hit scale in Q3 and maintain that scale in a seasonally challenging<br>Q4 is exceptional. And so -- and we've seen that trend kind of continue here in Q1. So we're really excited about that business, and I'm glad you<br>brought it up. That's really the main driver. And then the only other thing I'd emphasize is we're going through, from a marketing perspective, a<br>lot of segmentation exercises. And to your point, we can become much more personalized. And we are also testing at a much higher velocity than<br>we were a year ago. And so as the business gets bigger, we start to benefit from scale. We start to be able to affect some large-scale tests in every<br>one of our businesses, and personal loans has benefited disproportionately.<br>

And our next question comes from the line of Hamed Khorsand from BWS Financial.<br>
<b>Hamed Khorsand</b> - BWS Financial Inc. - Principal &amp; Research Analyst<br>
First off, could you talk about My LendingTree and what you're seeing as far as the product's subscribers are looking at and purchasing that's driving<br>the revenue growth there?<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Sure. I think I could say it's across the board. Given it's still fairly early, you're going to see more activity around credit cards and personal loans as<br>they're also the things that as your credit score improves, most easily can improve. The other interesting thing I would say is that there's an<br>opportunity inside of My LendingTree with people that actually can't get offers today that we can actually help improve their credits. So it's a<br>fantastic Net Promoter Score experience. But I would say in the early days, particularly since most of our traffic, that signing up through that is<br>coming through LendingTree, so they're non-homeowners, you're going to see it mostly in credit cards and personal.<br>
<b>Hamed Khorsand</b> - BWS Financial Inc. - Principal &amp; Research Analyst<br>
Is it still 6% to 8% of your total revenue?<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>

<b>J. D. Moriarty</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - CFO<br>
Over 10% now.<br>
<b>Hamed Khorsand</b> - BWS Financial Inc. - Principal &amp; Research Analyst<br>
Okay. All right. And then last question is on the lender composition, has there been a significant change in mortgages given that now you're going<br>into more purchase as far as the demand go?<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
No. What we've seen and we always hopefully said is that lenders who can do a refinance can close a more -- purchase loan, too, and they gravitate<br>to the ones with the highest conversion rate to the most profit and the easiest to process. And as the easy ones go away, they are willing to work<br>a little harder and improve their processes to do so. That happens, not just switching between refinance and purchase, but it also means you add<br>in more states, you increase your caps, which is your overall level of volume. You might increase your filter settings, reduce your -- or increase your<br>LTV settings, reduce your loan amount settings and also, typically, up your bids that you're willing to pay as you see conversion rates improve.<br>
<b>J. D. Moriarty</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - CFO<br>
The only other thing I'd add to that, Hamed, is when you see a lender go off of a network, sometimes it reflects that they're just not succeeding on<br>it, and we replace them with a more successful lender. And that's actually an opportunity for us to grow a new lender. And so that's something<br>we've seen across a number of products. And we just look at this as an opportunity to diversify our business and expand our relationships and<br>overall coverage.<br>
<b>Hamed Khorsand</b> - BWS Financial Inc. - Principal &amp; Research Analyst<br>
But isn't there also somewhat of a delay as far as the purchasing activity and what the bids are when it comes to a rising interest rate environment?<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
No, it happens -- we actually -- in sort of the real-time nature of how our business works, it's interesting you guys kind of -- I mean, investors see<br>things on a quarterly basis. We see changes in demand. Like for us, a refi versus purchase is just reflected in demand, and it's no different than Texas<br>versus California. And sometimes, there's more demand in certain areas. So every day, we're seeing increases and decreases in demand. And demand<br>is price, it's quantity and it's coverage. Those are the 3 functions of the demand equation. And we see those things change instantaneously, and<br>they change exactly in tandem with the corresponding marketing cost for us to go generate that volume. So as the lenders are instantaneously<br>changing because they're reacting to their own pipelines and what they're seeing in their own shop, that is being instantaneously seen on the<br>marketing side. And you either see marketing cost per visit rise or lower in tandem with the revenue, and that's why we're able to grow VMM and<br>EBITDA in any interest rate cycle.<br>

<b>Stephen Hardy Sheldon</b> - William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Analyst<br>
You're continuing to talk positively about the opportunity on the asset side for consumers. So I guess, what do you think you need to do to see<br>that really become a material business for you over the next few years? Is it about expanding consumer awareness or getting the monetization<br>there right with banks and other depository institutions? Just I guess any color on that.<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Sure. So this started with the purchase of DepositAccounts.com. And as I said in our remarks, we're now taking that experience, not just across their<br>site, but also putting that on LendingTree. These -- we also see that benefiting from our business development team. As we're out there doing<br>deals with publishers, we can get better payouts because we not only have deposits, we have all the other lending products as well. Really, to see<br>this thing scale and obviously, the closest competitor here is Bankrate, and I would put this similar to credit cards, which is we bought a -- one of<br>the insurgents in the credit card business, but had very good payouts. And with the combination of great work from their team, which is now we're<br>all one team, great work from the LendingTree sales team, great work from the BD team, we were able to not only increase demand that those<br>lenders want from us, make sure the payouts stay up, but then we can go and turn on the marketing gas. The same thing is going to happen in<br>deposits for the smaller player compared to the insurgents here. We know from our lending partners, we have a very good product. They like the<br>quality of what we're sending them, and they want more of it. And so we just now need to deliver more of it. And then as they add more products<br>and they increase their -- the demand, then we can go fulfill it. So it's going to work, I think, very similarly to credit card. And we really benefit here<br>by having a great product, but with a brand name that's not as well-known in the market where we can add the LendingTree brand name, add<br>some of the LendingTree BD capabilities and just replicate what we did in the other products.<br>
<b>J. D. Moriarty</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - CFO<br>
Stephen, the only thing I would add is with My LendingTree, right, we're trying to -- our opportunity with My LendingTree is to have it be a diversified<br>platform with many interest for consumers. And so having something meaningful on the asset side of the equation is really helpful for us. And so<br>as we go throughout the year, we're going to continue to add tools and things to drive engagement that are actually of value for the consumer.<br>Deposits feeds into the My LendingTree strategy extraordinarily well. And so we think we'll have a real advantage in driving engagement.<br>
<b>Stephen Hardy Sheldon</b> - William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Analyst<br>
Okay, that's very helpful. And then, I guess, just within the 2018 guidance, could you maybe walk through your expectations kind of by revenue<br>type? Where would you expect to see above-average growth across the different business lines and maybe where would you expect to see<br>slower-than-average growth?<br>
<b>J. D. Moriarty</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - CFO<br>
Sure. Listen, our guide reflects the mortgage environment that we're in right now based on rate. We've talked about that certainly at the Investor<br>Day. While we're not calling out individual products, some of the non-mortgage businesses that have been incredibly resilient to a rate environment<br>have been (inaudible) to us. So obviously, we talked previously about personal loans. That's been a great non-mortgage business for us. We're<br>continuing to take share in credit card. We've mentioned other businesses like deposits and small business. I think the really exciting thing is where<br>we'll see what I'll call the fourth leg of the stool for non-mortgage. And we've got 3 businesses right now that make up the -- make up over 80% of<br>non-mortgage. That's credit card, personal loan and home equity. And we think sometime in the back half of this year, you'll see the fourth leg<br>establish itself.<br>

<b>Michael John Grondahl</b> - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division - Head of Equity Research &amp; Senior Research Analyst<br>
Just a question about revenue growth, core revenue growth. If you try to subjectively bifurcate it between existing customers and new customers<br>at a high level or even at the product level, how do you kind of see that in 2017 and maybe 2018?<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
It's a good question. And I can tell you it's not the way we model out the business. We obviously know internally what is new and what is existing<br>customers. It's not something that we disclose because any -- except for the My LendingTree stuff. So I mean, if you just look at it from there, by<br>definition, any revenue from My LendingTree means that's coming from an already existing customer. Now some of those people -- because most<br>of those people are coming through the other loan types. So you've got at least 10%. I believe in the past, we've said about 20% of all of our revenue<br>is &quot;organic.&quot; But we'll get you -- we can potentially try and get you some more specific numbers there. But really, the business gets modeled out at<br>the core physics in what we call the flywheel level, where you're looking at what is my expected revenue for every customer who's visiting our site,<br>what's the demand across all the products, then you go try to optimize your marketing spend against that, and any revenue from existing customers.<br>The nice thing about that is it's typically coming with no marketing cost. However, here's what makes it somewhat more complicated, which is<br>why we model it differently. Think of an existing customer who wakes up one morning and sees a TV ad and decided it's time to go refinance their<br>mortgage, and they go to Google.com and they type in LendingTree, and then they click on a LendingTree ad. Is that an existing customer? Or do<br>we just pay to get that customer to come back again? It's actually both. So we think the VMM way is a better way to look at it. But what we look at<br>internally is obviously repeat business and engagement, and the way we really look at that is on the My LendingTree platform and the fact that<br>that's now over 10% of rapidly growing revenue with fantastic Net Promoter Scores, I think, is testament to that.<br>
<b>J. D. Moriarty</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - CFO<br>
The only -- listen, the only thing I'd add is Doug's answer is based on the consumer customer, not the lender customer. And let me emphasize, we<br>don't need to add any lenders or issuers to meet all of our growth objectives and then some. Obviously, there are a number of metrics that we<br>watch very closely on a weekly basis that we don't disclose, like average spend per lender or we watch what our top 5 or top 10 represent of a given<br>product. But we've [disclosed] any of that information obviously for competitive reasons. We feel pretty good about those trends. And as I mentioned<br>before, sometimes a lender moves out, then we look at it as an opportunity to grow another lender.<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
And if you meant it on the lender side, I apologize for that, the only thing I would add to that, as you think about the flywheel that we've talked<br>about and just the way the business works, by having -- and again, this is just like a search business, so it's sort of like asking Google. Hey, if somebody<br>stops bidding on the keyword mortgage rates, does that take down your overall revenue? The answer is no because there's hundreds of other<br>companies in there that are bidding on the term mortgage rates and every other keyword under the sun. The same thing is true with LendingTree.<br>We've got hundreds of lenders. And the liquidity of any marketplace business, the more lenders you have in there, the more variation you have in<br>how they do underwriting, in how they do marketing, in how they see the world, the better off it is for us. So we see -- for example, in personal<br>loans, once you've got 40 or 50 lenders, you start to see pricing change, so we have a 500 basis points spread for the consumer between the low<br>price and the high price. You have verifiable savings, and that happens because you've got all these lenders. So when 1 or 2 lenders has a problem,<br>which by the way, they always do. I can promise you at any given time over the 21 years we've been running this, some lenders always pulling back<br>and some lenders are always expanding. But we benefit from the aggregate demand from all 500 lenders, not any individual lender.<br>

<b>Robert Wildhack</b><br>
Quickly on the repurchase. Is there any chance we could see the share count actually coming down this year or not so much?<br>
<b>J. D. Moriarty</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - CFO<br>
I mean, to be clear, it's a capital allocation strategy. We're not going to totally offset the dilution. And our intent in going through this in this level<br>of detail with you is to then recognize that we will work through with you kind of our assumptions around pending dilution throughout the year.<br>So -- but no, I don't -- we won't be buying back that much stock now.<br>
<b>Robert Wildhack</b><br>
Got it. And then as My LendingTree revenue contribution continues to grow meaningfully and you continue to increase engagement there, I'd<br>expect that, that revenue comes on with maybe less marketing behind it. So is that -- as My LendingTree grows, can you just kind of share your<br>thoughts with us on the decision view past that through the profitability versus reinvestment in broader and maybe brand marketing, just how<br>you're thinking about that?<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
So 2 things there on the marketing side. So first off, if you've got more revenue coming from My LendingTree, that additional revenue per customer,<br>it's factored back into the bogey, if you will, that we give to marketing. So for example, let's just say we're adding an additional $3 for every lead<br>that we generate because a certain percentage of those people sign up for My LendingTree. We then say, hey, our revenue for this lead type from<br>that channel is $3 higher. Finance has that in the systems. And then, therefore, that is immediately transmitted to the marketing team to go drive<br>VMM dollars. So any increase in revenue per customer, whether it comes from cross-sell, higher conversion rates, better pricing, better coverage<br>or My LendingTree revenue goes immediately back into marketing. The second thing -- and all of our marketing, by the way, is profitable. So even<br>when we do &quot;brand advertising,&quot; we're pretty tight on this that we make sure that we're making money with the dollars that we spend now. Offline<br>has a bit of a couple months lag to it, but it still makes us money. The exciting thing that I would say, we're getting closer to the time where we will<br>be able to advertise My LendingTree/come to LendingTree, get a free credit score and get alerts to save you money throughout your entire life.<br>We will be able to do independent marketing of that product as the expected values continue to improve. And I think we're getting closer and<br>closer to that day right now. When that happens, that could really open the flood gates to growth, but we need to make sure that the expected<br>value to revenue is there so that we can advertise that. Last thing I'd say on that front, because we've got this big -- this always great product<br>diversification, that also adds to our marketing. So when we go -- if you look at the competitors in that space, let's take a Credit Karma, who does<br>not have the level of product breadth that we do for monetization, doesn't have the depth of lender coverage, their monetization is going to be<br>lower, we would expect that just like our monetization and mortgage is higher and we can go win business development deals against our<br>competitors, we would expect that our monetization in My LendingTree will be higher than our competitor's products, and therefore, we'll be able<br>to more profitably spend on marketing.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Doug Lebda for closing remarks.<br>
<b>Douglas R. Lebda</b> - LendingTree, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Thank you very much. And again, thank you to everybody on the call for your attention. To just wrap this up, I just would say a couple of things. I<br>am pleased about so many things with the company. It's actually difficult to wrap this, but I'll just highlight a couple.<br>

Number one, on the acquisitions. M&amp;A is always a dicey proposition for any company. However, for us, it's proven to be incredibly successful. It is<br>because we've got a fantastic process, because we're able to identify real synergies and we're able to identify before we actually do the deal because<br>a lot of times, we are able to apply what LendingTree already has with the product and the team for something else, and we can put those things<br>together.<br>
And I think on the third point on acquisitions, we are increasingly proving that we are the best home for entrepreneurs. The case studies that we've<br>got from our initial acquisitions, we can now go to an entrepreneur and say, listen, do an earn-out with LendingTree and you're going to make<br>more money than doing your series C, D, E, F and G, and praying for an IPO 5 years from now. Why don't you just come on, change jerseys and let's<br>blow this thing up to the moon.<br>
Second thing is our core business and our processes are absolutely working. We like to say around here that we're always skating where the puck<br>is going. We've been ahead of changes on the management team, trying to continually upgrade our management team, trying to continually make<br>sure that we've got great talent development processes. And we've got, I think, one of the best teams of any Internet company and certainly, the<br>best team that I've ever seen at this company.<br>
And then the third thing I would say is that we're still in the early days. We're still at a 2% [reasonable-ish] market share. But that continues to grow.<br>The model is working for lenders. We've got verifiable savings for consumers, and that enables us to continue to grow our distance from our<br>competitors. And then all of that together is giving us tremendous confidence for 2018 and beyond.<br>
So to just conclude, I would like to say, first, thank you to our employees for all the work you do. I'd like to say thank you to our lenders and our<br>marketing partners for your trust in us. And I'd like to thank our shareholders for your confidence in our company, and we look forward to talking<br>to you again in a couple of months.<br>

<b>d. </b>Since start of 2018, expanded relationship with Cogir Management Corporation by bringing them into partnership pool.<br>
<b>i. </b>Pleased to have created JV vehicle with this important next generation Canadian operator and looks forward to working<br>
with Matthew Dube and his team in this new construct.<br>
<b>8. </b>Flu:<br>
<b>a. </b>Can impact seniors housing revenues and expenses through a voluntary and mandatory admission span, higher than<br>
avg. move-outs due to illness or death and also with higher costs anytime that caregivers are temporarily replaced by<br>agency labor when they are sick.<br>
<b>i. </b>Monitor these trends closely and Co. knows if individual cases where flu have impacted its communities.<br>
<b>b. </b>This year's flu season has been subject of headlines due to its severity and widespread nature in its most recent report,<br>
CDC is calculating 130% increase thus far this season in outpatient visits related to influenza-related illnesses for individuals<br>65 and over in US vs. last year, and 92% increase vs. difficult 2014-2015 period.<br>
<b>c. </b>Season is not over, so it's hard for Co. to quantify precise impact of flu at this time.<br>
<b>d. </b>Satisfied with work Co.'s operating partners are doing to care for their residence and staff, and to minimize financial impact<br>
of flu may have on its communities.<br>
<b>9. </b>Brookdale Senior Living's announcement:<br>

protracted period will now allow them to get back to basics.<br>
<b>b. </b>Satisfied with portfolio holdings with Brookdale and will continue to collaborate with them going forward just as Co. has<br>

<b>IV. 4Q17 OPERATIONS REVIEW (S.M.)</b><br>
<b>A. Highlights:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Same-store portfolio grew 2.1%, bringing total avg. same-store NOI growth to 2.7% for 2017 towards high-end of initial<br>
expectation of 2-3%.<br>
<b>2. </b>Senior housing operating portfolio grew 1.5%.<br>
<b>a. </b>Below Co.'s expectation.<br><b>b. </b>Late qtr. occupancy decline due to flu contributed to this performance.<br>
<b>c. </b>This has tempered Co.'s outlook for 2018.<br>
<b>i. </b>Despite that, believes Co. will have a year of positive same-store NOI growth in that business, representing a significant<br>
relative outperformance due to best-in-class assets and [affluent markets] run by premier operators.<br>
<b>3. </b>2018 outlook for SHO portfolio is flat to 1.5%.<br>
<b>a. </b>Actual results will be driven by combination of rate growth, occupancy and expense growth.<br>
<b>i. </b>Low 3% rate growth, 5,200 BP of occupancy decline and 3-4% expense growth built to same-store NOI growth expectation.<br>
<b>b. </b>Set Co.'s initial expectation of 1.5-3.0% growth in SHO portfolio for 2017 and achieved 2.5%.<br>
<b>i. </b>Done through different combination of rate, occupancy and expense growth than Co. thought.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Rates were better, occupancy was lower, so were expenses.<br>
<b>4. </b>In addition to operator-focused relationship strategy, Co.'s heavy investment in data and analytics capabilities are starting<br>
to bear fruit.<br>
<b>a. </b>Outperformed up-cycle and will continue to outperform in more matured part of cycle.<br><b>b. </b>Confident that this superior relative and absolute performance over entire cycle every year on consistent basis will<br>
ultimately result in significant differentiation and cost of capital at some point in time.<br>
<b>B. Genesis:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>As Co. started this journey, focus was to maximize shareholder value on total capital committed to Genesis.<br><b>2. </b>Since Co. last spoke in Nov., it is continuing to be encouraged by relative stabilization of cash flow in retained portfolio.<br>
<b>a. </b>Important changes have taken place in this relationship.<br>
<b>3. </b>As Genesis announced on 02/21/18, they have come to restructuring agreement in which all of their credit parties have<br>
come together to recap Genesis's balance sheet and put co. in position of strength.<br>

<b>a. </b>Feels strongly that Co.'s approach with Genesis have substantially enhanced its flexibility in providing highest value<br>
outcome for shareholders, while minimizing reliance on any one operator.<br>
<b>6. </b>Today, Co. has a materially strengthened corporate credit, standing behind a well-covered lease, which is in stark contrast<br>
of what is seen in industry.<br>

supply and pending demographics surge, demand for skilled nursing beds is projected to surpass inventory by [2024 through<br>2025].<br>
<b>8. </b>While $35m income loss is not ideal, though necessary in short-term, Co. will participate in this positive trend through its<br>
rent reset provision occurring in year five of restructured master lease.<br>

<b>a. </b>Operating performance is stabilizing in Co.'s retained Genesis portfolio.<br><b>b. </b>A material credit improvement due to Genesis recap has happened.<br>

enabled Co. to outperform peers.<br>
<b>3. </b>2017 financial results have been delivered in a year where Co. has also continued to refine its portfolio and lower its financial<br>
leverage.<br>
<b>4. </b>In 2017, generated $1.5b of dispositions with a gain of $344m realized and realized IRR of 11.3%.<br>

<A name=385></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:00PM, HCN - Q4 2017 Welltower Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Vikram Malhotra</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - VP<br>
Shankh or maybe Tom, just sort of stepping back on your last call, you talked about sort of providing a rent cut and simultaneously<br>doing an asset sale, the size, obviously, was not known, but at least I took it as being a fairly large chunk of the portfolio. You've sort<br>of walked through some of the components of maybe what's changed. But maybe if you can elaborate what has changed between<br>then and now, and more specifically on the outlook, given what you're seeing right now, should we expect potentially more dilution<br>from any further asset sales on Genesis?<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
So Vikram, I'll tell you that a few things have changed, right? If you think about Genesis, management has done an extraordinary job<br>of bringing all its credit parties together, just not real estate owners but all the credit parties together to get to a point of a sustainable<br>capital structure. That's extremely important, which we thought they're making progress but they have really surprised us on the<br>positive side of (inaudible) $555 million of fresh capital into the business. So that's something financially puts the company in a<br>position of strength going forward. But more importantly, for our retained portfolio, as you can see, our portfolio now is obviously<br>-- is a much smaller portfolio that is much more focused. It's PowerBack heavy, and we see, after a long time, as I mentioned, and<br>stabilization of cash flow in that portfolio. So that's -- one of the other things have changed. So operating performance has changed,<br>credit quality has changed. Now as you can imagine, that as capital allocators, we look at every asset on our portfolio is on sale, right?<br>So we're looking at this asset quality that we own. We know the coverage. We know what the operating -- really, the operating<br>outlook for those buildings, and we're thinking at this strategy, is it a buy, is it a hold, is it a sell. And I don't know the answer to that<br>question. Like every asset, the Genesis assets are also for sale at the right price. We retain complete flexibility and optionality going<br>forward. I'm not going to tell you that we'll not sell further. I'm not also going to tell you those asset will not be sold. So that's sort<br>of the messaging as we change when information change, when facts change. And Genesis, today, is drastically a different operator<br>than it was 90 days ago.<br>
<b>Thomas J. DeRosa</b> - Welltower Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
And Vik, let me add to that, that we always look to enhance optionality in terms of how we manage this business. And the strongest<br>statement I can make to you is, because Genesis is a dramatically stronger credit based on this restructuring going forward, it means<br>that Welltower is a stronger credit going forward.<br>
<b>Vikram Malhotra</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - VP<br>
Got it. And just to clarify on that. I think you alluded to the fact that you're now in a position to sort of grow cash flow, grow earnings.<br>Would it be safe to say that, assuming there are not too many changes from here on, and you keep things intact, would we -- would<br>you be in a position to actually grow cash flow AFFO and see very little dilution, if any, from Genesis?<br>
<b>Thomas J. DeRosa</b> - Welltower Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
We hope so, Vik. That's how we run the business.<br>

Vik, as Tom said, like we feel like we're at the -- towards the end of the journey. Whether we are in the seventh inning or eighth inning,<br>I can't tell you that, but we're definitely, as everybody else, seems to be starting their journey will feel like we're at the very end of<br>that journey.

with our balance sheet and with, hopefully, where we are in the cycle, that we'll be able to deploy capital as you have heard from<br>Mercedes and Tom.<br>
<b>Thomas J. DeRosa</b> - Welltower Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
So I'll emphasize the fact that we made a number of tough decisions when the wind was at our back. We've never felt the wind less<br>at our back than we do right now. And I'm very glad, and you should be glad we did take those tough decisions when we did them<br>because this is not the time to be starting that. So I want to emphasize, we do believe we're kind of toward the tail end of this journey,<br>and we are -- that is what speaks to the optimism that you heard from everyone here on this call today about the future. We are very<br>optimistic about the role that Welltower will play in fixing health care delivery. And if you redline certain sectors of the health care<br>space, or at least the nonhospital health care space, you reduce your ability to participate in this change which we believe will drive<br>significant shareholder value in the future.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.<br>
<b>Michael William Mueller</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst<br>
A couple of questions. So on the same-store NOI growth, if you would go in and I guess not adjust it for the $35 million rent reduction,<br>what's the post-acute same-store number and the overall same-store growth?<br>
<b>John Goodey</b> - Welltower Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
So that was the question, was if we've adjusted -- not adjusted if it was just as per the January 1 rent coverage, right? I'll describe<br>that number for you. And I think it's -- at the midpoint, it's minus 12.25%, I believe.<br>
<b>Tim McHugh</b> - Welltower Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; Investments<br>
Yes. And for the total portfolio, Mike, it's positive 0.5% to negative 0.5%, the midpoint of flat year-over-year.<br>
<b>Michael William Mueller</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst<br>
Got it. Okay. For overall, okay. And then you talked about the pro forma Genesis coverages. What were the coverages beforehand?<br>So how much improvement is there with all the transactions that have been announced?<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
If you look at our coverage, we'd give you a range and if you look at the range and the sub, it will see that it was close to 1. And it's<br>a very important question, Mike, because if you think about the history of rent cut in this sort of rent-ry profile in this sector, you will<br>see that majority of the times, the landlords have taken the tenant back to sort of 1 coverage, did not give them flexibility to invest<br>in their business, did not give them flexibility to actually grow their business, and that's why they went back to where they started,<br>right? So we absolutely did not want to do that. As Tom said, we're never afraid to take bold decisions. This was needed and this<br>happened. So we feel like, going forward, that you can feel a very significant assurance that we have taken -- we didn't kick the can<br>down the road.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Jordan Sadler</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst<br>
So today's news doesn't sound exactly like you're recommitting to the skilled nursing business or to Genesis per se, but it does sound,<br>at the margin, that you're willing to hold today rather than be a seller at an excessive discount. I'm wondering, one, if that's a fair<br>characterization. And then, two, would you be willing to invest incrementally in Genesis beyond the incremental term loan piece<br>you're lending?<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
John, if you think about a triple net lease, it's a credit, right? So with our credit significantly improved at the property level from a<br>coverage perspective, as you also said, the most important thing is the EBITDARM coverage of about 1.7. And remember, management<br>fee is subordinate to the rent payment, right? And it is guaranteed by the corporate, so at every level you look at it, the 3 level of<br>stratification, it's materially improved. So I want to reemphasize that point. And I also want to reemphasize the point, the rent reset<br>that I talked about. So if you look at the demographics and negative supply, if you believe in the demographics, and you believe<br>that nothing is going to change from a utilization perspective, there's going to be a crisscross of demand and supply, in a not-too-distant<br>future and we will be able to recoup that $35 million of rent, as I said. Will we invest in Genesis going forward? We are, already are.<br>If you look at, we have a PowerBack development, that's in progress, and we believe in that model, so if there are other opportunities<br>to invest in that PowerBack hub and spoke model that Genesis drives its business from, we'll be happy to do that. That's no change<br>from what we have done.<br>
<b>Thomas J. DeRosa</b> - Welltower Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
Jordan, you've heard me say consistently that we are not going to abandon this sector. Why do I say that? Because when you interact<br>with the leaders of health care in this country, which are the CEOs that run the major regional health systems, they all say they need<br>a viable post-acute care option. The problems that the REIT sector has been dealing with were capital structures that were not<br>sustainable given some of the changes that occurred in reimbursement. And as Shankh said, and I say a lot, you can continue to kick<br>the can down the road until you just keep kicking the can at the wall and it keeps coming back at you. What was announced last<br>night and what we have -- are talking to you about this morning is a fix that needed to happen years ago, but the industry kicked<br>the can down the road. We have fixed the Genesis capital structure. It's not just Welltower. It was every one of their capital partners<br>and we brought in a new capital partner. I think that says something about the future of Genesis. So we are in the business of<br>maintaining and enhancing optionality, optionality for where we deploy capital in the best interest of our shareholders. And so<br>nothing has changed. You've heard me say this consistently, and I took a lot of stones and arrows for saying it, but I think our strategy<br>will prove out to have been in the best interest of our shareholders.<br>
<b>Jordan Sadler</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst<br>
Yes. No, that's consistent, I think, with the messaging you've relayed over time. So my follow-up is really on Genesis again. I don't<br>know if this is for John, but specifically as it relates to guidance. What is the total loan forgiveness that you've either recognized in<br>4Q and that you expect to recognize in '18 of the $400-plus-million or so you've got to Genesis -- you had the Genesis? And then<br>what's the embedded total interest income that's in the $4 FFO guide?<br>

<A name=388></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:00PM, HCN - Q4 2017 Welltower Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
So Jordan, I'll answer the first part of the question. The answer is 0. We have not forgiven loans. We have reserved against those<br>loans, so there is a significant difference in that. And two, hidden in your question is, there's something that I saw a lot of confusion<br>about. If you go back and look at our financials of our last 2 quarters and see what we've said, our entire Genesis loan book was in<br>payment in kind. We gave them as they were doing the whole restructuring for last few months. We did not go through a hard cash<br>part PIK payment today. We went from a complete PIK to a part cash, part PIK payment today. With that, I'll pass it over to John.<br>
<b>John Goodey</b> - Welltower Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. And so I think on the pennies front, Tim's going to answer for you on the actual pennies recognized in FFO from Genesis loans.<br>
<b>Tim McHugh</b> - Welltower Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; Investments<br>
Yes. And so part of that answer is, and this is important to note, just on a few notes this morning, we are just recognizing cash interest<br>on Genesis in 2018. So in our FFO guidance this morning, it's just the cash. And as noted in both Genesis' release and that's prior to<br>this, there was no -- these loans ticked from 11/15 to November 15 of last year through February 15 of this year. So if you look at the<br>full year of 2018, important to note, from January 1 to February 15, it was all PIK, and we did not recognize that through FFO. So<br>that's roughly $0.01 of -- on a cash basis of income that if you went full year, full recognition we would have recognized. And then<br>for the rest of the year, they're -- the PIK component represents about $0.05 if you're not recognizing through FFO. What we are<br>recognizing is about $20 million of interest income in our 2018 numbers.<br>
<b>Jordan Sadler</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. So on the forgiveness piece, the -- I guess I'm confused because I'm reading the piece about the bridge loans, the $275 million<br>they have -- you want them to repay no less -- (inaudible) continued to make progress to pay no less than $105 million of obligations.<br>What happens to the $170 million?<br>
<b>Tim McHugh</b> - Welltower Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; Investments<br>
So the -- as part of the announced restructuring for both Genesis and ourselves this morning, is the commitment based upon<br>contingencies of having a financing partner step up in that $105 million refinancing. The remaining piece is assumed to be outstanding<br>for the rest of 2018. So that $170 million will be current cash paying. It is current cash paying right now because after February 15,<br>it went back to cash paying. And the assumption our model is that $105 million is paid back around midyear and the remaining<br>piece of that real estate loan and the term loan remain outstanding for all of 2018 in our cash paying.<br>
<b>John Goodey</b> - Welltower Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
And I think I'll just reiterate, Jordan, what Shankh said. We have not forgiven them loans we have taken a reserve against -- because<br>some of this is collateralized that we have to test the collateral that's underneath the orders as us can imagine make us do that, and<br>that was the reserve that we've had to take relates to the collateral, not to a write-down or the loan that Genesis will, therefore, be<br>forgiven. So there's a big difference as Shankh said, we've not forgiven the $60 million write-down.<br>

<b>Daniel Marc Bernstein</b> - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
I just want to make sure I understand that the 5.2% exposure to Genesis, is that including further loan paydowns or just where it is<br>today?<br>
<b>Tim McHugh</b> - Welltower Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; Investments<br>
The 5.2% is -- so the way that we calculate our in-place NOI is off of just our property NOIs. So if you think about as of the end of the<br>fourth quarter what's currently in our supplement pre-rent cut is a 7% exposure to Genesis. The 5.2% is pro forma for the rent cut.<br>So it's just that.<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
As well as the asset sales.<br>
<b>Tim McHugh</b> - Welltower Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; Investments<br>
Yes. As well as the held for sale assets as of 12/31. That 5.2% is essentially our pro forma NOI exposure to Genesis after rent cut and<br>after sales.<br>
<b>Daniel Marc Bernstein</b> - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Okay. I appreciate that. That's helpful. And then is the change in view on Genesis so much the improvement of credit but also the<br>improvements at the property level? I think you mentioned that a little bit in your comments. So I just want to understand a little<br>bit better what's changing at the property level or operational level at Genesis that makes you a lot more confident in the company<br>there in your assets?<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
So if you look at -- again, I want to emphasize the fact in our retained portfolio, there's a portfolio that, obviously, we're selling now<br>that is transitioning out of Genesis as an operator. Genesis is -- has sold and in process of selling lot of noncore states. So it is important<br>to understand they are refocusing on their core market. Core market's why Genesis always has done very well. In our retained portfolio,<br>which is, as I said, it's very PowerBack heavy, we're seeing cash flow stabilization after a long time. And we believe that if you think<br>about how this plays out, that we will be able to grow cash flow in the future. So that's one of the points, and credit is obviously very<br>self-explanatory. If you can look at the coverage, and you look at the EBITDA coverage and EBITDARM coverage, that's significantly<br>improved above market coverage. And the corporate guarantee is extremely important here, which is today, with the Genesis is --<br>if you look at the Genesis' debt to EBITDA, it got almost cut in half, that's definitely an improvement in the credit. So that's why we<br>feel optimistic. Again, as Tom said, we retain all of optionality, as in any part of our portfolio.<br>
<b>Daniel Marc Bernstein</b> - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And just real quickly on the demographics, I mean, that you talked about and skilled nursing, it sounds like it would apply to<br>seniors housing. Last quarter, you talked about maybe looking for opportunities to more -- loosen more triple net leases to perhaps<br>RIDEA, is that still something you're thinking about working on?<br>

<b>Mercedes T. Kerr</b> - Welltower Inc. - EVP of Business &amp; Relationship Management<br>
This is Mercedes. We look at that, obviously, just selectively with our operators. I mean, there's a lot of things that we might take into<br>consideration. As you know, we like to invest in RIDEA when we think that there is a lot more opportunity for upside than downside<br>risk. And so yes, from time to time, there might be a portfolio that we're seasoning and in a triple net structure that might actually<br>become candidate for a conversion to a partnership. And we don't have anything to talk about right now, but that's something that<br>we obviously look at all the time.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.<br>
<b>Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
My first question is around your same-store NOI outlook for the SHO portfolio. You guys do have an outlook that is positive. Your<br>peers have outlooks that are generously negative. I'm just curious if we just talk a little bit about why your outlook is much more<br>bullish than theirs?<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
Yes. So Tayo, I mean, it's a very good question. I would like you to look at our performance relative to our peers every year for last<br>7-plus years that we have been in the RIDEA business. That will give you the answer, but it's really -- it speaks to the quality of the<br>portfolio and the operators and micro markets. So we have invested -- sort of if you think about how this industry has evolved, people<br>are mostly triple net investors, right? Even when you're investing in credit. Investing in RIDEA is investing in real estate equity. That<br>requires a different type of skill set, and we're the ones who have invested in technology, in people, in data analytics and asset<br>management. So you are seeing the impact of that pretty much every year, probably every quarter, and that outperformance should<br>not be surprising, but we're -- obviously, as I said, that if you look at over a period of time we hope that will give us a better cost of<br>capital. That hasn't happened yet, but hopefully, people will accept that we have a much better quality portfolio.<br>
<b>Mercedes T. Kerr</b> - Welltower Inc. - EVP of Business &amp; Relationship Management<br>
And I do have to add that it also has a lot to do with the operators that we have partnered with. So it's a combination of great locations,<br>a high barrier to entry markets, asset quality, but it's also, of course, having to do with the operators that are in the trenches and that<br>are also willing to collaborate with us and the initiatives that we are trying to source for their benefit and for the benefit of the<br>residents who live with them.<br>
<b>Thomas J. DeRosa</b> - Welltower Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
A lot of it comes from not becoming a passive owner of senior housing real estate. We see ourselves truly as an operating partner<br>and that drives better results.<br>
<b>Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Got you. That's helpful. And then just to confirm with Genesis, it's as a result of the recapitalization plan that the loans are now cash<br>paying rather than the status they were at back in November, correct?<br>

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.<br>
<b>Richard Charles Anderson</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD<br>
The -- if I could step back to November, December time frame, could you describe what was going on there? Did you kind of have<br>some sort of clairvoyant moment where, heck, we better keep these Genesis assets, and that's what rolled up to where we are today?<br>Or did -- was it -- you kind of backed into the situation where you weren't getting the pricing you wanted, you weren't feeling like<br>the rent cut and asset sales were going to protect your debt investments, and so the market worked against you. And now you're<br>kind of like, woo, I'm glad we didn't sell at that time because of -- well, everything you're saying on this call. I'm curious -- the chain<br>of events that got you to this point. Was it luck or skill?<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
Probably a combination of both. If you look at what happened is that we always said that you think about what we're doing, right?<br>Effectively, Genesis management, as I said, pulled off an out of indiscernible] restructuring with all of its credit parties that you never<br>know that will actually be able to get to the finish point, right? Finish line. Second, we absolutely did not think they will be able to<br>get fresh capital of the size that they did from the entity that they did, so there's one point. You are always interested, Rich, as an<br>observer of -- a longtime observer of the industry, how the tree leaves are changing. I would like you to see what happened in that<br>time frame with Kindred and Humana, Welsh, Carson. You could see today what happened with, obviously, fresh injection of capital.<br>I can't talk about a lot of other things because they're nonpublic in nature but things that are happening in the industry. So going<br>back to -- very specifically to your question, do we have the ability to do a transaction? Absolutely. Did you get the price that we<br>wanted? Absolutely. Is that counterparty still around for us to do a deal? The answer is absolutely. So the question is, today, as we<br>are thinking about it, at 1, 3, 4 coverage, with a company that is -- leverage has been cut in half, right? From a 7 to 3, is this group of<br>assets we have called a part of the portfolio, as you heard from John, right? The 10% of the portfolio, is there -- at that price is this a<br>buy, sell or hold? That's what we think about for every asset class. I share the enthusiasm of the market participants have about 4.5<br>cap asset classes that grows 2%. But think about -- at the end of the day, we are here as a capital allocator to make money. Despite<br>all the noise around Genesis, our unlevered IRR is double-digit. The math that is mentioned in low 4%, mid-4%, at a cap rate going<br>in with a 2% growth with a 12% to 15% CapEx, you'll never even get to 7%. We're here to make money for our shareholders. And<br>every time we are making a decision as a group of assets to see, is it a buy, hold or sell? That's what we did.<br>
<b>Richard Charles Anderson</b> - Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD<br>
Okay. Follow-up question is, essentially Welltower shareholders are paying for this Genesis lifeline. And I'm not saying that<br>tongue-in-cheek, clearly, the fortunes of your tenants accrue to the REIT, so it is what it is. You did what you had to do. But going<br>forward, you kind of get into this risky thing where we don't want Genesis, we do want Genesis, we don't want Genesis. So if you<br>were -- ultimately were to sell more, it kind of changes the narrative. So is there some risk that you kind of put yourself into a corner<br>and almost have to commit going forward? Or you don't feel that way?<br>

<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
That is precisely what we did. Tom said every call that we're not getting out of the post-acute business, right? Triple net lease is a<br>credit commitment, right? We're happy to make that commitment if we get the right price. Investing in real estate is all about basics.<br>So if we get the right price, we'll sell, if we don't get the right price, we think this is something that our shareholders can enjoy, their<br>cash flow growth will do it, but we absolutely believe it is derisked not only from the position of coverage but also escalators are<br>down, right? From 2.9% to 2%. That should be appropriate for the business in the footprint where they are, so we have never flip-flop<br>should we sell Genesis, not sell Genesis. We're looking at all of our assets and thinking, is this a buy, sell or hold at the price that the<br>market is willing to pay?<br>
<b>Thomas J. DeRosa</b> - Welltower Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
We actively manage our business. And like any business, things change and we have to be able to be flexible to do what's in the<br>best interest of the business, which is ultimately in the best interest of the shareholder. The public markets were screaming at us to<br>have taken a different approach with Genesis. I think we took the right approach. You may want to debate that with us and we're<br>happy to debate that. But I think we took -- we did the responsible thing for Genesis and for our shareholders, and I think that will<br>prove out versus other roads we could've gone down.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Michael Albert Carroll</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Tom, I wanted to dive a little bit on your comments on the post-acute space. What is your outlook on the reimbursement changes?<br>Where do you believe we are in this transition? And are the major shifts from the post-acute care space now behind us?<br>
<b>Thomas J. DeRosa</b> - Welltower Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
I think it's very difficult to predict what will happen in Washington. The only thing I can say is that you've seen the current administration<br>look for ways to take some pressure off the post-acute care space with respect to litigation. So I think that we take some comfort in<br>the fact that there is a recognition that we have to drive individuals into lower-cost settings. If the government continued to try and<br>put the skilled nursing business because of their reimbursement programs, then we would have a much bigger problem in this<br>country because people would be stuck in very expensive acute care hospital beds. I think there is a changing view in Washington<br>and we hope that a rational thinking will prevail here. We need to drive people into lower-cost settings. The health care industry,<br>the hospitals are still trying to deliver value-based health care in fee-for-service-built real estate. That doesn't work. We will -- our<br>economy will hemorrhage if we continue to think we have to keep hospital beds filled. We need to drive people to lower-cost settings,<br>and so that is why we have never abandoned the skilled nursing sector. And it will be bumpy, but we think now with the restructuring<br>of Genesis, we have the right coverage and credit profile to withstand potential choppiness.<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
And Mike, that's the most important point. There has been a lot of restructuring change -- I mean, lot of reimbursement changes<br>other than RUGS-IV, none of them have been you huge, right? They've been small (inaudible) for sure. But why that has been amplified<br>in the industry is something that I would encourage all of you to think about because of the massive leverage in the system, right?<br>If you think about what happened 10 years ago, people got really excited about the (inaudible) chase and massively levered all these<br>entities. And what we have seen this cycle is the unwind of that. Has there been -- would have been choppiness even if there was<br>

equity finance on these deals? Absolutely, probably would be, but these operators would be in a much stronger position, and that's<br>the key -- is post-acute industry, like any other industry, but post-acute industry is in a very interesting point in its life cycle where it<br>needs to be reimagined and recapitalized in a different way.<br>
<b>Michael Albert Carroll</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Okay. And I just wanted to clarify you guys' stance on the post-acute space. When you're saying you're committed to it, does that<br>mean you just want to kind of maintain your exposure to Genesis and maybe if a good deal pops around, you could grow it then?<br>Are you underwriting new deals? Are you looking for new investments outside of Genesis? Or you're just happy with your Genesis<br>exposure right now?<br>
<b>Thomas J. DeRosa</b> - Welltower Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
We look to deploy capital to good quality real estate in the right markets with good operators in sustainable structures. So if all those<br>pieces line up and it's an interesting new post-acute operator for us, we will consider that. We will consider that if we think it's in the<br>long-term best interest of our business and the long-term best interest of our shareholders. But no, we will not redline the space<br>because of some confusion about what's happening in the industry that was largely due to bad capital structures. Certain people<br>made a lot of money when these post-acute care companies found their ways into the hands of REITs, and REITs until RUGS-IV had<br>well-covered real estate, the world changed and what you've seen us do is fix what was a problem that we've been dealing with for<br>years. We think we've largely addressed that.<br>

Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.<br>
<b>John P. Kim</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior Real Estate Analyst<br>
Turning to Page 11 on your SHO statistics, it looks like CapEx increased this quarter to 34% of NOI versus 22% in the third quarter.<br>And I'm wondering: a, why that occurred; and b, what is in the other CapEx? Is that renovations? Or is that redevelopment CapEx?<br>
<b>John Goodey</b> - Welltower Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
So the answer is, quarter-by-quarter, it does vary. We tend to historically underspend our budgets in the first couple of quarters and<br>overspend relative to the pro formas in the second quarters that come out roughly where we think. And so I think we do see some<br>reinvestment in portfolios. I think we've said on a number of calls, part of having a great a balance sheets is we can drive growth out<br>of existing buildings through CapEx. So as Shankh was saying, how do we look at capital, we also look at existing buildings on the<br>buy, hold, sell mentality for investing more capital. The capital doesn't come for free, as you're well aware. So I think we do address<br>capital requests in that way. And other capital, just -- it is exactly that it is, our other CapEx in those buildings in terms of our -- as I<br>described, our -- I guess our significant reinvestment capital as our best way to described it, I think.<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
Yes, and plus all the Vintage CapEx in fourth quarter...<br>

<b>John Goodey</b> - Welltower Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
CapEx is -- was above all. So we expect more normalized run rate sort of back towards normal. Next year, we don't have a substantially<br>different view of CapEx need this coming year than last year because there are number of projects that we want to do to drive growth,<br>but I said again we do that on a sort of ROI-based model.<br>
<b>John P. Kim</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior Real Estate Analyst<br>
Okay, so redevelopment CapEx is a separate bucket. This is more kind of renovation type work?<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
Both.<br>
<b>John P. Kim</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior Real Estate Analyst<br>
Okay. You referenced Brookdale, the major announcement this morning. Can you just update us on your relationship with them<br>going forward? Do you plan to reduce your exposure and sell assets or maintain it and also the rent coverage because I think last<br>quarter, you were mentioning 1.15x. I'm just wondering if -- what would that be on the outlook.<br>
<b>Mercedes T. Kerr</b> - Welltower Inc. - EVP of Business &amp; Relationship Management<br>
Yes. Our portfolio is fairly steady. So like I said in my comments earlier, we're satisfied with what we're holding. We are always in<br>conversations together. And We have a lot of business together, so we feel very close to one another. So I expect that to continue.<br>Other than that, I guess I could just -- there isn't anything that is glaring right now. We, as you know, always have options with respect<br>to our portfolio. I mean that's one of the real strengths of Welltower is that we have such a diverse and geographically as well as in<br>terms of different kinds of platforms, operator base, and so we always have a lot of alternatives. We feel always like we have a sort<br>of a may be a head start in that perspective -- from that perspective compared to others. So nothing here to report right now.<br>
<b>John P. Kim</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior Real Estate Analyst<br>
And when do your leases expire with them?<br>
<b>Mercedes T. Kerr</b> - Welltower Inc. - EVP of Business &amp; Relationship Management<br>
We have a couple of leases, few leases, 3 of them actually that are expiring later this year. We're not in a notice period with them yet.<br>We, again, have had conversations with them about extending them. We have, once again, opportunities to put some properties<br>with other operators. And considering that the properties are -- these are covering a group of assets, we don't feel like there's any<br>sort of friction that would come of it if we were -- have to move them to somebody else.<br>

<b>Juan Carlos Sanabria</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
First question, Vintage. What was the contribution to same-store NOI in the fourth quarter? And what's the impact for 2018 guidance?<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
Answer to your first question is negative 10 basis points in the fourth quarter. I don't have the '18 guidance with me, but I'll get that<br>to you later. I'll give you a call. And this what the drag for fourth quarter is because as I -- and as John said, that we are -- we spend<br>a lot of capital on the renovation projects that are going on in fourth quarter.<br>
<b>John Goodey</b> - Welltower Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
So a lot of reading back to commission and the capital deployed as well.<br>
<b>Mercedes T. Kerr</b> - Welltower Inc. - EVP of Business &amp; Relationship Management<br>
Which was part of our plan. Let me just add something here, particularly about Vintage because if we're looking at this, we have to<br>-- one of the values of that one portfolio was always kind of our long-term outlook for the strength and the opportunity of having<br>those really select markets, really markets that can be irreplaceable in some cases. And so just as a -- kind of one of the things -- even<br>though we're working through all of the CapEx and (inaudible) might be out of commission while we're working through all of that,<br>I can tell you that the rate of growth in the Vintage portfolio actually exceeds the average Welltower growth rate, which, as you<br>probably know, exceeds the market average as well. So the cities themselves are -- they're [almost] kind of holding out hope for and<br>that we think is an important driving decision for that investment.<br>
<b>Juan Carlos Sanabria</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
So it was a benefit in '18 but it was a drag in the fourth quarter? Why was it a drag in the fourth quarter given the low occupancy<br>starting point?<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
It's a lot of CapEx, as I said, is being spent on Vintage. Right now the renovations are going on. I would not necessarily think it will<br>be a benefit to '18. It will be drag in a few quarters and benefit in a few quarters, right? I would be hopeful that Vintage as a run rate<br>starts to help the portfolio growth starting '19. But as you can see from the CapEx page, that most of the CapEx started to get spent<br>in fourth quarter. So that's kind of drag into Q1 and Q2, and you'll probably see the impact of that towards the fourth quarter.<br>
<b>Juan Carlos Sanabria</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
Yes. On the dividend, what are you guys thinking about going forward? It looks like on your FAD guidance it's in the low to mid-90%<br>payout ratio. So how should we think about that? Any risk of a dividend cut at any point if you decide to sell more Genesis assets for<br>whatever reason or other high-yielding assets?<br>
<b>John Goodey</b> - Welltower Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
No. I think, when you -- I mean, so when you look at our FFO payout ratio, we feel comfortable with that. I think we've done a great<br>job in the last -- we think about it this way, I guess, Juan, which is, dividends are an output, I guess, not an input. And I think there's<br>

components to that, the first component is the quantum of your income stream to pay them and the second is the quality of your<br>income stream. And obviously, our FFO guidance for this year is down by roughly $0.20 to the midpoint, but the quality of that<br>income stream has gone up very dramatically. Elements -- so that's refining our portfolio through 2017, elements of taking the rent<br>restructure on Genesis, et cetera. So we feel very comfortable with the quality of that FFO dividend stream, which gives us comfort<br>around paying the dividend that we've proposed or the board approved going forward. So we feel very comfortable with that. The<br>other thing is we got a great deal of balance sheet flexibility. As you know, we've got pretty much the lowest-levered balance sheet<br>in the sector. So we have the financial flexibility on the balance sheet side as well.<br>
<b>Thomas J. DeRosa</b> - Welltower Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
I'd just amplify that, that in a very long time, based on the quality of the business model here, because of the changes that we've<br>made, the asset quality, the improvement in the balance sheet and the strong cash flow from the decisions we've made to improve<br>the overall quality of this business, the dividend has never been more secure.<br>
<b>Juan Carlos Sanabria</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
Okay. Just a quick question on Genesis. Is there ever any discussion with Genesis about that formation with regards to them to<br>tipping in any equity as part of this restructuring?<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
We talk to formation all the time. So I'm not going to get into specific conversation about what we might or might not have discussed<br>with formation, but you should assume that as majority owner of Genesis, we're in constant (inaudible) formation.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.<br>
<b>Jonathan Hughes</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Associate<br>
I don't think I've heard this yet but could you break down your Shop guidance assumptions in terms of occupancy RUG-IV and<br>operating expense growth and then may be how that occupancy comp should trend throughout the year given the strong flu season<br>to start?<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
Yes. So I did. I'll reiterate that for you. We're expecting a low -- no, we're modeling a low 3% rate growth. That's -- obviously, we did<br>4% rent growth in '17, low 3% rate growth, 50 to 100 basis points of occupancy decline and a 3% to 4% expense growth. But as I<br>said, to give you the occupancy assumptions at the beginning of last year, but we got to the same results, actually better-than-expected<br>results, using a different combination. So I would not -- if I were you, I would not assume these are all independent variables, right?<br>And see where we end up, but we feel comfortable they will be in the range probably through a different combination. The rates<br>could be better, they could be worse, maybe at occupancy, we're thinking down 50 to 100. It could be worse than that or better than<br>that but expenses could be better. So there are 3 levers that drive that number. So that's how I would think about it, not focus on<br>one variable. And from a -- your other question was about how occupancy will trend. Obviously, given the flu, you'll see lower<br>occupancy at the beginning of the year, hopefully, which will ramp back into the end of the year. That's how -- usually, that's how<br>seasonality works in this business anyway. So you'll probably see them more and more pronounced this year because of flu.<br>

<b>Jonathan Hughes</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Associate<br>
Okay. And then just one more on Shop. So with the national average U.S. renter, I guess REVPOR like $4,000 a month and yours is<br>north of $7,000. As the new product under construction, really even that competitive to your properties? I mean, I'm assuming most<br>of the new builds are going to price at about 125% of market, so that'd be roughly $5,000 a month. Just curious as to your views on<br>how serious the new supply threat is to your U.S. Shop assets?<br>
<b>Shankh Mitra</b> - Welltower Inc. - SVP of Investments<br>
There is absolutely no doubt that the new supply is impacting our performance. But obviously, it's impacting our performance lot<br>less than the market average and our competitors. And one of the reasons is what you outlined. The another one is what Mercedes<br>talked about, is the quality of our operator. We have the best assets in best submarkets, not only the markets, which are not only<br>difficult to build but also they're premier asset. Obviously, the quality of care and reputation of those assets in those market matters.<br>And do we think it's competitive? Absolutely. Do we think that we are positioned better than our competition, rest of the market?<br>Absolutely, yes.<br>
<b>Thomas J. DeRosa</b> - Welltower Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
Think about what Mercedes said earlier about Sunrise and J.D. Power. There were 6 categories. They ranked #1 in 5 of the 6 and the<br>one they didn't ranked #1 in was price, which means they're probably a little bit more expensive than others, so they didn't get the<br>#1 ranking there. But that is very significant. You've never seen J.D. Power, the most respected research house for consumer research,<br>ever rank senior housing operators. And it's pretty extraordinary that Sunrise was by far the #1 name in the business. And I would<br>tell you, if you haven't seen that ranking, we'll send it to you because I think it'll be interesting to see where some of the other names<br>have ranked.<br>

And now I'll turn the call over to Sandy.<br>
<b>Alexander D. Macrae</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thank you, McDavid, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to announce today that Sangamo and Kite, a Gilead company, have entered<br>into a collaboration to develop gene-edited cell therapy products for oncology.<br>
Next-generation autologous and allogeneic CAR T and T-cell receptor therapies require precise, efficient and specific genome editing. Kite is<br>investing heavily to win in this emerging field, and we're thrilled to be their chosen partner supplying gene-editing technology for the developments<br>of new CAR-T and T-cell receptor treatments for patients with cancer.<br>
In a few moments, Curt will provide more details of this agreement and what it will mean for the evolution of Sangamo's business strategy. But<br>first, I want to reflect on how the development of the technology has enabled this collaboration.<br>
Our zinc finger engineering capabilities have advanced rapidly in the last few years with improved zinc finger nuclease architectures. Novel<br>enhancements have resulted in a 300-fold increase in potential design options for a given genetic sequence, yielding higher, on-target modification<br>activity with ex vivo editing efficiencies now reaching as high as 99.5%, an off-target cleavage consistently below the level of detection.<br>
We have also made great strides towards industrializing production of ZFNs, which helps expedite our research and meets the needs of partners.<br>The adjacencies of computing and sequencing technology enable rapid screening and the development of lead candidates. It takes us 10 days, 8,<br>if we work through the weekend, to produce a 96-well plate of options that can be further tuned to increase efficiency and remove nonspecific<br>binding contacts to reduce off-target cleavage to undetectable levels. We are combining these advancements in our technology with our experience<br>spanning 2 decades in preclinical and clinical research in this field.<br>
To my delight, soon after joining Sangamo nearly 20 months ago, I learned that the science here is even better than I expected. It has remarkable<br>technology. And it's second standard for what therapeutic genome editing should be, precise, efficient, specific. We are delighted that when Kite<br>came looking for an editing partner, they chose Sangamo and that they chose zinc fingers. And we are equally pleased to our search for an optimal<br>collaborator in oncology has brought us to Kite because we sought a partner with the financial strength and clear determination to win. No other<br>company is investing as heavily to bring the new products forward. This collaboration fits very nicely with our strategy to partner technology for<br>applications that require special expertise or resources.<br>
Oncology is an incredibly competitive therapeutic area, and genome editing is just one of the several important inputs into these new cellular<br>therapies. We believe the dedication of Kite to this space greatly increases the probability of success for the development, commercialization of<br>zinc finger nucleases across a range of products in oncology.<br>
This announcement builds on the momentum of last year, in which we made significant progress, transitioning Sangamo from its previous research<br>focus to a sustainable, fully-integrated company that aims to translate cutting-edge science into genomic medicines to transform patients' lives.<br>
With new management, a clear strategy, the validation of multiple external collaborations, a strengthened balance sheet and with core values that<br>make our patients a central focus of everything we do, Sangamo is now operating with an urgency and efficiency to pursue the vast opportunities<br>presented by our technology platform.<br>
2017 was foundational. 2018 promises to be transformative. We now have 5 active clinical programs across our gene therapy, genome editing and<br>cell therapy platforms, and expect to see progress in patient enrollment across all our studies, and most importantly, efficacy data begin to read<br>out throughout the year. We recently provided a safety data updates from our MPS II clinical study at the 2018 World Symposium Congress and<br>expect preliminary efficacy data readouts from our MPS and hemophilia A clinical trials towards the first half of this year.<br>

Furthermore, we've recently strengthened our leadership team with the appointment of Heather Turner as our Senior Vice President, In-house<br>General Counsel; and Dr. Duncan McKay, our new Vice President and General Manager of Sangamo Europe, who will base in the U.K. I'm pleased<br>to welcome both Heather and Duncan to Sangamo.<br>
Heather has deep biotech experience, having worked at Cooley, and also as an in-house general counsel for the last 15 years. She will help us<br>tremendously, as we advance to the late-stage development and on to commercialization.<br>
And as we establish our footprint in Europe and plan the strategic expansion of clinical development and other operations abroad, Duncan's role<br>is critical to execution of our 2018 goals. He's already begun planning for our clinical operations in the U.K., and we're working closely with Ed on<br>European clinical trial initiation for MPS and hemophilia B. I've known Duncan for more than 20 years and worked with him closely during much<br>of that time. He knows the industry well and is someone who just gets things done.<br>
I'll now turn the call over to Curt, who will discuss in greater detail our newly announced oncology collaboration with Kite and provide an overview<br>of our evolving business strategy for 2018. Curt?<br>

Thanks, Sandy, and good morning, everyone. We are excited to announce that we will work with Kite, a Gilead company, on the development of<br>new gene-edited cell therapies for cancer. Gene editing is a critical component in the development of next-generation autologous and allogeneic<br>cell therapies. Sangamo has more than a decade of experience, developing cell therapy products and translating this cutting-edge research into<br>clinical trials.<br>
As Sandy pointed out, in recent years, our technology has advanced very rapidly along the 3 critical dimensions of precision, efficiency and specificity.<br>We are now able to rapidly assemble ZFNs to precisely target any nucleoside in the genome. We have increased our ex vivo on-target efficiency<br>to consistently above 90%. We have learned to engineer away nonspecific binding between the ZFN and the DNA, reducing off-target cleavage<br>to below undetectable levels. This unique profile is being recognized by partners as setting the standard for what good looks like in terms of<br>therapeutic genome editing. It enabled the recent gene regulation collaboration with Pfizer for C9ORF-linked ALS and frontotemporal lobar<br>degeneration, and it was certainly recognized by Kite in the optimal way to gene edit cell therapies for cancer.<br>
After careful consideration, we determined that building an oncology business requires specialized and dedicated expertise and that patients will<br>be best served by Sangamo lining ourselves with a leading partner in the oncology field with the resources, relationships and capabilities to advance<br>new therapies rapidly into global development and commercialization.<br>
With the Kite collaboration, we believe we are working with the company most committed to transforming the space of new cell therapies and<br>oncology. And we think this collaboration will optimally benefit both patients living with cancer and the use of Sangamo technology within this<br>field. We are also excited that Kite, after publicly stating their interest in partnering with the gene-editing company, made the active choice of zinc<br>fingers and Sangamo for the next generation of cell therapy and oncology.<br>
We are pleased with the scope in the strong financial terms. Kite is paying Sangamo $150 million upfront to gain an exclusive license for the use<br>of ZFNs for gene editing of T-cells and NK, or natural killer cells to create CAR-T, TCR and NKR products in oncology. We are eligible to receive over<br>$3 billion in milestone payments, that is $300 million per product in development, regulatory, first commercial sale and commercial sales milestone<br>payments for 10 or more products. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of future products resulting from the collaboration.<br>
All Sangamo internal FTE and external passthrough expenses under the oncology research plan will be reimbursed by Kite. Sangamo will be<br>primarily responsible for developing and optimizing the cell therapy genome editing process, including delivering ZFNs to knock out specific target<br>genes and AAVs to deliver CARs, TCRs and NKRs for autologous and allogeneic T-cell and NK cell products.<br>
Sangamo has significant know-how from its prior experience in building genome-edited cell therapies and will be leveraging this expertise with<br>the goal of helping Kite build best-in-class products for patients living with liquid and solid tumor cancers.<br>

<A name=402></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:00PM, SGMO - Q4 2017 Sangamo Therapeutics Inc Earnings Call<br>
All of this experience can be directly translated to Sangamo's strategy and product development efforts in cell therapy outside of the oncology<br>field and this was a critical aspect of the collaboration.<br>
This is an important day for the evolution of Sangamo's business. We are executing on our stated strategy to externalize product development in<br>highly competitive markets, such as hematology, where specialized expertise, capabilities and resources are required to become competitive such<br>as in oncology. We will continue to collaborate and externalize product development rights along these criteria and expect, in the future, to strike<br>additional partnerships across both the in vivo area in different tissue types and the ex vivo cell therapy area for different therapeutic cell types of<br>interest.<br>
Turning to Slide 12, we plan to retain and build out our own therapeutic area of businesses in rare inherited metabolic disorders, such as MPS I,<br>MPS II and Fabry disease, where we believe we will have differentiated treatments and where the commercial strategy will involve serving patients<br>through specialized centers of excellence focused on these indications. We are also evaluating forward integration around other opportunities<br>where we may be able to develop a significant, competitive and technical advantage, such as genome-edit cell therapy for autoimmune disorders,<br>a promising field that is still emerging similar to where immuno-oncology was a few short years ago, and precisely, where we can leverage our<br>deep experience and know-how.<br>
These are exciting times and we are thrilled to be working in therapeutic areas where the understanding of the genetics and biology is improving<br>rapidly and we have the optimal genomic toolkit to build great products for patients in need.<br>
Overall, we believe this diverse therapeutic area and diversified product strategy creates significant long-term value by enabling the broad<br>development of therapeutic applications made possible by the zinc finger platform. It also allows us to build valuable business franchises ourselves,<br>such as the previously mentioned inherited metabolic disorders and the emerging ex vivo genome-edited cell therapy in nononcology indications,<br>such as autoimmune.<br>
Very importantly, for Sangamo, it is also consistent with our fundamental core values and getting the technology out there and in the right hands,<br>which compels us to urgently develop new genomic medicines to change the lives of patients.<br>
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Kathy Yi, for a summary of our 2017 financial results. Kathy?<br>
<b>Kathy Y. Yi</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO<br>
Thank you, Kurt. Good morning, everyone. Detailed financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 were included in the press release we<br>issued earlier this morning. They are summarized on Slide 15. I will briefly review the most important components of our financials today, and we'll<br>focus on primary drivers of our growth and spending for 2018.<br>
We ended the fourth quarter with a strong balance sheet with $244.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. The total net loss for the<br>fourth quarter of 2017 was $13.1 million or $0.15 per share compared with $9.6 million or $0.14 per share for the same period in 2016.<br>
Turning to today's announcement on the oncology collaboration agreement. This deal with Kite is significant from both financial and strategic<br>considerations. It provides incremental cash of $150 million to further invest in new therapeutic areas beyond our current pipeline with fully funded<br>R&amp;D and manufacturing costs for oncology programs.<br>
As discussed earlier by Sandy and Kurt, we believe there are also tremendous opportunities for independent value creation in cell therapies outside<br>of oncology, such as autoimmune disorders.<br>
In addition to investing in these new therapeutic areas, we intend to expand our clinical operations into Europe and build out our own GMP<br>manufacturing capability in our new headquarter -- corporate headquarters in, Brisbane, California. Therefore, we expect a directional increase in<br>R&amp;D, clinical and manufacturing expenses, and also in G&amp;A, as our organization grows to support expansion of our pipeline.<br>

<A name=403></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:00PM, SGMO - Q4 2017 Sangamo Therapeutics Inc Earnings Call<br>
We end the year with $244.6 million, and since then, have received $12 million of funds from Pfizer. Once the Kite collaboration receives HSR<br>clearance, we will receive an additional $150 million. We expect our cash resources will last into the second half of 2020. We will provide additional<br>color and updated financial guidance in the next earnings call, as we incorporate the impact of the oncology deal.<br>
Our balance sheet is very strong as we enter this exciting next phase of Sangamo's growth. We have significant potential, corporate and clinical<br>catalysts this year and next, including expected proof-of-concept data from 7 genome editing, gene therapy and cell therapy clinical trials. Over<br>the next few years, we will continue to advance new programs toward IND. While we plan to retain some programs to take forward ourselves, our<br>strategy will also continue to include partnerships for certain programs, which may provide additional potentially significant sources of upfront<br>cash and milestone payments in the future.<br>
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ed for clinical update.<br>
<b>Edward R. Conner</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; Chief Medical Officer<br>
Thank you, Kathy, and good morning to everyone on the call. We expect 2018 to be a very exciting year for Sangamo's clinical team, with data<br>readouts from our lead programs expected throughout the year. We now have 5 clinical programs, and I'd like to begin by reviewing recent progress<br>from our 3 clinical-stage, in vivo, genome-editing programs in MPS I, MPS II and hemophilia B, starting with the CHAMPIONS MPS II clinical study<br>for SB-913.<br>
This is a dose-ascending study, enrolling up to 9 adults with attenuated MPS II into 3 dose cohorts. As a quick reminder, our gene-editing programs<br>use our zinc finger nuclease technology to target a precise position in the DNA just downstream of the albumin promoter in liver cells to create a<br>space to allow for insertion of new DNA as shown on Slide 17.<br>
In the case of MPS II, this new DNA codes for IDS, the enzyme deficient in MPS II patients. The goal then is to have liver cells produce a steady and<br>consistent level of enzyme, which circulates throughout the body, enters into cells and performs its normal functions for the lifetime of the patient.<br>
Turning to Slide 18. As Sandy mentioned, we presented preliminary safety data on the first subject in the CHAMPIONS study at the World Symposium<br>in San Diego in early February. As of December 27, the subject has shown no drug-related severe adverse events and their liver function tests<br>remained within the normal range. To date, 2 subjects have been treated in the first dose cohort and the infusion of a dose of 5.00E+12 vg/kg of<br>SB-913 appears to be safe and well tolerated. We expect to dose the next patient early next month.<br>
For our MPS I program using SB-318 on Slide 19, we currently have 5 sites open and we have 2 patients in screening who have passed initial lab<br>assessments. Other patients are advancing through the screening process. I expect patient enrollment to advance steadily throughout 2018 and<br>that we will have initial data from this program this year.<br>
If you recall, on our third quarter call last November, we discussed our focus on enrollment of pediatric patients, the patient population where we<br>believe medical need is greatest for our therapies. We will include adolescents and children in the current Phase I/II studies once we have collected<br>appropriate safety data in adults. We will expand enrollments in these studies to Europe where EU authorities encouraged us to file a CTA for<br>pediatric studies.<br>
Moving on to Slide 20. Our hemophilia B program<br>
(technical difficulty)<br>
continues to be a challenge to enroll. We are in the process of initiating 2 additional study sites in the U.S. as well as expanding enrollment to<br>Europe. The CTA for this study was filed at the beginning of the year and we expect to activate sites in the U.K. and enroll patients by the end of<br>the year. I look forward to working with Duncan, our new VP and General Manager of Sangamo Europe, to initiate the study arms in adolescent<br>and pediatric patients in the U.K. and begin enrollment there across the MPS I, MPS II and hemophilia B programs.<br>

<A name=404></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:00PM, SGMO - Q4 2017 Sangamo Therapeutics Inc Earnings Call<br>
Turning to Slide 22 to our hemophilia A clinical program, SB-525, being developed in collaboration with Pfizer. SB-525 is based on our AAV cDNA<br>gene therapy approach to deliver a functional copy of the Factor VIII gene to the nucleus of liver cells. We currently have 8 sites open for the trials<br>and 3 patients dosed so far with another to be dosed shortly. We expect to release top line efficacy data from the SB-525 programs at the Scientific<br>Meeting some time in mid-2018.<br>
Next, a quick update from our ST-400 Phase I/II clinical program for beta-thalassemia on Slide 24. Our ST-400 cell therapy candidate is a differentiated<br>approach to treating beta-thalassemia, mimicking naturally-occurring genetic variance in the human body to boost fetal hemoglobin expression.<br>The manufacturing of ST-400 involves ex vivo nonviral mRNA delivery of ZFNs, a potential strategic advantage of a randomly integrating<br>lentiviral-based approaches currently being developed.<br>
The first site for the ST-400 study will be initiated soon. The study is designed to enroll a total of 6 patients, all to be treated with the same dose.<br>We expect to enroll the first patient in the second quarter of this year. Subsequent patients can undergo apheresis while prior patients are enrolled<br>and cell product is being manufactured. We do this to ensure the shortest possible enrollment time between patients.<br>
I would like to reiterate our strategy for rolling out clinical data from our ongoing clinical trials. Rather than release efficacy data on a per-patient<br>basis, our plan is to release data once it has matured with appropriate post-treatment follow-up time, so that we may disclose data we believe to<br>be both clinically meaningful and reliable.<br>
To close, I'm pleased with the progress our clinical team has made in 2017 and very excited about the prospects of accelerating our genome-editing<br>studies into the pediatric patient populations. We remain on track with our clinical milestones for 2018, and I look forward to preliminary data<br>readouts from our hemophilia A and MPS II studies in the next few months.<br>
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Holmes, our Head of Research. Mike?<br>
<b>Michael Holmes</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - VP of Research<br>
Thanks, Ed, and good morning. I want to take this opportunity to state how proud I am to see the hard work and achievements made by Sangamo's<br>R&amp;D teams being recognized with important collaborations exemplified by today's Kite announcements as well as the C9ORF72 and hemophilia<br>A deals with Pfizer.<br>
I've been at Sangamo now 17 years, focused on the development of our zinc finger protein base, genome editing and gene regulation platforms<br>for the treatment of patients with significant unmet medical needs. Our technology has progressed over my tenure. In the last few years, it has<br>advanced by leaps and bounds.<br>
I'm extremely proud of our team -- of our -- of how our team continues to lead this field and the strong validation that our work has received recently<br>from external parties. And I just want to stop here and say it's truly incredible what we've accomplished, especially over the last 12 months, and<br>that these advancements are a result of the innovative and collaborative effort of our R&amp;D teams.<br>
With that, I want to bring attention to a few of our scientists, who -- whose teams have contributed to these collaborations. Ed Rebar's team for<br>the enhanced architectures, which we have recently begun to sketch, which allow for the rapid generation of highly precise, efficient and specific<br>zinc fingers. Gary Lee and his team for their exciting improvements in ZFN-mediated T-cell multiplex editing for next-generation CAR-T and TCR<br>cell therapies. Bryan Zeitler's group for their recent work in gene regulation for CNS diseases that set the foundation for the C9ORF72 partnership.<br>And Brigit Riley, for establishing a potentially best-in-class gene therapy approach for hemophilia A, which demonstrated the diversification of<br>Sangamo's technical capabilities in the gene therapy and led to the first partnership with Pfizer last year.<br>
Turning to Slide 26. In the liver, where we've focused our in vivo genome editing and gene therapy approaches to treat rare diseases requiring<br>protein replacement. Our Fabry disease gene therapy program, ST-920, advances towards the clinic. We are currently completing the preclinical<br>data package, including a study in nonhuman primates and remain on track to submit the IND application to the FDA later this year.<br>

<A name=405></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:00PM, SGMO - Q4 2017 Sangamo Therapeutics Inc Earnings Call<br>
Turning to Slide 29. At the Keystone Symposia meeting on emerging cellular therapies earlier this month, Sangamo presented data demonstrating<br>highly efficient, multiplex gene editing in human T-cells with ZFNs. Multiplex editing is the ability to make multiple genetic changes in a single<br>step and is critical for the development of next-generation cellular therapies to treat liquid and solid tumors in cancer. It enables simultaneous<br>knockout of certain genes to prevent the body from rejecting the treatment and knocking the mutant genes to equip the modified T-cells with<br>targeted antitumor functions.<br>
Sangamo scientist, Sumiti Jain, presented recent work in which we performed 4 edits simultaneously, all at greater than 90% efficiency resulting<br>in 76% of modified cells containing all 4 edits. In addition to preparing to work closely with our new partner to accelerate Kite's development of<br>new cell therapies in oncology, Gary and his team are now exploring how to leverage our gene-edited cell therapy expertise into other therapeutic<br>areas outside of oncology where we'll obtain full rights, including autoimmune diseases, a promising area where cell therapy research is just<br>beginning.<br>
Another key therapeutic area we are focused on involves combining our ZFP-TF gene regulation platform with novel AAVs engineered across the<br>blood-brain barrier in order to deliver ZFP-TF broadly to CNS and regulate target gene expressions.<br>
Turning to Slide 31. We've initiated our C9ORF72 program for ALS with Pfizer. In this program, we used ZFP-TF to distinguish the mutant allele from<br>wild type and to selectively downregulate the expression of the mutant form of the gene. Also, on our gene regulation work, we've been exploring<br>the ability of ZFP-TFs to identify and downregulate expression of tau, an area that is increasingly receiving interest in the scientific, medical and<br>pharmaceutical research community.<br>
This year, we are continuing our preclinical work in this program testing the safety and tolerability, and also the efficiency and specificity of our<br>ZFP-TFs in novel AAVs and nonhuman primates. We've completed the initial pilot studies in monkeys and the treatment was well tolerated. The<br>results of these in other follow-on nonhuman primate studies will read out later this year.<br>
In closing, I want to reiterate what a remarkable time this is for Sangamo research. The labs are buzzing with excitement and energy, as we see our<br>work create value for the company and our collaborations and in programs entering the clinic. I'll now turn the call back over to Sandy.<br>
<b>Alexander D. Macrae</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thank you, Mike. These are indeed exciting times in the field of genome medicine and gene therapy, and especially, at Sangamo. We're thrilled to<br>partner with Kite for oncology and believe this program will advance most quickly with the strong partners to reach the greatest number of patients.<br>That, we believe, is the right thing to do for patients and for shareholders.<br>
We are a unique company. We have a history that extends back more than 2 decades. A history that includes many first in this field, the first to edit<br>cells in vitro, the first to treat a patient with ex vivo-edited cells, the first to infuse a patient with an in vivo genome-editing treatment.<br>
We're very proud of this history, and also believe that it's a firm foundation on to which to build the Sangamo of the future. From our experience,<br>we have a deep knowledge of our field and have developed a diversified platform with nearly limitless possibilities. It's such an exciting time in<br>genomic medicine and a thrilling time to be at Sangamo. Thank you.<br>
Operator, we are now ready for questions.<br>

<b>Charles Cliff Duncan</b> - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
And secondly, congratulations on...<br>
(technical difficulty)<br>
transaction with Kite. So question for you, Sandy or Curt. I guess, this is almost a silly question, but can you provide us a little bit more color on the<br>diligence process? And whether or not that deal with Kite was a competitive thing? Were they considering other technologies?<br>
<b>Alexander D. Macrae</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I'm delighted too. Because as you can imagine, over the past 6 months with Kite becoming part of the Gilead family, it's been a fascinating process,<br>and truly, a competitive one. Curt, do you want to give some color on that?<br>
<b>Curt A. Herberts</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; Chief Business Officer<br>
Sure. Charles, it's a great question. So I think as publicly stated by both Kite and Gilead and John and Norbert at Gilead, they scoured the field. A<br>lot of the data that our team has been working on and publicly presenting, including Gary Lee as well as Sumiti, really has been best-in-class in<br>terms of trying to look at multiplex genome editing for target knockout as well as target insertion. So we're very excited about the overall process.<br>
<b>Alexander D. Macrae</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
And Gilead, as you know, has got a reputation for doing really important transactions and choosing carefully where they invest. So it's like pleasing<br>the Sangamo that they partnered with.<br>
<b>Charles Cliff Duncan</b> - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
Yes. I imagine it's been a rigorous process. So congrats to you on that transaction. I guess, I'm wondering when would you anticipate the first<br>opportunity to gauge progress on your selection of a candidate? Or what that might mean out of that collaboration?<br>
<b>Curt A. Herberts</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; Chief Business Officer<br>
Yes. Great question, Charles, and we expected those. So we're going to let Kite take the first shot of that. But what we can tell you is there are some<br>specific programs that we're working on.<br>

the oncology field, knows what oncologists and patients need and want. We give -- we bring a lot of technical experience to that and so can help<br>them in the selection, but this will be driven by Kite/Gilead.<br>
<b>Maurice Thomas Raycroft</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Got it. And second, just to clarify, this is for CAR Ts, TCRs and NK cell receptors. So this leaves you with B-cells, dendritic cells and other immune cell<br>types to edit. I'm wondering if you can talk about the potential for those other immune cell types, particularly in autoimmune disease and maybe<br>in other indications too? And I'm wondering if you'd still have the option to edit B-cells in oncology indications?<br>
<b>Alexander D. Macrae</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
So let me get 2 different answers or 2 similar answers, complementary answers for this. Curt, can you talk about the deal terms? And Mike, can you<br>talk about where this takes us? So Curt?<br>
<b>Curt A. Herberts</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; Chief Business Officer<br>
Sure. Absolutely. So you're right. It's focused on -- in terms of the cell types both T-cells as well as NK cells, and then you mentioned all the right<br>target moieties, the CARs, the TCRs, and the NKRs. And that is all within the focus of oncology.<br>
So outside of those cell types and outside of those targeting moieties, basically, we have the freedom to operate there. Mike can talk about other<br>cell types and other therapeutic areas of interest.<br>
<b>Michael Holmes</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - VP of Research<br>
Right, so happy to. And sort of hopefully, I'm providing a complementary answer where -- I think this leaves open where we can edit other<br>hematopoietic cells and you certainly raise all the important ones that include T-cells and B-cells as well as other types of blood cell types that you<br>see for other non-oncology indications, such as autoimmune diseases and in infectious disease. So I think this really leaves open a variety of areas<br>for us to move into. And certainly, we will be providing more details in further calls.<br>
<b>Alexander D. Macrae</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
And Maury, the way I thought about it or the teams thought about it when we constructed this deal is, we want to be absolutely clear that for<br>T-cells and NK cells and oncology, our relationship is with Gilead and Kite and they will make this successful. But because of our experience in HIV<br>and our ex vivo editing capability, it opens up a whole universe of other cell types for other indications and allow Sangamo, both to partner and<br>to drive something forward ourselves, which is the essence of who we are.<br>

<A name=409></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:00PM, SGMO - Q4 2017 Sangamo Therapeutics Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Curt A. Herberts</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; Chief Business Officer<br>
So it's a great question. What we've disclosed in 8-K is escalating tier growth repayments that are not double digits, so it's on the single digit and<br>that's extends between the 2 companies, so we can't say any more.<br>
<b>Gena Wang</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Okay, okay. And also, within how many years does Kite have to choose all these 10 products?<br>
<b>Curt A. Herberts</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; Chief Business Officer<br>
So again, that -- there is a specified research term under the collaboration, but I don't believe we've disclosed that in the 8-K.<br>
<b>Alexander D. Macrae</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
But to be more humanly positive about this, we've already started to talk about what the targets are. We already have people at Sangamo, who<br>are planning how to do this, and so this deal will happen -- the consequence of this deal will happen very quickly. And this is a field and we need<br>to -- both Sangamo and Kite, Gilead, need to get going on this problem.<br>
<b>Gena Wang</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Okay, I think that makes sense. And then regarding the ongoing clinical programs, just wondering for the hem A program, you already dosed the<br>third patient. Can you tell us which dose did the third patient receive?<br>
<b>Michael Holmes</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - VP of Research<br>
So we're not disclosing the dose information at this time. We will be looking to release our efficacy and safety data at a conference midyear in 2018.<br>
<b>Gena Wang</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Okay. Will we be able to see data from more than 4 patients for the hem A program, mid -- probably mid...<br>
<b>Michael Holmes</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - VP of Research<br>
It will depend on the timing of enrollment.<br>
<b>Gena Wang</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And also quick question regarding the MPS II. So the midyear update, will you also report some biomarker data such as urine GAG reduction?<br>
<b>Michael Holmes</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - VP of Research<br>
Yes. The data that we would expect to report would be the IDS activity levels in the serum as well as urine GAGs.<br>

<b>Gena Wang</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Okay, okay. And then lastly, very quick question regarding the cell therapy, allogeneic cell therapy multiplexed genome-editing data. Just wanted<br>to confirm the editing efficiency mentioned in the slides, are these biallelic editing?<br>
<b>Curt A. Herberts</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; Chief Business Officer<br>
Mike, you want to comment on that?<br>
<b>Michael Holmes</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - VP of Research<br>
Yes. No. So certainly, the frequencies that are recorded here are total amounts of -- total number of alleles modified. But as you can see, that as you<br>are approaching numbers that are getting close to 100%, it is starting to achieve a point where it's also reporting on the number of cells that are<br>biallelically modified.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And the next question will come from the line of Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo.<br>
<b>Yanan Zhu</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
This is Yanan in for Jim. So just first question is in terms of the targets for the gene editing for oncology purposes. I think you have reported preclinical<br>data on 4 targets in -- from your preclinical studies, including CISH, TCR, beta-2M and -- so in terms -- and in terms of the collaboration, I imagine<br>there are more targets might be involved, like the TCR approach may involve TCR other than CAR T construct. And also the NKR program probably<br>involves additional receptors. Have you had any preclinical data working on those novel -- on those targets thus far that you haven't disclosed --<br>reported?<br>
<b>Alexander D. Macrae</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
So thank you for your question. I think the best way to think about that is to step further back. The reason we and Kite and Gilead chose this<br>partnership rather than it being -- mentioning specific targets is because we all believe that there is both -- the targets are known now and targets<br>that will be developed as this field evolves at such a rapid pace. And so although the first few targets may be ones that we've all heard of, they and<br>we wanted the opportunity for us to evolve with the field to be able to choose new targets that are learned from the exploration of this very new<br>field and for Sangamo to provide editing capabilities for them, no matter what happens, whether it was checkpoint inhibitor switches, if that's<br>necessary, novel targets. So we are delighted to have a truly creative partnership rather than it being on target by target. Curt, you would agree?<br>
<b>Curt A. Herberts</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; Chief Business Officer<br>
I would agree. And the data that Sumiti and Gary have presented recently is spot on in terms of, kind of, leading the field.<br>
<b>Yanan Zhu</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Got it. That's very helpful. And also, just curious, in terms of the ability to sort cells after the genome editing process -- I was just curious what would<br>that -- capability is in terms of both positively sort-out cells and negatively sort-out cells. Just trying to get a sense because the genome editing<br>efficiency is a key parameter, but also through sorting, I think, there's another level of enrichment that can be provided.<br>

<b>Alexander D. Macrae</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Mike, can you take that.<br>
<b>Michael Holmes</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - VP of Research<br>
No. Certainly, I'm happy to take this one. As we've talked about, in our recent presentations, the levels of editing are approaching 99% or higher.<br>So in some sense, we know we can achieve levels of editing that may not really require any type of sorting or purification after the fact.<br>
And so, obviously, we are not at this point able to go into detail, but well I think that is a possibility, and certainly, the levels of editing that we're<br>seeing right now, it wouldn't require much in the way of enrichment to really achieve a 100% of the population being edited.<br>
<b>Yanan Zhu</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Got it. And also, for that program, is the approach remaining to be mRNA delivery for a number of targets, and then combined with AAV delivery<br>for the CAR T construct, for example, a 2-delivery approach?<br>
<b>Michael Holmes</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - VP of Research<br>
Right. So I think, all the work that we've shown, has involved the use of ZFN mRNA delivery in the T-cells combined with AAV delivery of the donor.<br>And that has certainly achieved best-in-class levels of genome editing. And certainly, we would see, for the foreseeable future, to keep with that<br>type of delivery modality.<br>
<b>Yanan Zhu</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
I see. Last question. You mentioned potential areas in autoimmune diseases. I think that we've heard mainly something on Tregs, for example, that<br>could be potentially an area for genome editing. Could you characterize the landscape for that field and the general progress that's being made<br>in that field?<br>
<b>Michael Holmes</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - VP of Research<br>
Yes, I don't think I can probably, at this point in time, summarize the field with regards to Tregs and other cell types that people are using for<br>autoimmunity. Tregs is certainly one. The field has also looked at cell types, such as mesenchymal stem cells as ways to use their natural properties<br>to suppress the immune system. And certainly, you can see that the field is really looking at the potential for genome editing to further enhance,<br>and retarget these different cells to try and further reduce or suppress the activity of immune system to recognize self-antigens.<br>
And so this is something that we'll obviously be talking about more in subsequent calls, but this is based off of our expertise in oncology as well<br>as all the previous work in HIV. We're, certainly, looking at how we can leverage what we built so far in building this best-in-class genome-editing<br>technology to move into areas, such as autoimmune diseases.<br>
<b>Alexander D. Macrae</b> - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
And we've got -- I'd like to say we've got a great team and Gary and Sumiti and the team, and we just need to apply them to the next big problem.<br>So exciting times. But thank you for your questions.<br>

<A name=415></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, RDFN.OQ - Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thanks, Elena, and hi, everyone. Redfin's year-over-year market share gains continued to accelerate in the fourth quarter, and our revenues exceeded<br>the range we gave you last November. More importantly, we invested in fundamental improvements to our customer service while reducing our<br>loss from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017.<br>
Our fourth quarter revenue was $95.8 million, an increase of 43% over the fourth quarter of 2016. A more fair comparison excludes new businesses<br>to consider only the sales through our own agents and our partner agents. These revenues were up 36% over the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding<br>revenue from new businesses is especially important because our new experimental service for buying homes outright from consumers, Redfin<br>Now, counts the entire sale price of a home as revenue, even though our gain on the sale is only a tiny fraction of that price. Our first Redfin Now<br>sales closed in the second quarter of 2017.<br>
We still lost money for the quarter and the year. While this was by design, we have to soberly account in this call for what we're buying with those<br>losses: technologies to make our brokerage better, faster and more efficient; new products to broaden our customer appeal; new businesses to<br>give each customer more value. I've never worked so long in a business where there are still so many ways for it to grow.<br>
The most important measure of our performance is our customer satisfaction. In a November 2017 survey of nearly 2,000 Americans who worked<br>with an agent over the past year to buy or sell a home, Redfin's net promoter score was 52% higher than traditional agents. A net promoter score<br>is a measure of customer satisfaction. This was the fifth consecutive survey in which Redfin's customer satisfaction was higher than our competitors.<br>
Our market share by home value was 0.71% in the fourth quarter, the same as in the third quarter, but a gain of 0.15 percentage points over the<br>fourth quarter of 2016. Year-over-year share gains accelerated steadily throughout 2017 from 0.10 percentage points in the first quarter to 0.11 in<br>the second, 0.14 in the third and now 0.15 in the fourth quarter. We believe that share is the best measure of our competitive position because it<br>excludes the housing market's ups and downs.<br>
As we predicted in our last 2 earnings calls, traffic growth moderated in the fourth quarter, mostly because our audience has become so large in<br>absolute terms. But redfin.com continued to be the U.S.'s fastest-growing real estate website. Our year-over-year growth in online visitors was 33%<br>in the fourth quarter compared to 38% in the third quarter. We expect strong traffic growth in 2018 but with percentage gains continuing to<br>moderate. Beyond 2018, we believe our traffic growth will come from the 77 markets that Redfin opened less than 10 years ago, from Google<br>searches on real estate terms where we haven't been competitive before and, as Redfin becomes more well known for listing search, from more<br>people bypassing Google to come directly to our site. We also expect that our business will depend less on our growth as a listing search site and<br>more on our growth as a brokerage, with gains in repeat customers continuing to accelerate and more people coming to Redfin for on-demand<br>home tours and lower fees.<br>
More advertising is also likely to contribute to our growth. As our conviction deepens that we offer the best service, we want America to know<br>about it. In the fourth quarter, we prepared the most comprehensive marketing campaign in Redfin's history, with our first major radio and billboard<br>ads both promoting our 1% listing fee. To illustrate the power of on-demand home tours, we also developed a new TV ad that shows a couple<br>instantly moving from one listing to another via magic doors activated by our mobile application. Starting February 5, these ads began to run in<br>more than a dozen U.S. cities.<br>
Beyond traditional media, we plan to continue drawing on our unique data about which online visitors actually buy or sell a home. This will let us<br>make better investments than we believe any broker can in online video, search engine ads, retargeting and other digital media.<br>
Finding advertising channels that we can profitably spend lots of money on continues to be a strategic priority for Redfin. Most of our potential<br>customers still don't know about us. In November 2017, we asked thousands of people buying or selling a home in long-established Redfin markets<br>to name their top 3 real estate websites. Less than 1 in 3 named redfin.com. When asked to name top 3 brokerage, less than 1 in 10 named Redfin,<br>even in markets where we've run TV ads for 3 years. One of the only reasons we may defer improving profits every year is to spend more on ads.<br>We spent 20% of 2017 gross profits on advertising placements, but if we find a winning formula, in 1 year, we might spend nearly double that<br>percentage to get our name out there. Those ads aren't going to be immediately profitable, given that it typically takes 6 months to buy a home<br>

once you engage an agent and that many of the people who see an ad will be years away from moving. No mass-market advertising is going to<br>pay for itself the year it runs. Even if an ad doesn't bring us enough customers to immediately offset its expense, our bet would be that we'd benefit<br>from the increased awareness for years to come.<br>
Over time, our ad spending would grow much more slowly than our business, likely returning to between 10% and 20% of gross profits. But if this<br>increased awareness accelerated listing share gains, it could create a virtuous cycle with yard signs reinforcing other forms of advertising.<br>
Already, we've seen evidence that we may be able to create this virtuous cycle in Seattle, where we have a hometown advantage but also the<br>highest listing share. Nearly 1 in 5 Seattle real estate consumers named Redfin as the top 3 brokerage, which is double the rate of our next best<br>market and significantly higher than it was 6 months ago. We'll have data from our 2018 campaign across many markets by August, and we'll let<br>you know if Seattle's awareness gains hold up and broaden to other markets.<br>
For homebuyers, the simplest benefit we can tell in our ads and on our site is speed by instantly scheduling home tours, and we're getting faster.<br>We updated our scheduling software so that we could automatically find the time for an agent to meet a customer on 83 -- excuse me, 83% of our<br>December home tours, up from 68% in September. Confirming a tour request without any phone calls between coordinators, agents and customers<br>lets us capture more would-be customers with less work. Just as a retailer increases revenues through elaborate systems to get the right products<br>to the right shelves, we've worked for years to ensure the right Redfin agent is available for each customer at the right time.<br>
The next step for us is rapidly confirming the availability of the listings the customer wants to tour. Typically, the buyer's agent calls the seller's<br>agent to see if the owner can get the house ready for a showing. But starting in the third quarter, Redfin began using a combination of software<br>and call center employees to do this more quickly and efficiently. By the last week of December, we confirmed 9% of home tours without requiring<br>a Redfin buyer's agent to do anything except show up. A major 2018 focus will be confirming listing availability for nearly all tours. Our goal over<br>time is to convey a competitive advantage, not just to Redfin, but to our homebuying customers, who should never have to wait on an agent to<br>see a hot listing.<br>
This commitment to speed is why we've also invested in our own offer writing software, which lets our agents put together a bid on a listing in a<br>few minutes. In the fourth quarter, we expanded the markets the software supports from Chicago, D.C. and Virginia to Maryland. The localization<br>involved for each market is extensive. Different states, counties and cities require different offer forms, and local customs around earnest money<br>amounts and other deal terms require different default values for the forms field.<br>
In Maryland alone, we have to support 30 addenda. For these reasons, it will take us years to adapt our offer writing software to every major U.S.<br>market. But as we do, we believe we'll be able to move faster than any other broker at lower cost and with comprehensive data about what it takes<br>to win in each neighborhood.<br>
Even as we automate the opening and closing stages of the homebuying process, we're investing in more personal service during the long search<br>in between to give our homebuying customers more guidance on how to win in an increasingly competitive market. As we discussed in our last<br>earnings call, we want shareholders to understand this investment, which is a bet that spending more on our service could not only lead to happier<br>homebuyers and more sales but ultimately to more gross profits per sale. For that bet to pay off, we'll have to buck an increasingly competitive<br>market. When home prices rose in the last boom, easy lending standards and lots of new construction let homebuyers keep up, but now that the<br>market is so much tighter, our job as agents is to work harder at finding a way for each homebuying customer to win.<br>
Over the years, the number of customers that a Redfin agent has met in order to generate 1 sale has varied widely as we've made changes to our<br>service, which tells us that what we do can increase or decrease our customers' rate of success. And since most of the customers our agents spend<br>time with don't end up buying a home with us, we know that any improvements in our customer success rate can save our agents plenty of time.<br>The stakes for customers are even higher as our service can be the difference between winning or losing a house. In an industry where referrals<br>and repeat sales are so important, we believe the only way to be America's most successful brokerage is to have the most successful customers.<br>
Our investments in personal service began in the third quarter of 2017, with modest agent hiring in a season when we usually hire no agents<br>whatsoever. But then in the fourth quarter, we developed an entire program for asking agents to meet homebuying customers more often and to<br>

give those customers more substantive data-driven advice. Coming into 2018, Redfin plans to lower the number of homebuying customers each<br>Redfin agent supports by 10%, hiring more Redfin agents than we would have in 2017. The ratio of customers to agents will still be slightly lower<br>than it was in 2016, a year when our buyers' agents were nonetheless more productive than in 2017. If this new level of personal service doesn't<br>make our customers more successful in 2018, agent productivity and profit per transaction will decline.<br>
But the dwindling number of homes for sale notwithstanding, we have reason to believe our 2018 homebuyers will in fact be more successful. In<br>2012, when the market first swung sharply in sellers' favor, reducing the number of buyers supported by each Redfin agent increased our customer<br>success rates. We saw the same correlation in 2017. The agents who served fewer customers had higher customer success rates. We've also been<br>encouraged by more recent developments, including a successful trial last fall of coffee shop strategy sessions with our customers for comparing<br>the terms of winning and losing offers.<br>
To help our agents give customers more personal service, we also upgraded our software with a new online calendar that shows an agent what's<br>going on with each of our customers this week, whether that's a home tour or negotiating deadline or a closing. Other software released in the<br>fourth quarter made it easier for Redfin agents to focus on customers who most need attention based on the customer's online search activity and<br>brokerage interactions. This lets our agents immediately see the customers who signed up for one tour with Redfin, but not a second, or which<br>customers have engaged a Redfin agent without subscribing to alerts for new listings in their price range. We developed this software using the<br>React JavaScript library, pioneered by Facebook for high-performance and easy porting from desktop browsers to native mobile applications. We<br>know of no other brokerage taking such an aggressive approach to mobile software for ensuring that on-the-go agents deliver the right service<br>to each customer. By the second quarter of this year, we'll get our first data on whether these new programs and online tools help more buyers<br>win an offer and what the effect will be on profit per sale.<br>
We're also working hard to serve home sellers better, primarily through lower prices. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, we lowered our listing<br>fee for a full-service Redfin agent from 1.5% to 1% in 18 markets -- excuse me, 18 additional markets. We offset that savings with a fee increase for<br>our homebuying customers by refunding a smaller portion of our commission as a buyer's agent. The 1% fee is now available in a total of 26 markets,<br>which accounted for 87% of 2017's brokerage transactions, but we do not expect to expand it further anytime soon as home prices are too low in<br>the remaining 60 markets for it to be viable. At the beginning of 2017, 1% pricing was available in markets that accounted for 54% of our transactions.<br>
Years of testing in Washington, D.C., then in Seattle, Chicago, Denver and San Diego have shown that this pricing increases our overall share, and<br>it's easy to see why. Sellers contractually agree to a fee in advance when hiring a seller's agent, whereas buyers have treated our commission refund<br>like the tooth fairy. They're skeptical or oblivious until discovering the money as if under their pillow only once they've closed and months after<br>meeting their Redfin agent. The 1% fee is also easier to promote in ads and on redfin.com.<br>
We're also exploring other ways customers can benefit from our efficiency by experimenting with a level of service that we believe no brokerage<br>has been able to consistently deliver before at a fee that is still lower than the commission typically charged by traditional agents. We call this our<br>Redfin Concierge Service and charge a fee of 2% rather than 1% to coordinate and pay for staging and other cosmetic improvements that we<br>believe can increase the final sales price. Redfin Concierge is only available for homes expected to sell for $500,000 or more.<br>
We began testing the service in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. to see if it can broaden our customer appeal and also to determine if the 2% fee<br>covers our cost. We expect it will take at least a year to iterate on the offering and how we market and sell it and then to see how customers like it.<br>
The second experimental offering for selling our customers' houses is Redfin Now, in which Redfin buys a consumer's home outright, letting the<br>owner move on with cash in her pocket, while we try to spruce up the home to sell it at a profit. The owner typically nets less money than she would<br>by hiring a Redfin agent, but gets this money sooner with more certainty and less hassle.<br>
Redfin Now began buying homes in January 2017 and recorded our first sale in April. We've limited ourselves to affordable parts of Southern<br>California and did no more than $10 million in home purchases at any one time either on our books or under contract to be bought by Redfin. As<br>we said in our last earnings call, we're no longer divulging exact transaction counts.<br>

<A name=418></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, RDFN.OQ - Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call<br>
In the fourth quarter, we sold nearly all the homes we'd already bought before, with the remainder under contract to sell by the end of this month.<br>We also continued to get plenty of opportunities throughout last quarter to buy more. But at the same time, we experimented with paying<br>homeowners less for their homes in an effort to -- excuse me, in an effort to widen our profits on the subsequent sale. It didn't work. More homeowners<br>rejected our offers, and we bought far fewer homes in the fourth quarter of 2017 than the 19 we reported in the third quarter.<br>
In January and February, we're now paying slightly more for Redfin Now homes and completing purchases at a brisk pace. But since we came into<br>the first quarter of 2018, with few homes to sell, we expect fewer sales. That said, it now seems likely that purchase activity will continue to accelerate.<br>So by the second or third quarter of this year, we expect to allocate $20 million rather than $10 million for purchasing homes from consumers.<br>Given our success so far at selling all the homes we've bought, we view this as an acceptable risk.<br>
We still haven't hired enough engineers and businesspeople to run Redfin Now at any scale except as an experiment, but we'll continue to run it<br>as such, evaluating each quarter, whether Redfin Now can appeal to more than 10% of would-be home sellers at prices that compensate us for our<br>risk.<br>
The other new business we wanted to update you about is Redfin Mortgage, which we launched in the first quarter of 2017, to issue loans to our<br>homebuying customers. We believe integrating a lending operation with Redfin's existing brokerage and title businesses, all running off our own<br>software, can ultimately lead to an entirely digital closing, where Redfin borrowers can compete almost like cash buyers. As with Redfin Now, we're<br>no longer disclosing exact transaction counts. But we were pleased to see loan volume increase during a season when purchase is slow. Fourth<br>quarter loan volume in Texas grew by nearly 40% over the 13 loans we closed in the third quarter, in large part because Redfin Mortgage advisers<br>worked harder to pre-approve loans faster and connect with our customers and our agents on nights and weekends, when deals usually come<br>together. We also expanded to a second state, Illinois, where we closed a few loans. And near the end of the year, we expanded to Washington,<br>D.C.<br>
And with that, I'll turn it over to Chris.<br>
<b>Chris Nielsen</b> - Redfin Corporation - CFO and Principal Financial &amp; Accounting Officer<br>
Thanks, Glenn. We finished 2017 with solid fourth quarter results that were above our guidance range. Revenue was $96 million, including a $5<br>million contribution from Redfin Now. Our revenue grew 43% year-over-year. Real estate revenue, which excludes Redfin Now, Mortgage and other<br>services, was $89 million and grew 36% year-over-year. Brokerage revenue, or revenue from home sales closed by our agents, was up 37%, driven<br>by a 34% growth in brokerage transactions. Revenue per brokerage transaction grew 2% year-over-year. We reduced our sell-side commissions to<br>1% in 18 additional markets the beginning of the fourth quarter. To offset this reduction in brokerage revenue, we reduced refunds to homebuyers,<br>doing so slightly ahead of the continued mix shift to our faster-growing listings business. Revenue from our partner agents grew 24%, driven by<br>20% growth in partner transactions and a 3% increase in revenue per partner transaction. Other segment revenue of $7.1 million was up from $1.6<br>million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This revenue includes Redfin Now sales as well as revenue from title services, mortgage originations and other<br>products. We had no revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 from Redfin Now or mortgage originations. These businesses are new.<br>
Gross profit was $29 million, up 37% year-over-year, including a very small contribution to gross profit from Redfin Now. Gross margin on the<br>combined partner and brokerage business, known as our real estate segment, was nearly flat, increasing 10 basis points from 33.4% in the fourth<br>quarter of 2016 to 33.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was driven by a 59 basis point decrease in personnel expenses, a 30 basis point decrease<br>in occupancy expenses and a 19 basis point decrease in stock-based compensation. It was partially offset by a 50 basis point increase in transaction<br>bonuses and a 33 basis point increase in tours and field events.<br>
We continued to invest in the businesses accounted for in our other segment, including Redfin Now, Mortgage and title services. We don't break<br>out the results for these businesses, but combined, they lost $524,000 in gross profit compared to a gross profit loss of $475,000 in the fourth<br>quarter of 2016.<br>
Operating expenses showed continued leverage, growing 18% year-over-year, representing 33% of revenue, down from 40% of revenue 1 year<br>ago. This reflects our continued commitment to growing our fixed costs slower than revenue, and we expect this trend to continue into 2018.<br>

<hr>
<A name=419></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, RDFN.OQ - Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call<br>
One note is that we recorded a $1.8 million expense during the fourth quarter of 2016 for a pending legal settlement.<br>
Our net loss, including stock-based compensation and depreciation, was $1.8 million, an improvement from a $5.3 million net loss in the fourth<br>quarter of 2016. The new tax regulation had no impact on our fourth quarter earnings because we currently hold a full valuation allowance against<br>our deferred tax assets and liabilities.<br>
Diluted net loss per common share was $0.02 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with an $8.08 diluted net loss per common share in the<br>fourth quarter of 2016. The prior year loss was primarily driven by the fair market value feature of our redeemable convertible preferred stock which<br>converted to common stock in connection with our IPO. Excluding the impact of the redeemable convertible preferred stock, which is now converted<br>to common stock, adjusted diluted net loss per common share for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $0.08. Adjusted diluted net loss per common<br>share included stock-based compensation.<br>
Before I move to our 2018 outlook, I'd like to briefly recap our full year 2017 performance. Our customers booked over $21 billion in real estate<br>transactions. Compared to a 5% commission, we saved our brokerage customers over $121 million. We delivered full year revenue of over $370<br>million, up 38% year-over-year and gross profit of over $111 million, up 35%. Our total operating expenses grew 21%, and net loss for the year<br>narrowed from $22.5 million in 2016 to $15.0 million in 2017.<br>
Now turning to our financial expectations for the first quarter of 2018. Revenue is expected to be between $74.6 million and $78.4 million, representing<br>year-over-year growth between 25% and 31%. We expect Redfin Now to account for $2.3 million to $3.1 million of total revenue. Net loss is expected<br>to be between $38.7 million and $35.9 million compared with a $28.1 million net loss in the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, our losses are<br>seasonal, driven in part by the timing of our revenue. From 2015 to 2017, between 15.4% and 16.2% of our full year revenue came in the first quarter.<br>And March is, by far, the largest month of the first quarter given the seasonal ramp. It's also the month that we have the least revenue visibility to<br>as we speak today. This guidance includes approximately $4.5 million of stock-based compensation and $1.8 million of depreciation and amortization.<br>It assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements are concluded and that<br>there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates.<br>
And with that, we will open up to your questions.<br>

(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.<br>
<b>Jason Stuart Helfstein</b> - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Internet Analyst<br>
Fully understand the comments around productivity for 2018, but can you give us some more color around what type of assumptions you're making<br>for turnover in the first quarter? Do you -- are you assuming it gets worse and then just overall outlook? And to the extent that you have figured<br>out that there's a productivity -- or that you could increase your clients' success rate with more support, how are you seeing the rest of the industry<br>reactions? Obviously, buyer conversion rate is far down in this environment.<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Jason, this is Glenn. I just wanted to make sure I understood your question. Were you asking about turnover in agents?<br>

<A name=420></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, RDFN.OQ - Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Jason Stuart Helfstein</b> - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Internet Analyst<br>
No, no, no. Housing turnover, housing sales, the macro.<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Understood. So we expect inventory to continue to decline and that the market will continue to get more competitive, as I said in the prepared<br>remarks. We do think, though, that we can increase close rate modestly over the next 12 months. And the reason we think that is that every time<br>we've made a change like this in the past, we've had a similar effect. So if you look at cohorts of agents who had fewer customers in 2017, you see<br>that those agents closed at a higher rate, even if you look in markets where inventory was extremely low. If you look at years where it was also a<br>strong seller's market, but we limited the number of customers each agent met, we saw higher close rates. So I think this is going to have a positive<br>impact on close rate. What isn't understood is how positive that will be. So the market is going to work against us, and we're just going to fight the<br>tide.<br>
<b>Jason Stuart Helfstein</b> - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Internet Analyst<br>
And then do you have -- maybe share your -- are you willing to share any technology road map of additional products coming out that can help<br>agent productivity, in addition to what you said in the prepared remarks?<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, we try to understand that in 2 different ways. There are ways to save agents' time and then there are ways to increase close rate. And most<br>of our labor-saving software is really focused on the support staff because those folks are performing a high number of repetitive tasks where we<br>can either automate it or simplify it so that we can take $10, $20, $50, $100 out of the deal by just having fewer support staff per agent. But with<br>the agent, the name of the game is really to increase close rate. And the way that we do that is giving agents better tools to serve our customers.<br>So if you notice that a customer is online on our website, but just hasn't been active with the brokerage, that's a signal that you probably need to<br>reach out and see what's going on. If you notice that the customer is searching often but hasn't set up online alerts, that's a sign that you need to<br>do that for the customer. So I think most of the software that we're developing over the course of this year is to personalize the service so that we<br>know more about what that customer needs at any given moment and can be there to deliver that service at the right time. And we think that it<br>can significantly increase close rate because we still spend most of our time with people who don't end up buying a house.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
We'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Mark Stephen F. Mahaney</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst<br>
I just had a question about what's implied in the March quarter guidance. Making a reasonable range of assumptions, it looks like you're predicting<br>that real estate revenue is going to grow high teens, maybe to low 20s, something like that, which is a pretty sharp deceleration from the growth<br>over the last 4 quarters. Is that really all due to macro conditions? We've seen the January housing supply indicators get tougher. Is that -- and -- is<br>that what's really driving it? So just spell that out a little bit more. It seems like a pretty drastic deceleration in the growth rate.<br>
<b>Chris Nielsen</b> - Redfin Corporation - CFO and Principal Financial &amp; Accounting Officer<br>
Sure, Mark. This is Chris. So we've obviously reflected the best information we have right now into our Q1 guidance. It is fair to say that the year<br>started more -- with a more challenging macro environment than we'd otherwise might have expected. As you also noted NAR reported January<br>transaction volume was down 2% from January of last year and inventory levels are about 10% lower than last year. And so that's certainly what<br>

we've reflected in our guidance. As the quarter continues to progress, we have had some encouraging signs over the last couple of weeks, and<br>we've reflected that in our guidance as well.<br>
<b>Mark Stephen F. Mahaney</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst<br>
And the time it would take some of these productivity improvements to offset those more challenging macro conditions, you think those are -- is<br>that quarters? Is that years?<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
It will take at least 6 months. So we didn't initiate this program just to accelerate revenue in the first quarter. We did it to make our customers more<br>successful. We did it to make our business more efficient long term. And so we trained people in February. We'll continue to do so in March. And<br>that should have us well prepared for the heart of the homebuying season, which comes in the second and third quarters of the year. So we don't<br>expect to give you an update on whether the program is working until our second quarter earnings call.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our next question from Brent Thill with Jefferies.<br>
<b>Brent John Thill</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Glenn, just on, yes, some of the comments around the ad campaign. Certainly, many of us still live in the Bay Area have seen the billboards. Just<br>curious, from a quarter or 2 back, are you finding this to be a more expensive endeavor than maybe originally planned and you -- did you plan on<br>accelerating these investments on the advertising side or has this been kind of in the books? I know you mentioned this is the largest campaign<br>that you've run. I'm just curious if you could kind of walk through how you're thinking about the expense structure.<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
So the expenses don't really deviate from what we planned, at least for 2018, but we do see upside in future years to invest more aggressively in<br>advertising and drive faster growth than we'd expected. So we just wanted to put everyone on notice that if we see that opportunity to grow faster,<br>we'll take it. And the reason that we have increasing confidence in advertising is because we have started to see some durable awareness gains<br>from ads that we ran last year. We have a campaign that we really believe in. The simplicity of the 1% message lends itself well to billboards and<br>radio ads. And we think it's really going to result directly in more sales. So just having seen some encouraging results, we wanted to maintain our<br>discipline this year, but also let everyone know that there is the possibility that we will invest more aggressively in the future. So that is the most<br>likely outcome that we would see an opportunity in future years. It's also possible that we would say, &quot;Actually, this is going so well. We want to<br>invest more aggressively now.&quot; But that's not what we had in mind when we prepared the remarks. So our main thesis was that, in future years,<br>we could see a larger opportunity to advertise. So we just need to get some early returns and then make a judgment.<br>
<b>Brent John Thill</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Okay. And just to clarify the deceleration in the guidance. I just want to be clear. That is largely related to more the challenging macro conditions<br>versus any internal execution on the internal team?<br>

<A name=422></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, RDFN.OQ - Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, we ask ourselves every time there's a slowdown or a pickup, &quot;Is it us? Or is it the market?&quot; And sometimes it's us. And sometimes it's the market.<br>But in this case, we believe that the market has become more challenging, that U.S. sales volume was low in January, as Chris had noted, that<br>inventory is low. And so we're trying to take measures to grow despite that, and that's why we focus so much on share. When you will see us really<br>become troubled is if we start seeing market share gains significantly decelerate. It's always going to be somewhat sawtooth, but over quarters,<br>halves, years, we expect market share to grow fairly steadily. And so that's why we focus on that and not the ups and downs for the market. Chris,<br>do you want to add anything to that?<br>
<b>Chris Nielsen</b> - Redfin Corporation - CFO and Principal Financial &amp; Accounting Officer<br>
No. I think, Glenn, you said it very well.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
We'll now take our next question from John Campbell with Stephens.<br>
<b>John Robert Campbell</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - VP and Research Analyst<br>
Just wanted to take a quick second on the sell-side listing fee. Glenn, it sounds like you guys aren't planning on doing the 1% across the board<br>anytime soon. But just 2 questions. Do you ever envision a day where that 1% would be across the board in the U.S.? And then I guess, secondly,<br>as the industry starts to mimic your pricing, do you ever envision maybe even going below that 1% percent mark?<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Interesting question. So first of all, we are always focused on lowering our cost of goods sold so that we can expand our addressable market, sell<br>homes that are very inexpensive and still make a profit or pass the savings on to our customer by offering 1% to more markets. But I don't think<br>we'll do that in the next 6 months or 12 months. That's a long-term grind to make that pricing work in places where homes sell for $150,000 a year.<br>We do think that more competitors are going to try to match that price. That is obviously ground on which we like to fight because we've been so<br>focused on efficiency for so long. So if the market begins to agree that consumers really care about price, I think that's a world where Redfin can<br>really prosper more than any other brokerage. To go below 1% is possible. I think you have to start thinking about other ways to sell houses that<br>aren't so labor-intensive. A long time ago, for example, we asked customers to host their own open houses. And back in that day, they did not like<br>it. They want us to be there, putting the directionals out on the corner and bringing in flowers and everything else. So I think it's possible that there<br>is a new type of customer out there who wants a new product, but I would think about pricing that's significantly below 1% as inviting a new listing<br>product. It would be a counterpart on the other end to the concierge product that we developed, which really is serving a customer who wants<br>just a new level of convenience. And we thought we could take the economic advantage we've developed to actually let us invest more in the<br>house, more in the service than other brokerage traditionally have. So we would just take that and look at it a different way if we were to try to go<br>significantly below 1%.<br>
<b>John Robert Campbell</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - VP and Research Analyst<br>
Okay. That's helpful. So it just sounds like maybe less touch, less service, less field cost could allow you to do a little bit less than 1%?<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I wouldn't do something like that for a little bit less than 1%. We would do that probably if we wanted to offer a new product at a new price. But<br>it's really speculative right now. It's not as if we have some diabolical plan to do that next week that we just haven't told you about. We just rolled<br>

out 1% to almost all of our customers, and it's having a very sharp effect in 2017 and even in 2018. So I think we need to let that play through before<br>we say, &quot;Here's what we're going to do next.&quot;<br>
<b>John Robert Campbell</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - VP and Research Analyst<br>
Okay. That's helpful. And then one more if I could squeeze in. On the productivity, I guess, the transaction per lead agent, it just sound like a lot of<br>that is kind of end market-driven. You guys back to back quarters of declines. You had a long stretch of kind of gains there, but if we just excluded<br>the market impact, what do you think the -- like peak production per agent can possibly be on total transactions per year?<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, in what market? In this idealized market, it's a perfectly balanced market with 6 months of supply, I think it's sort of hard to hypothesize on<br>what agent productivity could be in a market that isn't today's market. We certainly think that agent productivity can increase. That's why we come<br>to work every day, is to make real estate better and more efficient and to make an agent's job easier so that we can give customers better value.<br>But we're not sharing our forward-looking projections on where we want to take agent productivity.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our next question from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.<br>
<b>Heath P. Terry</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Glenn, curious, we saw a little bit of an increase in revenue per transaction or revenue per home sold in the brokerage part of the business, which<br>is pretty counter to the trend that we had seen over time. How much of that -- what should we think about as being sort of the underlying drivers<br>from that -- for that? Is it an increase in the value of the homes being sold? Is it a function of moving up market in certain areas? And then as we<br>think about the efforts around driving more traffic to the site and sort of brand-building, should we expect that that's largely going to take the<br>form of television advertising? Or do you see opportunities in online beyond the performance-based advertising that you've been doing thus far?<br>.<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, let me take the first question first. I may ask Chris to weigh in with some additional detail. But the pricing or the revenue per transaction is<br>really a function of mix shift. So we save customers a lot of money when they sell a house through us. We save them a still significant, but less<br>money, when they buy a house through us. And so we're always calibrating our pricing, especially the refunds that we give to buyers, there's a<br>commission that's paid to us as the buyer's agent, and then we give a portion of that to the buyer. And we change that amount as the mix shifts<br>towards listings. So we're trying to keep revenue per transaction steady quarter through quarter through quarter. And if the listing business grows<br>a little faster than we expected, then we have to lower the commission refund a little faster than we expected. And so what you saw happen now<br>is just pricing ahead of that. So we know that listings are going to continue to grow very quickly, and we wanted to price ahead of that. And I would<br>expect that, that will neutralize as listing share catches up to that so that revenue per transaction basically remains constant. And what that means<br>is that much of our gross margin upside comes from lowering cost per transaction, not trying to increase prices on the consumer. I think it's possible<br>that we can move up market. Generally, as we do that, we also move down market. We're fairly acquisitive about share. And so if we sell more<br>expensive houses, it gives us a little bit of latitude to also take on customers who are buying more affordable houses, too. Chris, do you want to<br>add anything to that?<br>

<A name=424></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, RDFN.OQ - Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Chris Nielsen</b> - Redfin Corporation - CFO and Principal Financial &amp; Accounting Officer<br>
Just one more comment echoing what you said, which is there is some movement quarter to quarter with regard to revenue per brokerage<br>transaction, and it has to do mostly with mix. Over longer periods of time, you can see that balance out a little bit. So for all of last year, revenue<br>per brokerage transaction was actually quite consistent with that from 2016 at just over 30 -- or $9,400.<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
And then to come to your second question, Heath, just about the shift from traditional media to digital. Everyone sees that coming. More people<br>are spending more time online. It's just that the major Internet platforms are pricing that into their ads. So we will probably see some of our media<br>move online, but we're still definitely interested in learning about all the ways we can reach people through traditional media. So we've just begun<br>with radio and outdoor. And the reason we did that is we just thought we had such a good message for, say, a billboard. Everyone should just know<br>in a town that you can sell a house for 1% instead of a 2.5% or 3%. And a billboard is the perfect way to get that out. So we wanted to try it.<br>
<b>Heath P. Terry</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Great. That's really helpful. And to the extent the best way to think about your performances is the share gains that you're seeing, any change in<br>your view or your perception of sort of where those share gains are coming from? Who was losing that share to you?<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I don't think there's really been any change. There's certainly some new competitors, but we haven't really seen a change in the dynamics around<br>market share.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) We'll now take our next question from Jason Deleeuw with Piper Jaffray.<br>
<b>Jason Scott Deleeuw</b> - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - VP &amp; Senior Research Analyst<br>
Yes. So I just want to make sure I understand how the seller mix, which sounds like it's still growing as an overall mix versus the buyer mix, how the<br>seller mix actually impacts the gross margins of the business. Could you have higher agent productivity because you're more or less guaranteed<br>a sale representing the seller and you don't have as much of an impact from the homebuyer taking longer to find a house or close on a house? So<br>I'm just trying to understand the dynamics of the growing seller mix and how that impacts the gross margin.<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, we make more money from buyers even though it's harder to buy a house than it is to sell one. And that's just because our fees are higher<br>when we represent a buyer than when we represent a seller. We keep more of the commission in that situation. So what you're seeing as we have<br>more and more listings as a percentage of our overall sales is that we have to keep more of the commission that is given to us, rather than refunding<br>such a large portion to the buyer. And that's how we keep revenue per transaction between buyers and sellers basically flat year-to-year. And what<br>happened last year is we got a little bit behind that because listings grew a little faster than we expected. And now what we're doing is trying to<br>price just a little bit ahead of that, but the goal is to keep revenue per transaction flat. And trying to answer your question, just remember, we make<br>more money from buyers than sellers. So as the mix shifts toward sellers, we have to charge buyers just a little bit more to pay for that.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
We'll now take our next question from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair.<br>
<b>Stephen Hardy Sheldon</b> - William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Analyst<br>
Just want to get an update on trends over the last few quarters in the markets where you have 1% commission rate. I get the environment is a little<br>more challenged lately, but have you seen any notable increase in market share over the last few quarters in those markets? Or is it still too early,<br>I guess, to see that impact?<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I would say that it's early in those markets to declare victory, but it was a well-established finding before we launched in those markets that the<br>overall impact on share among buyers and sellers accelerates modestly when we shift pricing toward the seller to benefit the seller. And that's, as<br>we said, because the seller is so much more price-sensitive. She signs a contract before listing her house. She agrees to a price before listing her<br>house when she chooses an agent. And so in Denver and San Diego and Seattle and places like that, we had run 1% pricing for years. And we<br>carefully studied whether that hurt our share among buyers, whether it helped our share among sellers. And what we determined was that, overall,<br>it had a positive effect. And it's possible, of course, that as the market shifts, which inevitably it will, toward buyers, that we want to recalibrate that<br>pricing to benefit the buyer more. But right now, everybody in real estate wants to represent sellers, and our pricing really favors that.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
We'll now take our next question from Tom Champion with Cowen.<br>
<b>Thomas Steven Champion</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - VP<br>
Apologies if I missed it, but can you talk about your thoughts around gross margin expectations for full year '18? I think there was some commentary<br>about it on the last call. And then just a quick one. Can you let us know your total markets? I think it's mid to high 80s. But just curious where you<br>are now and maybe how that should trend going forward.<br>
<b>Chris Nielsen</b> - Redfin Corporation - CFO and Principal Financial &amp; Accounting Officer<br>
Sure. So this is Chris. We haven't set any specific expectations for gross margin in 2018. The commentary on the last call and a little bit on this call<br>is a point that we're making -- that we are hiring more agents to help even more customers more deeply on the buy side, help them sort through<br>low inventory situations, low inventory conditions, to find the right home for them. And so -- on a relative basis, that means that gross margin will<br>hold down because we'll spend some more on agent compensation to help out customers more than we otherwise would. So just directionally,<br>that's the feedback that we provided. In terms of markets, we are in 86 markets across the U.S. at this point.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
We'll now take our next question from John Egbert with Stifel.<br>
<b>John Peter Egbert</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Associate<br>
I was wondering how longtime Redfin agents are responding to plans to lower the number of customers they'll be working with. Are they worried<br>this could hurt their individual earnings potential? Or do they buy in to the rationale that this could benefit closing rates across the company? And<br>

also, how do you think traditional brokerages are trying to navigate these same headwinds of the housing inventory crunch? Are they employing<br>different strategies or trying some of the same things?<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
So the strategy to reduce the number of customers each agent supports was met with widespread enthusiasm at our annual kickoff, which we<br>held on January 12, even among the most well-tenured agents. And I think it would be different if we were taking them to a level of customers<br>that was radically lower than what they'd experienced in the past. This is higher than what they had in 2016, just lower than 2017. And I think<br>everyone just felt that this is exactly the service we want to provide and that we'll actually do better by our customers given the difficulty of the<br>housing environment. So I would say that I've rolled out, Chris has rolled out, Scott, our president of real estate operations, has rolled out all sorts<br>of initiatives that have been met with mixed responses at kickoffs. This was one that was universally or near universally embraced. People love it.<br>Was there a second part to that question? Or was that it?<br>
<b>John Peter Egbert</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Associate<br>
There was a -- how you think traditional brokerages that you compete with are trying to navigate those same headwinds? Are they employing<br>similar strategies or different strategies?<br>
<b>Glenn Kelman</b> - Redfin Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
You'd have to ask them. I'm not trying to be flip or coy. I just -- I know that when people try to speculate on what Redfin was thinking, I wonder<br>why don't they just ask us? And in this case I think the most respectful thing to do would be to ask them.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) We'll now take our next question from Brad Erickson with KeyBanc.<br>
<b>Elliot Jacob Arnson</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - Associate<br>
This is Elliot Arnson on for Brad. Just real quick going back to the deceleration implied for Q1, can you just comment a little bit about the pace of<br>agent hiring or lead volume growth?<br>
<b>Chris Nielsen</b> - Redfin Corporation - CFO and Principal Financial &amp; Accounting Officer<br>
Sure. So we're not giving specific guidance for Q1 agent hiring, but you can see that both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we did continue<br>to step up our hiring of lead agents. And that's in anticipation of being able to help even more customers more deeply through the first part of this<br>year and really have those customers in a good position then to get them all the way through the close of transactions in the second and third<br>quarters. So we're not providing any more detailed guidance on our expectations there.<br>

<b>iv. </b>Had statements from many Xceligent employees that theft was a widespread practice in Xceligent, supported by senior<br>
executives directing their employees and contractors to steal CSGP data and photos and use them to build and sell<br>Xceligent's products illegally.<br>
<b>v. </b>Believes over the course of two decades, Xceligent never made a profit or even approach breakeven.<br>
<b>vi. </b>Believes by 2017-end, they were spending roughly $5m a month, losing about $5m a month, against approx. $2m or<br>
so of monthly revenue; $2 of loss for $1 of revenue roughly.<br>
<b>vii. </b>Immediately after Xceligent's bankruptcy, recently fired CEO of Xceligent launched a brand new co. called Intrepid that<br>
claimed to have roughly the same data coverage and software that Xceligent had the prior weeks when it closed.<br>
<b>viii. </b>Bankruptcy trustee appointed in Xceligent chapter 7 filing shut the startup down relatively quickly.<br><b>f. </b>With Xceligent's failure somewhere around 5,000 companies suddenly found themselves without a commercial state<br>
information system.<br>
<b>i. </b>This left Co. with an unprecedented opportunity to act quickly to pick up tens of millions of dollars of orphaned business.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Co. pulled out all the stops to respond at the maximum level of effort.<br>
<b>g. </b>On short notice in Jan., Co. then launched 30 city road show to market where Xceligent had a presence.<br>
<b>i. </b>With all of senior executives, Co. personally visited 1500 of Xceligent's former clients to let them know all about the<br>
valuable CoStar service it had to offer them.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Went to markets big and small of important from Houston, Atlanta, Miami, Minneapolis, Little Rock, Northwest Arkansas,<br>
Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Columbus.<br>
<b>iii. </b>Objective was to meet as many former Xceligent users as possible, to educate them on the depth and breadth of Co.'s<br>
service offering.<br>
<b>iv. </b>Co.'s service costs more than Xceligent's did and it's well worth it and it's sustainable.<br>
<b>v. </b>All told, about 1,000 CSGP staff were involved in these meetings in person or via videoconference, with hundreds of<br>
flights, believes Jan. 2018 was likely Co.'s highest travel expense month ever.<br>
<b>vi. </b>In order to 1,500 companies into rooms on one week notice, gave away Apple iWatches to highlight Co.'s cool upcoming<br>
CoStar for Apple iWatch product.<br>
<b>vii. </b>Potential net present value of signing up each one of these clients typically can be $50,000 and much, much larger, so<br>
giving them an Apple iWatch to get them into the door for sales pitch, where one has about 30% to potentially 60%<br>close rate is no-brainer.<br>
<b>viii. </b>The effort has already resulted in Co.'s signing over up to about 1,000 former Xceligent clients, 1000 former Xceligent<br>
client firms.<br>
<b>ix. </b>In addition, this already had a dramatic effect on further improving Co.'s data as these new clients are regularly<br>
contributing updates and sharing information with research team, much more proactively than they have been.<br>
<b>x. </b>Believes this Xceligent development represents a $50m plus annual revenue opportunity for Co.<br>
<b>xi. </b>Many of former Xceligent customers that have yet to sign for CSGP were relying on LoopNet or LoopNet Premium<br>
Searcher as a low-cost alternative to CoStar.<br>
<b>9. </b>LoopNet was another driver behind 4Q sales achievement and successful integration of CSGP and LoopNet databases made<br>
that possible.<br>
<b>a. </b>Prior to 4Q17 loopnet.com and costar.com were each supported by their own separate databases.<br><b>b. </b>They were linked and information flowed back and forth between these databases somewhat imperfectly, but by definition,<br>
it could be improved.<br>
<b>c. </b>The separate databases drove higher costs for both CSGP and clients, while degrading data quality.<br>
<b>d. </b>CSGP services are highest-quality professional information tool used by more than 100,000 industry professionals.<br>
<b>e. </b>LoopNet is a marketing platform, with unmatched audience of approx. 5m monthly end users shopping for commercial<br>
real estate each month or a month.<br>
<b>f. </b>Both services are well regarded for their respective brand strengths, there is brand confusion however, significant brand<br>
confusion because LoopNet also has three legacy information products that were frankly inadequate for professionals.<br>
<b>g. </b>They were Premium Searcher, property comps and property facts.<br>
<b>i. </b>Information they presented were notoriously incomplete and inaccurate.<br>

<A name=432></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, CSGP - Q4 2017 CoStar Group Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>ii. </b>Premium Searcher was largest LoopNet information product and allowed users that paid a monthly fee to see both<br>
advertise listings on LoopNet and ones that brokers had listed for free.<br>
<b>iii. </b>Premium Searcher can see 20-40% more listings on the LoopNet and then a free LoopNet user could see.<br>
<b>h. </b>With the pre-integrated LoopNet in CSGP, half the commercial real estate world updated LoopNet and the other half<br>
update CSGP making neither one the clear and simple go-to solution.<br>
<b>i. </b>That increased research costs under greater quality.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Several years ago, number of LoopNet unlimited listing plans were sold, which allowed brokerage firms to market huge<br>
numbers of listings on LoopNet.<br>
<b>iii. </b>First it was a few dollars a listing, which is just inadequate, these plans were misused and cannibalized both LoopNet<br>
and CSGP revenue.<br>
<b>iv. </b>As part of integration, Co. has been discontinuing these unlimited listing plans in addition to premium searcher itself.<br>
<b>v. </b>There's a little bit of headwind created to Co.'s sales as it winds down those unlimited plans.<br>
<b>i. </b>Notified the client base in early fall 2017 of intentions to discontinue these products.<br>
<b>i. </b>Almost immediately a large volume of LoopNet premium searchers began migrating to CSGP.<br>
<b>ii. </b>As these users begin voluntarily migrating from LoopNet to CSGP, Co. lost the revenue they were paying LoopNet for<br>
information, but typically gained four times that revenue for CSGP subscription.<br>
<b>iii. </b>Just a few weeks ago, notified premium searchers that their service will be can discontinued this month.<br>
<b>iv. </b>There are a small number that will be discontinued throughout year, but overwhelming majority are discontinued as<br>
of this month.<br>
<b>v. </b>As Co. discontinues Premium Searcher in Feb. 2018, expects to lose approx. $1.8m in monthly revenue immediately,<br>
but expect to more than make up the lost revenue within the year as it converts many of these clients to much more<br>powerful and profitable CSGP Information Solutions.<br>
<b>vi. </b>Expects to see a sales headwind in Feb. 2018, but with offsetting gains through both 2018 and 2019.<br>
<b>vii. </b>This clearly suppresses margin expansion in first two quarters of year, but drives really valuable, potential, intermediate<br>
and long-term EBITDA expansion.<br>
<b>viii. </b>There is never an easy time to intentionally eliminate $22m of annual revenue, but current timing seems the best.<br>
<b>ix. </b>With LoopNet Premium Searcher and Xceligent gone, believes there is more market clarity as clients migrate to CSGP.<br>
<b>10. </b>Through the end of Jan. 2018, converted over 5,400 LoopNet Premium Searchers or heavy searchers to annual CSGP<br>
subscription users at nearly $520 net new per month.<br>
<b>a. </b>Many of these LoopNet users upsold CSGP were paying $0 before, and those paying were paying about $145 per month<br>
on avg.<br>
<b>b. </b>Blended avg. LoopNet price was $49 prior.<br>
<b>c. </b>That successful conversion drove massive surge in CSGP sales in 4Q17.<br>
<b>d. </b>There are approx. 80,000 more discontinued LoopNet Premium Searches or heavy LoopNet searchers who now have<br>
dramatically less access to free content and Co. is focused on upsigning them to CSGP this year.<br>
<b>i. </b>It is Co.'s number one priority.<br>
<b>e. </b>In a market like Phoenix, in the past a broker may have had previously using LoopNet a broker may have had access to<br>
about 75% plus of available listings on Premium Searcher.<br>
<b>i. </b>Now that broker can only see 44% of those listings.<br>
<b>ii. </b>In addition, only CSGP for Phoenix provides details on tens of thousands of tenant sales comps, lease comps marketing<br>
analytics, industry news forecast and lot more.<br>
<b>iii. </b>Believes they will renew at high rate.<br>
<b>f. </b>Commissioned a third party research firm to conduct extensive market research and focus groups during this past Dec.,<br>
Jan., and Feb.<br>
<b>g. </b>One preliminary results one might find interesting is the response, more than a 1000 CRE professional surveyed had to<br>
the following question, a CRE information services you use, which one do you to turn to first.<br>
<b>i. </b>56% take CSGP, 31% said LoopNet, 3% said Catalyst, 1% said Real Capital Analytics, 1% Pure size, 1% AIR, less than 1%<br>
Reis, less than 1% CompStak, less than 1% Axiometrics, less than 1% Proptylink and 4% said other.<br>
<b>ii. </b>So that is 87% CSGP and 3% for next closest player.<br>

<b>9. </b>Rent growth has slowed over past year as strong growth of 2015 and 2016 have given way to more typical gains about 1.5%<br>
YoverY for office, 2% for multi-family, 2.5% for retail.<br>
<b>a. </b>Industry continues to post extraordinary growth in excess of 5%.<br><b>b. </b>RIETs have underperformed broad market over the past year, supply for industrial multifamily and office will put pressure<br>
on tight fundamentals.<br>
<b>10. </b>Home ownership rate has risen for four consecutive quarters, heralding the end of an unprecedented era moving one way<br>
towards apartment demand.<br>
<b>11. </b>Commercial real estate transaction volumes which reached all-time highs in 2016 was lower in 2017.<br>
<b>a. </b>Co.'s analysis of transaction data shows flattening prices.<br>
<b>12. </b>Cap rates appear to have risen marginally in response to interest rate increases.<br><b>13. </b>String of good economic news, three quarters of healthy GDP ratings and strong job numbers, and passage of Trump tax<br>
cuts, should provide some fresh tailwinds to real estate fundamentals.<br>
<b>a. </b>Encouraging economic data has also put fed on notice and FOMC raised the policy rate three times last year with future<br>
hikes expected this year.<br>
<b>14. </b>Prospect of higher interest rates could erode an essential value proposition of commercial real estate this cycle, which was<br>
widespread to risk-free rates.<br>
<b>a. </b>For multi-family sector, high-interest rates may support more demand as would be homebuyers are priced at the mortgage<br>
markets and continue to rent.<br>
<b>15. </b>Commercial real estate market is viewed as an effective inflation hedge.<br>
<b>a. </b>Best of all for hospitality sector which reprices daily.<br>
<b>16. </b>When hot markets stabilize, some bad deals can get done, that's why Co. has been building out new analytic offerings and<br>
strong news organization to give customers, brokers, property managers and owners/developers the tools to navigate<br>these more volatile waters.<br>
<b>17. </b>Taken together, sees a healthy but maturing commercial real estate multifamily sector.<br>
<b>C. Summary:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Recent developments like investment to capture share following Xceligent's bankruptcy and opportunity to close highly<br>
potential accretive ForRent acquisition have created margin pressure for 1H18, but Co. believes it will dramatically expand<br>EBITDA generation in an immediate term and remain on track for 40% adjusted EBITDA margin goals in 2018.<br>
<b>II. 4Q17 FINANCIALS (S.W.)</b><br>
<b>A. Highlights:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Strong momentum exiting 2017 sets Co. up for a strong financial year in 2018 and beyond.<br><b>2. </b>Revenue growth:<br>
<b>a. </b>2017, 15% over 2016.<br><b>b. </b>4Q17 revenue grew 16% YoverY.<br>

<b>B. Revenue Performance By Services:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>CoStar Suite:<br>
<b>a. </b>Revenue growth increased to 15% vs. 4Q16.<br>
<b>i. </b>Above top-end of 13-14% guidance range.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Accelerated from strong 13% revenue growth rate in 1H17.<br>
<b>b. </b>Strong revenue growth is in large part due to investment in Richmond and research capabilities and in success in converting<br>
the LoopNet information users to CSGP.<br>
<b>i. </b>Expects CSGP revenue growth rates to improve further in 2018, as Co. accelerates LoopNet conversions and reaches<br>
more of former Xceligent customers that are in need of commercial real estate information.<br>

revenue growth rates over past two years.<br>
<b>2. </b>Information services:<br>
<b>a. </b>Revenue growth rate remained negative, as expected, as Co. continues to wind-down LoopNet information products.<br><b>b. </b>Decided to accelerate this conversion actively and effectively discontinuing vast majority of LoopNet information service<br>

<b>c. </b>Strong revenue growth continued in LoopNet tiered advertising products, growing over 60% in 2017 vs. 2016.<br>
<b>d. </b>LoopNet Premium Lister revenue growth moderated somewhat in 4Q17, due to temporary disruptions from CSGP-LoopNet<br>
integration and Co.'s decision to discontinue certain non-subscription advertising products.<br>
<b>e. </b>Expects organic revenue growth in commercial property and land in 12-14% range for 2018, with growth rate at lower-end<br>
of range in 1H, improving towards upper-end of range by year-end as planned improvements are implemented and sales<br>force efforts accelerated.<br>

<b>a. </b>Broadly in line with 3Q17.<br><b>b. </b>Down 200 BP YoverY, reflecting increased investments in research.<br>
<b>c. </b>Vast majority of cost of revenues related to research operations, which are now broader and more effective than any time<br>

experienced.<br>
<b>2. </b>OpEx $145m.<br>
<b>a. </b>Unfavorable to forecast, primarily due to higher commission expenses related to outstanding 4Q sales performance.<br><b>b. </b>In addition to higher commission costs, increased marketing and other sales related costs late in 4Q following Xceligent<br>
bankruptcy in order to reach customers that were suddenly without information solutions.<br>
<b>i. </b>Although unplanned, expects these investments in 4Q and early in 1Q18 to generate significant returns in revenue<br>
growth this year and beyond.<br>

$13m for the year; in line with expectations.<br>

<b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs.<br>
<b>Keen Fai Tong</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
I'd like to dig into your margin outlook. You're continuing to target 40% EBITDA margins exiting 2018, but you're elevating your<br>investment spending in the first several quarters of the year. Out of the categories of investment spending that you've outlined, how<br>much of that investment do you expect to be temporary in nature, thus giving you confidence that you can actually hit your 40%<br>target?<br>
<b>Scott T. Wheeler</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - CFO &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
Yes. George, this is Scott. When you look at what we're investing in, I listed a number of things: expansion of our sales force;<br>improvements in research; to continue expanding a little bit internationally. All those things are intended to go after these revenue<br>growth targets that we have and also increase the revenue pace as we go forward. So what we'd rather do now as we go forward,<br>unlike 2017, where we made significant investments and didn't grow our margins, as we go forward, we want to keep pacing in<br>these smaller investments as we go and keep raising the margins, like we're doing now, the 350 basis points. So we balance the<br>investing we need to fuel growth in the future with the margin improvements that we need to make to both hit our commitments<br>and to give the returns that we committed to. So I don't think I would call any of them temporary. The litigation costs we had in<br>Xceligent, obviously, were temporary and we'll see those moderate as we go through the year. But the rest of these things are<br>worthwhile investments for the business.<br>
<b>Andrew C. Florance</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
But things like integration of ForRent are temporary or the roadshows are temporary or the unusually high commission costs are<br>temporary or the $0.5 million of chocolate baskets for Xceligent customers are temporary. iWatches are temporary. There's a lot of<br>temporary stuff in there that is spent in the first half.<br>
<b>Scott T. Wheeler</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - CFO &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
And definitely in the first part of the quarter, we had a good, at least, $5 million of those types of spendings.<br>
<b>Andrew C. Florance</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Man, were the kids impressed when I said I bought $0.5 million of chocolate over the weekend. I won't do that ever again.<br>

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Christiansen from Citigroup.<br>
<b>Peter Corwin Christiansen</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP and Analyst<br>
Super helpful commentary here. I know that you haven't given us margins by segment in the past. And I was just wondering if you<br>could just at least give us a sense of what the margin trajectory has been like, I guess, the last 12, 18 months in the multifamily side.<br>And as you scale that, cover your fixed cost, how has that progressed generally?<br>
<b>Andrew C. Florance</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
I'll take a rough shot there. We aren't describing -- we're not reporting it at that level. However, I can give you a feel for it. I did a<br>simple chart the other day of investments being big, red negative bar charts and then 4-wall profit being green. And basically, we<br>went through -- in '15 and '16, we -- '15, we went through a very significant year of investment as we ramped up the nationwide<br>brand advertising. Sales kicked up in '16. Those investments basically dropped. Net investment dropped in half, as revenues offset.<br>And we were -- I was very pleased in '17 to see clear-cut strong 4-wall profitability in Apartments.com. And then after we get through<br>all the noise and friction of closing a major acquisition, and even without it, then you move into even stronger margin growth. So I<br>think the margins we're seeing now, the contribution we're seeing from Apartments.com is very successful and, certainly, dramatically<br>more margin than we ever saw from the individual acquired company. So really good results, we think, people that we're very happy<br>with.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens, Inc.<br>
<b>Brett Richard Huff</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
In the -- I want you to reiterate what you said on something, the incremental amounts that you guys are making on the incremental<br>LoopNet user. I think you said the blended rate between the non-payers and the payers was something like $50 a user per month,<br>and you're making net $500. So just reiterate -- I want to make sure I got that right. And then how does that -- is that the data that<br>we've gotten so far on the 5,400? And do we expect that same kind of pricing lift to continue? Or will it taper? I mean, are we getting<br>the most juicy leads now and it should get less juicy over time in terms of pricing? Can you kind of go through that?<br>
<b>Andrew C. Florance</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Sure. Yes, so you're right. It's again just like the last time, we really pushed this a couple of years ago. The majority of the folks choosing<br>to subscribe go from heavy searching in LoopNet to subscribing to CoStar to get better information product. There are folks paying<br>absolutely nothing to LoopNet currently. So most of them are paying nothing. Those who are paying are paying $149. The blended<br>rate is $49. We're picking them up at about $520, $540 net, as they go into CoStar. So fantastic, 10x sort of uplift. To answer your<br>question, are we getting the low-hanging fruit first, absolutely not. I've sat there, I've been in 20 or 30 cities in the last month and<br>sat in a lot of focus groups watching people talk. And this, it's pretty straightforward to us. But as people sort out the differences<br>between the different products and LoopNet as a marketing platform, CoStar as an information platform, it takes a little bit of time.<br>Still, the #1 competition to CoStar is these folks using the -- being heavy searchers in LoopNet or formerly using Premium Searcher.<br>With the changes in the integrated back-end, when these people go into LoopNet product today, they're now seeing all the CoStar<br>icons showing listings that they can't see using their LoopNet account, and it's very compelling. And it will take a little bit of time.<br>The people aren't going to immediately commit to a 1-year, 2-year, 3-year CoStar contract. They've got to actually sort out. Sales<br>

people got to -- have to meet with them. Honestly, we have a bigger opportunity than we have number of salespeople. We mitigate<br>that. We're shifting our resource around. But it's something that takes time. And there isn't something -- there's still very significant<br>system flow of folks who, we think, will continuously come in and upgrade to CoStar. February will be -- we are eliminating some of<br>the standard pricing we had in December, January. We're being more rigorous in our pricing controls. But big picture, we anticipate<br>it will flow throughout the year and into '19, and it's a very compelling proposition -- value proposition to folks. But it just isn't<br>something where to turn a switch and people will jump over. It takes time.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America.<br>
<b>David Emerson Ridley-Lane</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
So LoopNet had roughly 1,700 paying customers. You had another 80,000 pretty intensive users. Given the conversions to date, you<br>converted just 5% of the base. I'm curious what drove the decision to accelerate the conversion, particularly because you had the<br>Xceligent bankruptcy, which is obviously a large opportunity that you need to capitalize on as well.<br>
<b>Andrew C. Florance</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Okay. So I think the number of subscribers is close to 32,000 because you have to look at folks who were getting Premium Lister with<br>a subscriber element or unlimited listers. So the numbers is not -- I think it's higher than 17,000. It's closer to 30 -- 32,000. And then<br>you had another 50,000, 60,000 that we classify as heavy searchers on LoopNet. The reason you would accelerate -- like, so you're --<br>originally, we had contemplated rolling out that Premium Searcher over a 12-, 18-month time frame just to continue the rolling time<br>period. When you look at the folks who are using Xceligent as an information system, a very, very large number were supplementing<br>the inadequacies of Xceligent's system by using LoopNet, so it's actually one and the same thing. And the changes that occurred at<br>Xceligent, you're working against yourself when you are providing a Premium Searcher product to someone that you're trying to<br>convert into CoStar. So you're probably -- you're providing a low-cost, low-value product to them to prevent them from making a<br>decision to go over to CoStar. And you plan to eliminate it anyhow and you communicate it to them prior to the Xceligent bankruptcy<br>that you're going to eliminate it anyhow. And also, I think we have to work to a slightly higher standard now on how we treat all our<br>customers given our increased competitive position. So we didn't want to be in any situation where we were picking and choosing<br>which markets or which people we eliminate Premium Searcher on and have any image that we were handpicking discontinued<br>Xceligent clients to discontinue their Premium Searcher. So we went ahead and just did across-the-board and including, in some<br>cases, making the right choice, the difficult choice to eliminate Premium Searcher with a person who was also subscribing to CoStar<br>currently, so it's just good customer service. But they're related. They're directly related. It's one and the same decision-making<br>process. And by doing this, we facilitate a faster, good result across the overall, though you take a -- it requires a little bit of extra<br>character in the first half of the year. By the way, I listened to -- we have a pretty sophisticated phone system, monitoring system. It<br>can listen to sales pitches and you just listen to -- I listen to 100 salespeople trying to sell various products to former Xceligent folks.<br>And you can see the person saying, &quot;Well, I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do,&quot; while you're watching them do 100 searches<br>that we can LoopNet Premium Search it, like we're just working against ourselves here. So that's really why they're related.<br>

<b>Sterling Auty</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst<br>
So I want to go deeper into the conversions and the price. So you're netting out, call it, $500 on these conversions. Given that huge<br>untapped base that you still have yet to convert, based on the focus groups that you've done, what do you think is realistic in terms<br>of how -- what percentage that you can bring over and at what price point? Because I think, at the beginning of the process, you've<br>talked about maybe doing a $200 level of functionality, maybe a $400 level of functionality and then we'll call it CoStar. Had that<br>kind of pricing approach or strategy morphed as you've done more work in the space?<br>
<b>Andrew C. Florance</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes, it changed a little bit. So it's a -- we initially were focusing on, as you said, the $200, $400. We're not getting a lot of pickup in<br>the $200. People are -- if they know what they're -- if they don't know what they're doing, some of them accidentally buy the $200.<br>But this is what they do for a living. This is their trade. This is their Bloomberg terminal. And the $400 solution is incredibly powerful<br>and gives them an amazing information solution with tons of revenue-generating opportunities. The $200 is adequate and meets<br>everything that LoopNet Premium Searcher was doing and a lot more. So I think it's probably 19 of the $400 to 1 of the $200. And<br>that's just what people are opting for. And I think it's actually shifting even further. So I think it will be like sub-5%, sub-3% of the<br>lower cost solution at the customers' behest. So -- and again, in the focus groups, it's just amazing how they're all just trying to figure<br>out what's going on. You've got Xceligent. You've got these board systems. You've got LoopNet Premium Searcher, Premium Lister.<br>You've got CoStar. And you would think it was pretty easy for them to sort it out. There's a lot of confusion out there. And what we're<br>doing is we're really simplifying that decision-making process for them. And it will take 1 year or so to sort of really simplify this and<br>get them migrated into the right products. But we're highly confident that a very substantial portion of these folks will ultimately<br>be using CoStar for information and LoopNet for marketing. One of the things I don't think we spent a lot of time on the call that<br>did come out loud and clear in these most recent rounds of focus groups is one of the beautiful things here is LoopNet remains<br>viewed by our customers as an essential utility to marketing their listing to end-users. CoStar is viewed as an essential utility for -- a<br>very valuable utility for information solutions. So as we're doing this, the marketing side of LoopNet, to me, has never looked stronger.<br>The information side in CoStar has never looked stronger. And there's a whole bunch of painful confusion in the middle there in<br>those information products, and that's going to take 1 year to sort out.<br>

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.<br>
<b>Oscar D. Turner</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - Associate<br>
This is Oscar Turner on for Andrew. I was wondering if you can provide more color into the line of sight to the 40% exit rate margin<br>target by year-end. And how should we think about the likelihood that sustained strong sales momentum leads to<br>higher-than-expected marketing expenses through the fourth quarter?<br>
<b>Scott T. Wheeler</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - CFO &amp; Principal Accounting Officer<br>
So when you look at the progression, we expect, as we commented on, that as our marketing ramps up into the second quarter,<br>margins seasonally go down and then they pick up into the third and then go up higher in the fourth. We've seen that same pattern<br>in the last couple of years and our spend is concentrated around the TV and the broadcast for the apartments marketing in the<br>summer months. So we really don't see that kind of pressure coming into the fourth quarter, unless something unusual happened.<br>Like this year, with the bankruptcy of Xceligent, we went around and spent quickly and mobilized, but at least...<br>

You next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.<br>
<b>William Arthur Warmington</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Equity Analyst<br>
So a serious question for you. So on the ForRent acquisition, you mentioned you're going to be bumping the size of the sales force<br>on the multifamily side by 50%, which is a real positive. But last time, with Apartment Finder when you had a big bump in the sales<br>force, we ended up with a number of issues. What gives you confidence that those issues are not going to repeat this time?<br>
<b>Andrew C. Florance</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Bill, what sort of -- just remind me again, when you talk about issues, what sort of things come to mind?<br>
<b>William Arthur Warmington</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Equity Analyst<br>
The -- when you started to put the sales forces together that there were a lot of salespeople on the Apartment Finder side that you<br>were changing around the commission structure, the sales territories, and a number of them left and had to be -- either voluntarily<br>or not, had to be replaced and that set us back...<br>
<b>Andrew C. Florance</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
That's a good question, Bill. So we -- we have grown the sales force over time at a prettier clip. We reorganize it from time to time,<br>as we have an unbelievable amount of opportunity to reach new customers on both the CoStar side and the Apartment side. In the<br>Apartment side, one of the big drivers there is that people with smaller and smaller communities are spending money advertising<br>on Apartments.com network. So we get to all of our customers or 95% of our customers every quarter for service, but we only get<br>to 10%, 15% of the prospects every quarter. And we want to get to all of them every quarter. And one of our goals is to try to get to<br>everyone with 50 units or up during the course of the quarter. Having a larger sales force helps us do that. The -- without a doubt,<br>

there are -- in any acquisition, there's always cultural issues. Someone has been in a pattern doing something within a company for<br>15 years and there's a big change like a merger with another company. People make decisions about what they want to do, and<br>that's healthy and that's good. Some significant number will find the opportunity with Apartments.com really exciting. They'll think<br>being on the clear-cut winning team is exciting. There'll be, without a doubt, more earnings potential for them with the Apartments.com<br>network. And some people may have been -- alternately, some folks will decide that the last 20 years at ForRent had been great and<br>they're going to do something else or hang it up now. They're both fine. And we do anticipate and have planned for some number<br>of people to decide to do something different. So that number will come down a little bit during the year. Eventually, we'll rebuild<br>it at a slow pace. But net-net, you're going to end up with a great infusion of talented people that decide to make this their long-term<br>hold -- home. And it won't be the whole number that you start with, but it will be a good number. And they'll also bring a lot of<br>knowledge and culture and that's valuable to us, the rev-up on everybody.

So we're -- this is a pretty big one<br>and we have to be reminded, right after closing ForRent, we were -- we're spending a lot of time and effort continuing to look at all<br>kinds of opportunities out there. There is a broad field. There's a lot going on. I do think we'll spend a little bit of time just focusing<br>on ForRent and making sure we do that right. You have to respect -- when you close one of the largest acquisitions by revenue and<br>headcount, you have to respect that and make sure you do it right and not get too confident. But no shortage of stuff and so part<br>of the bigger problem is selecting among an embarrassment of riches of opportunities to pursue. We are selective. We're selective<br>on valuation, so we won't rush. But again, if you were betting against CoStar continuing to do acquisitions, you wouldn't be a very<br>good better.<br>

Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon from William Blair.<br>
<b>Andrew C. Florance</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Stephen, we're really excited to have you on the phone.<br>
<b>Stephen Hardy Sheldon</b> - William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Analyst<br>
So yes, you talked about seeing research cost starting to trend down some this year. So a few questions on that. First, is that<br>commentary on an absolute basis or as a percentage of revenue? And second, as we look out over the next few years, how much<br>leverage would you expect to see in your research budget? I mean, do you need to add much more headcount to research at this<br>

point? Or just given the database integration and the improvements in data quality and automation from products, like Listing<br>Manager, could you keep your research headcount relatively steady over the next few years?<br>
<b>Andrew C. Florance</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
I think it's a thing that changes, and research is a -- as a percentage of revenue, it's a pretty modest investment. And it is a huge<br>competitive advantage in the market. It's the one thing that people continuously underestimate when they try to compete with us.<br>As Xceligent failed, they joined a long list of folks who have invested well over $1 billion in competition with us, and haven't gone<br>anywhere. The #1 reason is they just don't invest in doing the research. So it's been a long-term competitive advantage. But things<br>are changing pretty rapidly. We have so many people in our network now that a lot -- the things are changing. A lot of people have<br>a long-term relationship with us and want to enter the data electronically, and they do it well. We are conservative about it. We don't<br>release this new ability to edit your listings in CoStar and then, overnight, make dramatic changes to our research process. We are<br>studying it, discussing it. The focus groups were helpful in understanding that. And only when we know we're not going to harm<br>product quality, we make decisions to actually shift resources. There's continuously new demands for different kinds of research.<br>But my general sense is that, as the year moves on, we're going to find that some significant portion of our traditional workload<br>becomes automated. And that will allow us to keep the same headcount over time and not really grow headcount, so we can staff<br>new initiatives without adding people, but that is sort of in the gut feeling category done from an extremely conservative operational<br>point of view.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And at this time, there are no further questions.<br>
<b>Andrew C. Florance</b> - CoStar Group, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, thank you very much for joining us on the call. And we look forward to updating you on our progress towards our 40% adjusted<br>EBITDA margin goal in the Q4 of 2018, as we promised you in April of 2014.<br>

<A name=448></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, BMRN - Q4 2017 Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc Earnings Call<br>
With me today are Jean-Jacques Bienaim�, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Hank Fuchs, President Worldwide Research and Development;<br>Dan Spiegelman, Chief Financial Officer; Jeffrey Ajer, Chief Commercial Officer; and Robert Baffi, Head of Technical Operations.<br>
Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, J.J. Bienaim�.<br>
<b>Jean-Jacques Bienaim�</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Thank you, Traci. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. So 2017 was a momentous year for BioMarin driven by significant financial,<br>regulatory and clinical achievements. For the full year 2017, revenues topped $1.3 billion, which is an increase of 18% compared to 2016.<br>
We received U.S. and EU approvals for Brineura for the treatment of CLN2 in less than 4 years from the first patient being treated with our product.<br>As a result of that approval, we received a pediatric Priority Review Voucher, which we sold for more than half of Brineura's development cost.<br>Including safety and efficacy data from our Phase I/II study with gene therapy product, valoctocogene roxaparvovec or valrox, for the treatment<br>of severe Hemophilia A resulted in the launch of 2 separate Phase III studies, one of which started last December and the other one will start early<br>this year.<br>
Normally, I have authority supportive of the program. We received both prime and breakthrough designations. The patient community is very<br>enthusiastic about valrox, the notion of a potentially one-and-done treatment option for a patient community who dealt in the past with frequent<br>joint bleeds and the need to always have access to rescue medications even in the face of taking multiple weekly infusions of recombinant factor<br>VIII was inconceivable before gene therapy.<br>
Momentum is definitely building in this area of development in hemophilia, and we are thrilled to be at the forefront. Hank will provide additional<br>updates on valrox and our earlier stage programs shortly.<br>
Turning to our other late-stage development program, pegvaliase and visoritide, both of which progressed as expected over the year. At R&amp;D Day<br>last October, we shared data with visoritide in achondroplasia demonstrating consistent durability and safety over 30 months in our Phase I/II<br>subjects. The global Phase III program continues to enroll as planned, and we anticipate completion mid-year.<br>
The BLA for our next potential commercial product, pegvaliase, was filed last June and we look forward to the PDUFA outcome in late May. The<br>PKU market represents a significant opportunity as we have seen with Kuvan. And Jeff will walk us through his plans and our plans for the launch<br>and execution of commercial pegvaliase in the U.S. in a moment.<br>
Looking forward to 2018, double digit growth of revenue should continue, with total revenue expected to be between $1.47 billion to $1.53 billion,<br>representing growth of between 15% to 19% compared to 2017 results.<br>
In 2017, we reached non-GAAP income of $74 million for the year. And in 2018, we expect to improve upon those results to a range of $100 million<br>to $140 million in non-GAAP income, a 62% improvement from the midpoint.<br>
In the years to come, we intend to steadily increase bottom line results, while continuing to reinvest in our pipeline.<br>
In summary, 2017 was not only our 20th anniversary year, but also one of our most productive to date. As I have just reviewed our accomplishments<br>in 2017, I've laid the foundation for even greater productivity and execution in 2018 across the clinical regulatory and commercial pipelines.<br>
Now I will now turn the call over to Jeff who will review the Commercial business in more details. Jeff?<br>

<A name=449></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, BMRN - Q4 2017 Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
Thank you, J.J. We delivered record results of sales in 2017 and I'm very pleased with total BioMarin revenues for full year 2017 exceeding the<br>previous year by 18% and breaking the $1.3 billion mark for the first time.<br>
Starting with Vimizim. Patients on commercial therapy grew 20% in 2017, as well as a continued rise in identified patients increasing to over 2,000<br>worldwide. With only roughly half of the currently identified patients on commercial therapy and the fact that we continue to identify new patients,<br>there is opportunity for significant continued growth from here.<br>
Vimizim net product revenues were $114 million in the fourth quarter and $413 million for the full year, increases of 22% and 17%, respectively,<br>compared to the same periods in 2016.<br>
Last quarter, we had communicated risks associated with order patterns in Brazil. I'm glad to report that the fourth quarter reflected positive<br>ordering from Brazil, but we remain cautious on Brazil quarter-to-quarter in 2018 due to anticipated uneven buying patterns. Other areas of strength<br>in the fourth quarter included the EUMEA region, with Turkey in particular, Colombia in Latin America and North America.<br>
Looking towards full year 2018 Vimizim guidance, we expect continued revenue growth of between $460 million and $500 million in full year<br>revenues.<br>
Moving on to Naglazyme. Net product revenues were $94 million in the quarter and $332 million for the full year, increases of 25% and 12%,<br>respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. Significantly, the number of commercial patients increased by 6% in 2017, an indicator of the<br>continued growth and underlying demand for Naglazyme.<br>
Consistent with Vimizim results, Naglazyme sales benefited from an uptick in Brazilian orders in the fourth quarter. As a result, we remain cautiously<br>optimistic that sales in Brazil will be steady in 2018, but also anticipate uneven buying patterns quarter-to-quarter. Our Naglazyme guidance for<br>full year 2018 net product revenues is between $325 million and $355 million.<br>
Now onto Kuvan. 2017 represented the second full year of global sales of Kuvan by BioMarin since the acquisition of the PKU franchise at international<br>markets for Merck Serono and we are very pleased with the results. Kuvan net products revenue contributed over $107 million to the top line in<br>the fourth quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year. For the full year, Kuvan net product revenue was $408 million, a 17% increase over 2016.<br>
North American sales were paced by an increase of 7% in commercial patients year-over-year. The combination of strong results in North America,<br>combined with solid uptake internationally, gives us confidence in providing full year 2018 guidance of between $440 million and $480 million,<br>an increase of about 13% over 2017 results.<br>
Turning now to Brineura, which was approved in both the U.S. and EU in 2017. As we said when we got approval, the commercial strategy for<br>Brineura is different than for our typical ERT products. Our primary focus is on raising awareness among physicians to facilitate early diagnosis. The<br>goal is to have patients screened and diagnosed early, while they retain good function and are good candidates for treatment, and that will continue<br>to be our focus going forward.<br>
The initial Brineura launch is rolling out as anticipated. We are seeing a gradual steady ramp of new countries and additional sites for payer to<br>provide treatment and as a result, patients are being transitioned to receive commercial Brineura. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, we had<br>over 40 commercial patients worldwide, spanning 7 countries and 22 treatment sites.<br>
We continue to expect to have about 40 sites equipped to provide treatment with Brineura by mid this year. Our efforts to raise awareness of<br>Brineura and the importance of the early diagnosis is progressing nicely.<br>
The number of physicians experienced in Brineura is expanding and driving interest in the communities. We have learned a few things over the<br>first few quarters of launch, including that new site readiness can take longer than expected due to the complexity of multidisciplinary preparation<br>

within hospitals. However, we view this as part of the process given the uniqueness of Brineura and believe we are on track to manage any challenges<br>related to the complexity of planning port surgery and infusions.<br>
The early diagnosis programs we have put in place are gaining momentum. 100 institutions across the U.S. have participated to date in our Behind<br>the Seizure program, resulting in several children with CLN2 being diagnosed through that program. In Europe where we are navigating through<br>country-by-country reimbursement, we are on track and expect steady progress throughout 2018. We are very pleased with the pace of the launch<br>today and expect growing awareness of Brineura in the physician and CLN2 community. As a result, we expect solid revenue growth in 2018,<br>resulting in full year guidance of between $35 million and $55 million.<br>
Finally, now turning to pegvaliase for which we expect to learn U.S. approval status in late May. We are cautiously optimistic that a U.S. commercial<br>launch will be under way in the second half of this year.<br>
As we have communicated, upon the potential approval of pegvaliase, we will take a slow-and-go approach to the commercial launch. We have<br>learned over the course of developing pegvaliase that patients respond at varying rates, so we plan to take additional time upfront during the<br>induction and titration phase of treatment to get it right and keep patients on therapy up to and through the maintenance phase of treatment.<br>
The feedback we've gotten from the over 200 patients currently in our clinical studies is that working through the first phase of treatment is worth<br>the time and effort to get to maintenance therapy.<br>
We appreciate the many of you who are interested in knowing more about how we are thinking about pricing pegvaliase, so I would like to share<br>the following. The specifics of pricing will be available upon approval, but we do expect to price pegvaliase at a modest premium to the average<br>price from an adult Kuvan patient, currently about $150,000 annually, net.<br>
Further, during the initial induction titration phase of treatment, we would expect revenue to be fractional and then transition to full pricing once<br>maintenance dosing has been achieved. We're very excited about the opportunity with pegvaliase as it will be a significant component of our PKU<br>franchise.<br>
In the U.S., we expect pegvaliase will be the approved treatment of choice for adults, complementing Kuvan, which is and will continue to be<br>treatment of choice for children.<br>
Pegvaliase has proven to be highly efficacious in severe PKU adults resulting in significant reductions of phenylalanine. We believe the market is<br>excited about the approval of pegvaliase and that there's a lot of interest in gaining access once it is approved.<br>
We have years of experience working directly with the 35 clinical trial sites in the U.S. of the 125 total PKU clinics in the U.S. and, therefore, anticipate<br>hitting the ground running in product approval. As was the case with Brineura, we do not provide guidance -- revenue guidance in an approval<br>and launch year, so we look forward to keeping you apprised with our progress with pegvaliase following the outcome of our late May PDUFA.<br>
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to provide more detail on the fourth quarter and full year financial results. Dan?<br>
<b>Daniel K. Spiegelman</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Thanks, Jeff. Please see today's press release summarizing our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2017. Since Jeff already<br>reviewed 2017 revenue results and provided detailed 2018 revenue guidance, I will cover other 2017 result items and then provide our 2018 and<br>longer term financial guidance.<br>
Two key Q4 items to point out: first is the sale of the Priority Review Voucher for $125 million. The proceeds are classified as a gain on sale of an<br>intangible asset in operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Associated with the sale, there is also a provision for tax<br>expense of approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter results were also impacted by charges associated with the Tax Reform<br>

Act. First is a $42 million charge directly related to revaluation of our deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the federal rate from 35% to 21%<br>and due to additional limitations on tax deductible compensation.<br>
In addition, the company established a $41 million valuation allowance related to State of California tax credits. Based on increased incentives in<br>the Tax Reform Act to conduct R&amp;D in the United States, we now project that for the foreseeable future, we will generate more State of California<br>tax credits than we will utilize on an annual basis and, hence, the need for a valuation allowance and expense in this quarter against our existing<br>California credits.<br>
From the bottom line standpoint, results for the full year of 2017, GAAP net loss for the year was $117 million and non-GAAP income for the full<br>year was $74 million.<br>
We ended the year with $1.78 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Major inflows for the year included $482 million from the issuance<br>of convertible notes and $125 million from the sale of the PRV.<br>
Major uses of cash included gross capital expenditures for the year of just under $200 million, driven by the construction of our new gene therapy<br>manufacturing facility, finished build-out of our manufacturing facility in Shanbally to support commercial supply of Vimizim, plus some office<br>facilities in Novato and San Rafael. In addition, investment in inventory increased by $125 million due to the new approval of Brineura and increased<br>Vimizim and Kuvan revenues.<br>
Before reviewing 2018 guidance, let me remind you of the long-term guidance and financial plan that we laid out at the end of 2016. Specifically,<br>we have previously said and reiterate today that starting in 2017 and through the end of the decade, we expect revenues from our approved<br>products plus pegvaliase to grow 15% per year and then for revenue growth to accelerate above that level with visoritide and valrox.<br>
With respect to operating expenses, we have guided that they will generally grow on an absolute dollar basis, but at a lower rate than revenue<br>growth, creating incremental operating margin and bottom line expansion through the end of the decade and then acceleration of profit growth<br>after that.<br>
In addition to reiterating our long-term guidance, our 2018 guidance today is consistent with that plan. So turning now to 2018.<br>
2018 total revenue guidance is between $1.47 billion and $1.53 billion. To help analyze this compared to 2017 total revenues, excluding the one-time<br>Sarepta upfront payment, our 2018 revenue guidance represents revenue growth of between 15% and 19%. I would note that this 2018 revenue<br>forecast assumes that key currencies remain at the current exchange rates through the year. In addition, our revenue guidance does assume the<br>launch of pegvaliase in the United States in the second half of 2018, but we believe we can achieve revenues in this guidance range even without<br>pegvaliase.<br>
From a bottom line perspective, our GAAP net loss guidance for 2018 is $115 million to $165 million, and our benchmark of non-GAAP income<br>guidance is $100 million to $140 million, and an improvement at the midpoint over 2017 non-GAAP results of 62%.<br>
Our R&amp;D spend guidance for 2018 is between $645 million and $685 million is driven by both visoritide and valrox Phase III being in full swing in<br>2018 compared to a relatively light clinical spend year in 2017.<br>
SG&amp;A guidance for 2018 of between $575 million and $615 million is driven by the planned launch of pegvaliase, the continued launch of Brineura<br>and continued efforts on the growth of Vimizim and Kuvan.<br>
With our global infrastructure in place, straight G&amp;A spending is basically unchanged year-over-year.<br>
In total, 2018 SG&amp;A and R&amp;D expense guidance shows an increase of between 5% and 11.5% compared to 2018 revenue growth of between 15%<br>and 19%. The one area of margin contraction in 2018 is cost of sales with guidance of between 20% to 21% of revenues, about 200 basis points<br>

higher than last year's result. The main drivers of the 2018 cost of sales rate increase are related to additional production capacity from the Shanbally<br>facility coming online.<br>
More specifically, the Shanbally, Ireland facility approval results in some nonrecurring charges being recognized in 2018. But more importantly,<br>increased per unit production costs at current volumes. As revenues increase and new products get approved, we will more fully utilize that capacity.<br>And as that capacity gets utilized, we expect the cost of sales line to return to historical levels.<br>
Looking further out, both visoritide and valrox could have substantially improved gross margins, which could drive down our long-term cost of<br>sales level below our historic levels.<br>
In terms of capital spending, we expect overall capital investment in 2018 to be similar to 2017 and between $160 million and $180 million, primarily<br>in manufacturing and laboratory facilities. In addition, there will be an approximately $70 million to $90 million investment in additional inventory<br>to support new product launches and revenue growth.<br>
Finally, please recall that per our prior guidance, we intend to repay the $375 million principal amount of our maturing 2018 bonds in cash, regardless<br>of whether they mature in the money or not.<br>
Even with these capital and cash outlays, we continue to believe that our existing financial resources mean we won't need to do additional equity<br>or equity-linked financings except in the 3 circumstances we've previously mentioned: potential M&amp;A; refinancing our 2020 or '24 converts; or a<br>major product setback.<br>
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Hank to provide an update on our development programs. Hank?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Thank you, Dan. On the occasion of our year-end results call, I take a moment to reflect on what has been achieved over the last 12 months. I'm<br>proud of the innovativeness and productivity at BioMarin and it's all about alleviating suffering and helping others to live their life to their full<br>potential. So before I walk through the numerous accomplishments of the past year, I'd like to think the entire R&amp;D team and the rest of my<br>colleagues at BioMarin for their continued execution of our mission to get new treatments approved for the people who have come to rely on our<br>good work.<br>
Starting with valrox. It is remarkable to reflect on where the program was only a year ago. You may recall, when we started our program, we were<br>hoping to convert patients from severe to mild hemophilia. Last year, we were talking to you about the proof of concept results observed in 2016<br>in which we were going well beyond achieving a milder state of hemophilia. We augmented our plans with the addition of the 4E13 vector genomes<br>per kilo dose, and here we are today having demonstrated positive efficacy and safety data in our Phase I/II program that led to the launch of Phase<br>III GENEr8-1 and GENEr8--2 studies, both of which are open for enrollment. Importantly, with the start of these pivotal studies, we're seeing an<br>increase in the level of enthusiasm for valrox from the patient and physician communities.<br>
At our most recent data update at ASH last December, we were very excited to update results after treatment of patients with the 6E13 vector per<br>kilo -- vector genomes per kilo dose. Most patients have achieved and maintained Factor VIII levels within the normal range in severe hemophilia<br>A. Further, median annualized bleeding rates and vector use continue to be 0 for both metrics at that time point. We also shared up to 1 year results<br>with the 4E13 vector genomes per kilogram dose for 3 patients with the longest follow-up with Factor VIII levels in or near the normal range. As<br>the -- as a whole, the 4E13 vector genomes per kilo dose results at that time point, demonstrated sustained Factor VIII levels approaching or within<br>the lower end of the normal range for most patients. The 4E13 vector genome per kilo dose subjects also had median annualized bleeding rates<br>and factor use of 0 as of that time point.<br>
Concurrent with ASH, The New England Journal of Medicine published preliminary results of the ongoing Phase I/II study of valrox. The accompanying<br>editorial titled, &quot;A Cure for Hemophilia within Reach,&quot; highlighted the tremendous need for better therapy for patients because of the residual risk<br>of bleeding, the high cost of prophylactic therapy and the demanding nature of intermittent factor replacement. The editorial also established an<br>

important road map to enable access to an ever-larger circle of hemophilia patients, possibly including treatment at earlier ages, patients with<br>previous liver disease or immunity to the transferring capsid and even in potentially patients with inhibitors.<br>
As a leader in this field, we're committed to enabling valrox to do as much as possible for patients. Of immediate consequence, the next steps for<br>the program are to continue enrollment of the Phase III studies and provide an update on the Phase I/II study around midyear, so stay tuned.<br>
Enthusiasm for participation by sites and patients is very high. We don't think patient interest will in any way limit enrollment in the 2 studies. The<br>6E13 dose by year end and the 4E13 dose shortly thereafter.<br>
Turning to our gene therapy facility. It's completely built-out and we expect to have commercial scale material ready for use in the pivotal study<br>at the end of April. It has the capacity to supply between 2,000 and 3,000 6E13 vector genomes per kilo patients annually. We believe this capability<br>further increases BioMarin's lead in the field compared to any other company developing a gene therapy product for severe hemophilia A.<br>
Moving on to visoritide for children with achondroplasia. At R&amp;D Day last October, we showed durable growth velocity, sustained throughout [20]<br>(inaudible) 30 months of treatment using the 15-microgram per kilo dose. In addition, we shared data supporting expectations for continued<br>growth based on lead indicators and for potential improvement in other complications from the condition, such as spinal cord compression, [rim<br>and magnum] compressions, sleep apnea, disproportionality and daily activities that many of us take for granted.<br>
Specifically, over the 30-month observation periods, patients experienced mean absolute growth increase of approximately 4 centimeters over<br>what their baseline growth velocity would have predicted. In addition, treatment with visoritide demonstrated continued improvement over time<br>in proportionality as measured by a ratio of upper and lower body measurements, or the U/L ratio, as part of the 30-month update.<br>
Our feeder study, which establishes baseline growth rate prior to treatment, is now fully enrolled, reflecting the high degree of interest in the<br>patient community internationally and in the U.S. in particular. The treatment study continues to enroll with anticipated completion in mid-2018<br>and top line data in the second half of 2019.<br>
As we also announced in the first half of this year, we anticipate enrollment to commence in our infant-toddler study, supporting our belief that<br>in this indication in particular, the earlier treatment begins, the more benefit patients are expected to derive.<br>
We also let you know in January that we expected the FDA to hold a meeting to discuss achondroplasia given the unmet need for those who are<br>interested in treatment and the fact that no approved therapy exists in this pediatric indication. The meeting has been noticed in the Federal<br>Register and is planned for March 22 of this year where those of us in the development community as well as patients, key opinion leaders and<br>advocates, will have the opportunity to collaborate on establishing standards for drug development in achondroplasia. We look forward to<br>participating in this meeting with the goal of establishing high standards for clinical study design and endpoints just to name a couple of key<br>matters.<br>
Turning now to our most recently updated data for our newest program, BMN 250, enzyme replacement therapy, for the treatment of MPS IIIB, a<br>rapid and progressive neurodegenerative disease of young children. At the World Medical Meeting (sic) [WORLDSymposium] 2 weeks ago, we<br>updated results from both the dose escalation portion of the study part 1 and from part 2, which included patients that rolled over from the dose<br>escalation part. We're pleased to share that subjects in both parts of the study demonstrated cerebrospinal fluid glycosaminoglycan levels in the<br>normal range, as well as spleen and liver size reduction. In subjects who are rolled over the part 2 of the study, development quotient or DQ, is<br>trending in the right direction. We're very excited about the early results of this program, especially in light of the success we've experienced with<br>intracerebral ventricular delivery modality based on our Brineura patients. We expect to complete the feeder portion of the study where we track<br>development quotient for the first 12 months of enrollment and close enrollment in this quarter of 2018.<br>
We expect to have 1 year [deep] baseline data in the first quarter of 2019, so stay tuned for additional updates as the program progresses.<br>
And finally, as J.J. mentioned, we look forward to the Prescription Drug User Fee Action date at the end of May for pegvaliase. We're confident in<br>the fee lowering properties of pegvaliase, so we're hopeful that the immune response data are acceptable for an approval. Our current clinical trial<br>

patients are thrilled with the benefits they've experienced with pegvaliase. We're hoping that their voice will be heard as our application is reviewed<br>for potential approval and we look forward to keeping you apprised on our progress in the U.S. and our plans to submit the European Union<br>marketing authorization application later in the first quarter of this year for potential European approval in 2019.<br>
With that, operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs.<br>
<b>Salveen Jaswal Richter</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - VP<br>
So I just wanted to clarify your 2018 revenue guidance. You mentioned you can achieve guidance or you'll be in the range without pegvaliase<br>revenue, but just wondering what you've attributed to pegvaliase in '18. And then secondly, with regard to the pipeline, can you just comment on<br>how enrollment is progressing in the valrox pivotal trials?<br>
<b>Daniel K. Spiegelman</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, this is Dan. So I'll take the honor of not answering your question. So consistent with our prior practice, we don't give first year revenue guidance<br>specific to newly launched products. And we're going to continue that practice in 2018. And enrollment?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Similar context. As I said in my prepared remarks, the patient interest is phenomenal in this and we, more or less, essentially identified an abundant<br>-- a sufficiently abundant pool of patients to enroll. The gating factor is site activation, contracts, IRBs, et cetera, that's progressing smoothly as<br>predicted and our projection is that we'll complete enrollment in the first of the 2 studies by the end of the year with the second study coming in<br>after that. So although it's early, we're quite pleased with the track record of enrollment and patient identification.<br>

Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.<br>
<b>Cory William Kasimov</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Biotechnology Analyst<br>
A pipeline and a commercial one for me. So in the pipeline one, Hank, I wanted to ask about BMN 250 and how much follow-up you think you need<br>there before potentially moving to the pivotal program. Is that the 1-year DQ data you've just mentioned? And then I guess on that front, what do<br>you hope to see on that side to move forward? Is stabilization of DQ enough or you need improvement, too? And then, I have a follow-up for<br>commercial.<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
It's a little early to talk about the pivot to a subsequent study. I think what I -- the context I'd put on things now is that just a reminder that Brineura<br>got approved in the United States on the basis of 96-week data and in Europe on the basis of 72-week data. And finally, it was triggered actually<br>

on the basis of 48-week data, big credit goes to the health authorities for being able to include more updated data in the package inserts on the<br>basis of relatively rapid real-time review. So in the context of Brineura, 48 weeks by itself was enough. I -- we don't know about the efficacy of the<br>full cohort of patients at 48 weeks, so that's why it's premature to speculate. But what I'd say is, is that based on Brineura, we have made substantial<br>improvements in the 250 programs. Specifically, we're using the same exact tool to measure outcome in a natural history context as in the treatment<br>context. We're measuring those development quotient improvements in the same patients, not different patients. Those were -- that was a big<br>part of the Brineura review and we've eliminated that as a concern for the 250 application. In addition, unlike Brineura, in the case of 250, there's<br>a very good biomarker for biological activity of the product. And finally, unlike with Brineura where there were no systemic manifestations of the<br>disease to follow, we've already demonstrated normalization of liver size, which I'll remind you, has been a basis of approval for other enzyme<br>replacement therapies. So we're cautiously optimistic about the progress we've made with 250. I think that we're ahead of where we were at a<br>similar time in the case of Brineura and as to kind of what magnitude of improvement would trigger either another study or an application, I think<br>it's a matter of stay tuned.<br>
<b>Cory William Kasimov</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Biotechnology Analyst<br>
Okay, that's helpful. And then on the commercial front, assuming that pegvaliase is, indeed, approved in May, I can appreciate the slow and steady<br>initial launch curve, but how should we be thinking about some of the headwinds and tailwinds for this product? What do you see as the biggest<br>needle movers there that we should be thinking about?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
Yes, so Cory, I think the first thing I would say is the picture is simplified by the fact that we're only anticipating launching in the United States next<br>year. We have over 200 clinical trial patients, a majority of which we would expect to be able to transition to commercial during the course of the<br>year, assuming an approval date on or around our PDUFA. So that's a tailwind. For na�ve to treatment patients, we have to get through the induction<br>and titration phase. That would be something like a 12- to 24-week period on average, but also noting that some patients have taken longer than<br>24 weeks to reach a maintenance phase. During that period of time, patients will be taking a variety of doses. So we've got 3 prefilled syringe SKUs,<br>we would anticipate a 2.5-microgram, a 10-microgram and a 20-microgram dose. And so depending on the dosing schedule, there would be<br>fractional revenues during the induction titration phase, starting out at 1 syringe per week early in the induction and titration phase. So only<br>fractional revenue during induction and titration. And that would eat up the majority of the calendar year of 2018 for na�ve to treatment patients.<br>So if you consider that to be a bit of a headwind. In terms of new patient enrollment, 35 of the 125 PKU clinics in the United States have experience<br>using pegvaliase through the clinical trial program. So that gives us a good base of experience to start off from. And we know that those investigators<br>are interested in trialing new patients when pegvaliase is approved. We also know that they've guided that they would start patients in relatively<br>small batches. Think several -- or several-ish. Work them up through the initial induction and titration phase to something approaching maintenance<br>dosing and then starting the next batch of patients and so on. So that will be kind of a measured pace of new patient introduction of the pegvaliase.<br>And then for the about 90 PKU clinics in the United States that don't have experience through the clinical trial program, we have the usual education<br>process to get through before we would anticipate they would trial patients. We would anticipate and, in fact, guide those clinics to start with<br>several-ish patients, be very deliberate about having good experiences, good initial experiences with pegvaliase and then starting additional<br>patients. So it will be a measured start throughout 2018.<br>
<b>Jean-Jacques Bienaim�</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Jeff, you might want to add that the majority -- vast majority of the 200 patients that are currently on therapy, we will -- they will not need titration.<br>They can go into full commercial use in the second half of this year.<br>

<b>Christopher Joseph Raymond</b> - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst<br>
I've got actually 2 questions on pegvaliase, if that's okay. Just first, I'm curious on the decision to wait on starting a pediatric program until there's<br>an approval in adults. I think you guys have said that for a while. Can you maybe clarify, is this driven by FDA's direction or is this your decision?<br>And I guess, the reason I'm asking is it's kind of striking with today's announcement that you're starting an infant study for visoritide, sort of why<br>not apply maybe the same logic to pegvaliase? And then maybe on the commercial side, I was struck by your comments that revenue for titration<br>patients would be fractional. I thought I heard you guys say earlier that you would not be pricing this on a per milligram basis and rather by SKUs.<br>Can you maybe give a little bit more color? Should we think about it in terms of the amount of drug? Or is there some other measure?<br>
<b>Jean-Jacques Bienaim�</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Hank, you want to go pegvaliase?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Sure, thanks, Chris. The considerations with pegvaliase has all along been -- it's a foreign protein that's PEGylated within an elicited immune<br>response. We really wanted to build a good safety database before going into children. And that is an especially important consideration in the<br>context in which there is an alternative form of therapy for children, namely medical and nutritional therapy. And that's different -- that's one aspect<br>that's different from our other indications and another -- and therefore, sort of the ongoing accrual of damage is blunted in PKU as compared with<br>our other enzyme replacement therapy business. So I think those things, those 2 things combined, the nature of the product and wanting to build<br>a really strong safety database as well as the availability of medical and nutritional, the compliance with medical and nutritional therapy, which is<br>higher in children than it is in adults, suggests to us to take a more measured approach with these children. Now upon regulatory action, clearly,<br>that can be revisited.<br>
And Chris, on the subject of why the fractional revenue during the induction and titration phase. Thinking about pegvaliase patients in a maintenance<br>setting where they would likely be receiving either 20-milligram or 40-milligram per day maintenance dosing, we would be pricing principally on<br>expectations of how to price for maintenance dosing. I mentioned earlier that we're anticipating that we would have 3 different prefilled syringe<br>SKUs, 2.5-milligram syringe, 10-milligram syringe and 20-milligram syringe. In the United States, the most likely method of pricing pegvaliase would<br>be either pricing on a per milligram basis or pricing on a per syringe basis. In the maintenance space dose setting, imagine a 20-milligram per day<br>patient receiving 1 20-milligram syringe per day. In an induction and titration phase, same patient would be starting out at 1 2.5-milligram syringe,<br>once a week, and the frequency of that syringe use increasing, getting to the point of switching to a 10-milligram syringe and then all the way up<br>to a daily dose of 20-milligram in this case. So whether we price on a per syringe basis or a per milligram basis, during the induction and titration<br>phase, the patients would be getting a fractional price essentially during that period. And that fractional piece would be shifting from very low in<br>the range initially to higher in the range as they get further through the induction of the titration process.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
This is [Crip] on for Robyn. I too had actually a couple of pegvaliase questions. One question is about training the centers that did not participate<br>in the clinical trials. Do you have a plan in place for how you expect to train them? And can you talk about maybe a time line for when you expect<br>these centers to go online? And just to clarify, you said that they will -- the centers that are already online will treat several [LISH] patients in the<br>beginning. So do you expect them to take on these patients and then take them through the induction titration period before they start maintenance<br>trial and then only take on new patients?<br>

<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Maybe I'll start and Jeff can chime in. As far as the broadening from the 35 to 125, clearly, the 35 centers who have a lot of hands-on experience<br>with pegvaliase have learned a lot. And we've captured a lot of that learning and we intend to apply that learning to the other 90 that we need to<br>bring online. And yes, we have quite detailed plans, but in the current moment, what I want to say about that is, we can't really speak about what<br>those detailed plans are until the label for the product is final. So I think the context I'll leave you with, in the moment is, you better believe, we've<br>got seriously detailed plans for how to extend the learnings from the 35 to the 125. And as to how the commercial team is going to operationalize<br>and build on that, maybe Jeff wants to take over.<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
Yes. I think, thank you, Hank. A couple of the things that I think will be impactful in year 1 for the na�ve to experience clinics are, one, what we would<br>anticipate is a kind of a guidelines document to be published shortly after pegvaliase approval. We'll receive it at the end of May. That would be<br>one piece. And that the second piece would be to find kind of peer-to-peer opportunities to leverage the experience of the clinical trial investigators<br>to share with their non-experienced peers some tips and guidance on working through their initial patients. In terms of the induction and titration<br>phase, the maintenance and the notion of starting several patients, several [LISH] patients, getting them through the induction-titration phase<br>before starting additional patients, what we've heard the clinical trial investigators say is that, it's exactly the 12- to 24-week period that is normal<br>for induction and titration, that is the most intensive period for them to be managing dose adjustments, potential adverse events, that sort of thing.<br>Once they get through those, the dose adjustments and period where adverse events are most likely to occur, then the workload on those patients<br>goes down significantly. And it's exactly at that point that we would anticipate clinics would be receptive to starting additional patients into the<br>induction and titration phase again.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Great. And if I can sneak in one more question. Have you seen any interest from patients currently on Kuvan -- adult patients -- in pegvaliase?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
We have not entirely polled existing patients for their interest in pegvaliase. You'll recall that we can't go out and speak promotionally about<br>pegvaliase until it's approved. So I would anticipate there would be some interest, but I can't speak more specifically to that.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Philip Nadeau from Cowen and Company.<br>
<b>Philip M. Nadeau</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
One also on pegvaliase and one on BMN 250. The pegvaliase comments in your prepared remarks, you mentioned cautious optimism and you<br>specifically mentioned the FDA getting comfortable with immune reactions. It seemed like your comments are a bit more cautious today than<br>maybe what we've heard in the past. I'm just curious what was the reason for that? Is that coming from your interactions with the FDA or are you<br>simply erring on the side of conservatism?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
The latter. Just -- we're 3 months away from a PDUFA date and it isn't over until it's over. But I think it's worth providing a little bit more color on<br>kind of the review process. The tone of interaction is really positive. The (inaudible) review divisional report closely with a lot -- we had a<br>

patient-oriented drug development meeting that they requested, where they got a chance to hear from patients for real, on their own, in terms<br>of what the benefit of fee lowering is, what's the disadvantages of current therapy -- benefit and nutritional therapy are, that agency had an<br>opportunity to dig in, in detail about what are the adverse experiences like? What is management of the adverse experiences like? What are you<br>looking for patients in the long haul? And I think that interaction was very positive and people came away enthusiastic. As you know, from public<br>disclosures of the FDA process, the FDA undertakes many activities in parallel during the late stages in review, which include consideration of<br>post-approval requirements, risk management planning, labeling, process control validation, specification setting. All of these activities are on<br>track, proceeding quite nicely. So really, no change from where we've been and the message is that process is not final until the process is final.<br>
<b>Philip M. Nadeau</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
Got it. That's very helpful. And then second question on BMN 250. At the R&amp;D Day that you held last year, I think Dr. Cleary presented a natural<br>history data on about 20 patients. I'm curious. Is that -- was that the full natural history database that you have access to or is it larger? It seems like<br>that the robust natural history data that you had was important to getting Brineura approved. So I'm curious. How robust is the package that you<br>have in MPS IIIB?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Well, as I -- the package is going to be substantially more robust. And the reasons for that are -- and if you're -- if you go back to the Brineura review,<br>we were talking about where is the FDA's focus? And we had said comparability of endpoints and comparability of patients. And that was driven<br>by the fact that the patients in the control setting were different patients than the patients in the treatment setting. And those control patients<br>were assessed using a set of tools that were developed by an academic, whereas the tools that we used were more drug industry appropriate tools<br>-- similar conceptually, but not literally the same. In contrast, we are generating a roughly comparably-sized natural history data set, but in this<br>case with 250, we're using the same tools for natural history as for treatment. And now the tools will be -- the evaluations will be in the same patients<br>before treatment and after treatment. So we think that the actual natural history database that we're building, and again, it depends on the<br>magnitude of treatment benefit, will be actually quite robust for interpretation of treatment benefit signals.<br>

This is Carlos in for Andrew. Following up on BMN 250. Some of the early data has begun to emerge for gene therapy in some of these enzyme<br>replacement therapies. So how would you think about the competitive landscape going forward? And how can you position your current portfolio<br>as well as for position to R&amp;D franchise to compete in this direction?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Yes, so, I mean, it's worth taking a little bit of a step back in terms of competition. You can probably (inaudible) in general, it's obviously been<br>relatively fertile area for drug development. However, the MPS III family of disorders has been a little bit more challenging because the disease is<br>principally a brain disease or one of the most important (inaudible) are in the CNS. And given the blood-brain barrier, it's been a difficult nut to<br>crack. As you know, companies have tried sort of a subtler approaches like lumbar intrathecal delivery of relatively low doses and, unfortunately,<br>Shire abandoned a program in IIIa with that approach after having gone on a clinical hold for device-related complications. Also, as you know,<br>Synageva, then Alexion had a program of IV delivery and had initially demonstrated some potential evidence of biological activity in the central<br>nervous system after intravenous delivery. But unfortunately, at the most recent world conference, those effects just didn't appear to hold up or<br>be real. And so I think the take-home messages there are: blood-brain barrier challenges are significant and not easily navigated. Now we come to<br>more recent undertakings and another company is taking an intravenous delivery approach using gene therapy to address the blood-brain barrier,<br>

have some initial signals of activity and reduction in CSF GAGs. We have published that you really need to correct to normal the accumulation of<br>the pathological species of GAGs. And it remains to be seen whether that can be achieved from the blood [side] of the blood-brain barrier. Our<br>strategy has been the disease, the central nervous system disease, we can make a protein to deliver it directly into the central nervous system, right<br>into the -- -- where the action is in the brain. And that approach has actually proved successful already. So we like our chances. We're aware of the<br>competition. We think there are some big challenges to the competitors, but time will tell.<br>
<b>Jean-Jacques Bienaim�</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
And Hank, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we are the only company that has shown normalization of heparan sulfate levels. I mean, all the other<br>companies report reduction in heparan sulfate levels, but none of them so far have been able to prove normalization.<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Yes. Thanks, J.J. And that's especially important because we showed that subtotal reductions in glycosaminoglycan species do not actually collect<br>correct the [HIPA] pathological phenotype of the disease in experimental animals. So we really think you have to knock the pathology all the way<br>down to normal and nobody's done that yet, except for us.<br>
<b>Carlos Efrain Solorzano-Say</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Associate<br>
Okay. And if I may, just a follow-up on the pipeline on the BMN 290 program. At the R&amp;D Day, you guys discussed how BMN 290 is selective for<br>HDAC-3 over 1 and 2, if we understood the data correctly. And how this could overcome some of the side effects that have been seen with other<br>class 1 HDAC inhibitors. So my question would be where is HDAC expressed in the body and, specifically, in the brain? And what side effects might<br>you expect with BMN 290?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Well, histone deacetylases are used commonly throughout every cell of the body and you're right to point out that there are different classes of --<br>different isoforms of HDACs. From our preclinical studies, it appears that mild suppression appears to be the most relevant dose limiting toxicity.<br>But we are -- or because of the design of BMN 290, we were able to achieve tissue concentrations of BMN 290, which are inducing frataxin upregulation<br>to a substantial degree and at levels which are lower than the doses that cause mild suppression. Now obviously, that's all preclinical work and the<br>essential clinical question will be whether we can establish a positive therapeutic index, that is to say, frataxin upregulation without accompanying<br>mild suppression. We're cautiously optimistic based on our preclinical data that we can do that, but human clinical experiments will be required<br>to demonstrate that. Now one of the other important points to make here is that because the upregulation of frataxin is specific to the disease<br>allele, this can only be done in diseased patients. And the initial target population of our investigations will be patients. So we'll get an answer very<br>quickly.<br>

<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
I think the key gating factor is going to be an evaluation of the effectiveness there from the first cohort of patients that have been treated for a<br>year, which I said probably won't be until about 2020. So stay tuned for further updates there. But just to remind you, we're going to complete<br>enrollment in the natural history cohort in the first quarter of '18. Those patients will be followed for a year through '19. They'll roll over onto a<br>treatment starting in the first quarter -- the end of the enrollment -- in the treated patients will be in the first quarter of '19. Those patients will take<br>a year of treatment and that's why I got 2020 for the first signal, the sort of the first comprehensive signal of activity data from the initial treatment<br>cohort. So stay tuned. Relative to your question about Brineura ex-U. S. reimbursement. I think we've noted before that the -- of the 40...<br>
(technical difficulty)<br>
Of the 40 or more patients on commercial therapy at the end of 2017, many of those were located in approximately 6 ex-U. S. commercial markets:<br>2 in Latin America; 4 in Europe. And the reimbursement for those patients is on a named patient or named patient-like basis, while we navigate<br>the full reimbursement and price approval process that we have to get through in most markets. The commercial patients in Europe would be<br>coming from each of Germany, France, Italy and the U.K. And in each of those markets, you know there's varied prescribed set of activities that<br>sponsors need to get through to attain reimbursement approvals and a price level. We are in the midst of navigating that system right now and<br>we anticipate getting through that process in those key markets and other markets during the course of 2018. And we think that having navigated<br>that system and attaining full price and reimbursement status in certain markets will allow patients easier access to commercial Brineura therapy<br>relative to the named patient or named patient like approvals that have been attained so far.<br>

Your next question comes from the line of Laura Chico from Raymond James.<br>
<b>Hamzah Qudsi</b><br>
This is Hamzah on for Laura Chico. One on pricing strategy and gene therapy. As you're thinking about various gene therapy pricing strategies, are<br>there certain payment models that make more sense than others within the hemophilia space?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
J.J. did you want to think that one?<br>
<b>Jean-Jacques Bienaim�</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Jeff, why don't you go take it.<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
Yes. So payment models are a key variable for gene therapies. We're seeing how that's playing out already with the initial approvals in the U.S. and<br>Europe of initial products. In the United States, some of the models that have been discussed, which might include payment over time, payment<br>for positive results, something like a rebate for patients that don't respond adequately, those models are going to be challenging to implement<br>unless they're -- until the problem of how to account for government price calculations is solved for. There may be solutions for that, but that's a<br>barrier to implementing those kinds of programs in the United States. And outside of the United States, in single-payer like models, those kind of<br>reimbursement models are probably easier to navigate and impossible to implement. And from BioMarin's perspective, I think, our principal interest<br>in pricing reimbursement model is to be able to capture as much value as possible as valrox may provide: number one on a clinical value basis;<br>

Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital.<br>
<b>Mayur Amrat Somaiya</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Analyst<br>
I have 2. First on valrox and vosoritide, 2 products which you've spoken excitedly about or enthusiastically about in the past. I'm just curious given<br>the uniqueness of those products and the market place, what type of investments are going to be required. If you could speak to sort of the<br>commercial investments, whether there are structural changes that might be required or from a manufacturing standpoint. And the second question<br>was just on business development. You're clearly at a sort of a period of stable growth with visibility into high-growth associated with both of these<br>products. How does that influence your BD decisions and the type of assets and opportunities you might pursue?<br>
<b>Daniel K. Spiegelman</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
This is Dan. Maybe I'll take a stab at the cost structure question and then maybe J.J. you want to do the BD question. Cost structure-wise, frankly,<br>neither vosoritide nor valrox would be materially different than what we've dealt with in the past. As you know, from a manufacturing standpoint,<br>actually the initial commercial scaling manufacturing plant is done. We've talked about being able to handle 2,000 to 3,000 patients a year out of<br>that facility. There are things we could potentially do to even expand that and for additional demand we can to construct capacity either here or<br>elsewhere. Commercial structures would be -- and resources, would be similar to what we've utilized in the past. It would be a different call point<br>and a different sales force, but all the infrastructure is in place and the same for vosoritide. So nothing dramatically or materially different that but<br>we're ready and lined up for. J.J. do you want to take business development?<br>
<b>Jean-Jacques Bienaim�</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Yes, I mean, on the business development front, as you know, we always, on an ongoing basis, analyze potential opportunities. I would say<br>considering the very significant pipeline that we have and the fact that it's likely we will add new projects, we're probably going to announce 1 or<br>2 new projects before the end of the year, which would be pretty significant projects. I would say our appetite for large transformational deal is<br>relatively low at this time -- that could change -- but however, we are always interested in earlier stage opportunities that would be strategically<br>coherent with our overall strategy of continuing to develop first-in-class or best-in-class products for rare genetic disorders. I mean, obviously,<br>because of the size of the company now, we are achieving $1.5 billion of revenues this year, I would say, unlikely we will move much or continue<br>to -- or develop products for ultra or ultra-orphan or very, very small patient population. But we, at this time, are planning to stick within the orphan<br>space. In the orphan space, there are plenty of opportunities and it will be a combination of large molecules, peptides, small molecules and of<br>course, gene therapy. So that's kind of where we stand today.<br>

I mean, that could be one of them. But there is another, at least one other potential project that<br>we probably will feel comfortable to announce before the end of the year. So what's the trigger for us is that when we have done all the work and<br>all the preclinical analysis that makes us comfortable that we are willing to move towards pre-IND activities and move towards initiating earlier<br>clinical trials. So we're getting to a point, it's likely that it will happen for 1 or 2 of them between now and end of the year, though I mean, they<br>would not be 2018 and '19, but likely mid-2019 or early '20.

I was just wondering if you could comment on the distribution of maintenance pegvaliase doses amongst the 200 trial patients that are receiving<br>the drug under expanded access.

What I say is that -- first of all, I'm not going to give the confidential information of the distribution other than to say that the vast majority of patients<br>are satisfied by 20 and 40 milligrams. And as far as projecting how the trial is going to read on the marketplace, I'd just remind you that a really<br>important piece of this is the actual product label and until we finalize that with the FDA, it would be speculative to give you any more information.<br>I think at the time of the approval of product when we have the actual label in hand, we can be a little bit more concrete.<br>

Your next question comes from the line of Jing He from Gabelli.<br>
<b>Jing He</b> - G. Research, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
First on 250. I'm just wondering, the trend in brain volume and ventricular volume are less obvious than they were [size] decrease and stabilizing<br>cognitive function. So I guess, how important are these measures clinically? And also, do you think 300 mg is enough?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Well, let me start with the second part. 300 milligrams is totally normalized CSF GAG. So I suppose you could ask the question of whether 300<br>milligrams might be a little too much. But we don't want to make the mistake that others have made by under-dosing and, therefore, giving too<br>little efficacy. And then as far as other surrogate parameters reading on main efficacy parameters, the more important of the parameters, clearly,<br>are the clinical efficacy parameters. We saw, in the case of Brineura, for example, quite dramatic effects on stabilization of loss of [ambulation] and<br>progression of loss of ambulation, for example. And maybe a little less dramatic effects on CSF brain volume. So the good news is that the clinical<br>outcome variables were the important ones. They carry the day and that's what we're hoping to observe in our 250 program when the cohort is<br>fully mature.<br>
<b>Jing He</b> - G. Research, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
Also, could you help us understand your Brineura guidance? What would it take to achieve your low end versus high end of your 2018 guidance?<br>Is the driver mainly diagnosis in the U.S. or launching ex-U. S. countries?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
It's really a combination of those variables. We have approval in the United States and across the EU now. So we have regulatory access to a number<br>of markets. We're pursuing additional registrations at this time and then inside of those markets, as I've noted outside of the United States, we're<br>navigating price and reimbursement systems and we're also pursuing early identification of treatment.

Couple of follow-ups on pricing and reimbursement. The first is, as you alluded to earlier, one key aspect of the value in capture for gene therapy<br>would be potential for a longer term multi-year value-based pricing. You're arguably further ahead when it comes to bringing a gene therapy to<br>market for a relatively large indication. What's your level of optimism with respect to being able to achieve some of these more creative pricing<br>structures in the U.S? And what is the path to get there from where we are today?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
Yes. So as I noted earlier, I think that we -- in general, and outside of the United States, we're highly interested and motivated to pursue creative<br>strategies that allows us to capture the value that's provided by valrox. And value is typically thought of on the basis of cost offsets, but there's so<br>much more potentially value that this program offers in terms of quality of life and better clinical outcomes. So we want to capture value across<br>all 3 of those dimensions. And you're absolutely right. Pricing over time, based on durability of effect, for example, could be an excellent vehicle<br>for allowing us to do that. In the United States, there are some practical implications to Medicaid pricing reports that manufacturers must do and<br>that needs to be solved for before some of these more creative programs can be implemented in the United States. A potential solution would be<br>CMS approving so-called demonstration projects or programs that would be submitted by a sponsor like a BioMarin. That could potentially happen.<br>There could be legislative fixes for this on the logic that the original Medicaid legislation that put all these pricing calculations in play in the first<br>place was based on a healthcare system that (inaudible) since 30 years ago, but has been overtaken by innovative advancements like gene therapy<br>today. So I think we're cautiously optimistic, but there needs to be some things that happen to allow us to solve for that and they probably won't<br>happen overnight.<br>
<b>Vincent Chen</b> - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division - VP<br>

I can tell you some of the feedback that we have gotten from payers on that subject. So subject to the ability to control for free-rider problem,<br>free-rider problem being, for example, (inaudible) for major payers cover for valrox or another gene therapy and one doesn't, creating a free-rider<br>problem. The initial view of the insurers that I've heard is that they would expect the flux in the patients to be relatively the same of flux out of<br>patients. And so the portability problem is not a primary problem for them. It's something that they're interested in and they're thinking about.<br>But it's not their primary barrier to wanting to proceed with payment over time model -- or sorry, a pay upfront model.<br>

One for Hank on the safety. I wanted to get your perspective on the recent article from [Dr. Weston's] lab with concerns surrounding the safety of<br>high-dose AAV vector specifically, whether this is sort of unique to the AAV9 that you've used in this study or perhaps you need to do the pigs and<br>monkeys again that you've used in this preclinical study. And then one for Jeff again. On pegvaliase long term, is there something we should be<br>thinking about growing in the market here in the U.S. sort of beyond the 7% year-over-year growth that we saw for Kuvan over the last year? Or<br>should we be anticipating that growth is really going to come from transferring Kuvan patients to pegvaliase and the pricing premium there that<br>you have mentioned.<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Yes. So as hard as it is to compare across clinical trials in humans of similar agents, it's -- I would say impossible to compare across different vectors,<br>capsids and species. But for some muscular atrophy, there may be some relevance of the findings, I don't know, not an area that we're in. In our<br>area, we have human clinical data on the safety of the doses that we're using. And I think the human safety data are the important consideration<br>for our product.<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
Relative to your question about pegvaliase potential over time. In the United States, there's approximately 4,000 adult PKU patients that are being<br>treated in clinics today, 1/3 of which are presently on Kuvan. At launch, our focus will be the 2/3 of adult PKU patients that are not presently on<br>Kuvan. So we will be focusing very hard on getting incremental access to a bigger portion of the PKU market, and we think that, that would be<br>delivering more than incremental revenue, PKU revenue in total. Beyond launch, we have a motivation to help Kuvan adult patients that are not<br>adequately controlled on Kuvan or not as well as controlled as they would like to be to trial pegvaliase on the logic that we will likely face limitations<br>in our Kuvan exclusivity in a couple of years.<br>

The bulk of the trial will include<br>patients who are treated using that same IIB commercialized process, but manufactured in our Novato facility at the IIB commercialized scale of<br>manufacture. We believe that sufficient comparability of the data from the contractor to the BioMarin facility at scale will enable us to pool the<br>patients from smaller first part of the study to the larger second part of the study. If that turns out not to be the case, we can simply expand the<br>size of the larger portion of the trial for pivotal purposes.<br>

Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chan.<br>
<b>Vincent Chen</b> - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division - VP<br>
One quick question on pegvaliase. As you look towards launch and speak to payers, what are you hearing with the likely coverage guidelines for<br>pegvaliase and how this could potentially vary by pricing. From what you've heard, are there some payers that might require patient to potentially<br>fail (inaudible) or Kuvan if pegvaliase is indeed more costly?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
Yes. So we have conducted payer research not surprisingly, in the run-up to our PDUFA date and we've gotten a mix of feedback from payers.<br>Generally speaking, I would say that the payers are comfortable with the notion of lowering phenylalanine levels as an adequate measure of<br>managing PKU. So that's very good for pegvaliase. And payers are very comfortable, obviously, with their reimbursement of Kuvan. So that sets a<br>good baseline also going into the potential approval of a next-generation therapy. Beyond that, in terms of coverage policies, we've gotten a variety<br>of feedback, but nothing that would be suggestive of kind of hard and strict policies across-the-board of step therapy or failures on Kuvan or that<br>sort of thing. It's possible, but we could see some of that creep in initial coverage policies, however.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
There are no further questions at this time.<br>
<b>Traci McCarty</b><br>
Okay. We'd like to turn over to J.J. to make his final comments and then we'll say goodbye for the day. Thank you.<br>
<b>Jean-Jacques Bienaim�</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Thank you. So thank you, operator. Thank you, Traci. So in summary, 2017 was a defining year for BioMarin as we firmly established our leadership<br>position among rare disease companies. Not only did our development pipeline progress across every program, our Commercial business to a<br>record revenues to over $1.3 billion.<br>
In 2018, we expect topline revenue growth of 15% to 19% per our full year revenue guidance of between $1.47 billion to $1.53 billion. In 2018, in<br>next stage development, we'll see continued enrollment in valrox and vosoritide paving the way for anticipated data results in 2019.<br>
In late May, at the scheduled PDUFA, we hope to receive the U.S. pegvaliase approval. We are all well-equipped the execute a successful launch<br>and given the 10 years of direct experience working with the PKU community, either directly with Kuvan patients and care providers or those who<br>

Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on the conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release and the Investor<br>Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.<br>
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Matt Calkins. Matt?<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Thank you, [Kevin], and thank you all for joining us today. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Appian subscription revenue grew 42% year-over-year to<br>$23.5 million. Our non-GAAP loss from operations was $4.9 million compared to the loss of $1.8 million in the prior year quarter.<br>
We were cash flow positive in Q4, generating $1 million in cash flow from operations. Our subscription revenue retention remained high at 122%<br>as of December 31, 2017. Our professional services revenue was also high at $25.2 million with non-GAAP gross margin of 37%.<br>
For the full year, subscription revenue grew by 38% to $82.8 million. And finally, of net new subscription customers for all of 2017, we added 85<br>versus 28 in the prior year. These results exceeded our guidance.<br>
Appian's growth in 2017 has a lot to do with being in the right place, being well positioned. The positioning is very simple. Companies today need<br>to build unique software applications. Traditional methods are expensive and slow. Appian has an easy answer. We let customers draw an application<br>like a flowchart, rather than code it. We let them assemble an application from premade objects like reusable LEGO bricks. This approach is 6 to<br>20x faster than a regular development. Best of all, the applications built on our platform are powerful. They're scalable, secure, cloud-ready, highly<br>available and native on all major mobile devices.<br>
Appian applications run banks, airports, insurers, retailers, et cetera. We're making it easy to build unique industrial-strength software. That's an<br>ability the world is excited to buy right now.<br>
Our goal in 2018 is to bring this simple winning proposition to more customers. We're learning a lot about how large organizations want to build<br>and use unique software. We channel this knowledge back into vertical marketing and sales campaigns, some of which showed great success in<br>2017. In pharma, for example, we grew subscription revenue 53% over the full year. Currently, 6 of the top 10 pharma companies use Appian to<br>manage critical business processes like clinical trials management and pharmacovigilance. In Q4, we had new and expansion wins at 3 of the top<br>5 global pharmaceutical companies, and pharma subs revenue grew 70% versus the prior year period.<br>
The first of these large wins was a significant expansion deal at an existing multi -- an existing $1 million-per-year customer. With this deal, which<br>doubles their annual spend with us, they'll now use Appian to deliver new medical devices to market, replacing a sprawled -- homegrown apps<br>and spreadsheets.<br>
Among the significant new name wins was a European multinational pharmaceutical customer who plans to use Appian to manage its<br>pharmacovigilance process. Their application will manage drug safety reporting and replace a disjointed mix of systems including Microsoft<br>SharePoint, Lotus Notes, databases and e-mail.<br>
We were selected over 2 large competitors because we successfully delivered a powerful application during a 2-day proof of concept.<br>
Following the win, we developed and deployed the full solution in 9 weeks. I mention this to highlight our speed edge. We're fast to show value,<br>and a 2-day POC, or proof of concept, suits us very well, but we're also remarkably quick to get full applications into production.<br>
Our European investments over the past few years bore fruit in 2017. In Q4, European revenue was 20% of total revenue as compared to 11% in<br>the prior year period. For all of 2017, European subscription revenue rose 91%, and total revenue doubled year-over-year. Notably, Europe also<br>provided 32 net new subscription customers in 2017. In Europe, we gained one of the world's major beverage companies as a new customer in<br>Q4. They wanted to replace their restaurant leasing system, currently running on paper, Excel and e-mail, with a more scalable and transparent<br>

solution. They chose Appian over 2 large competitors after we showed superior alignment with their team and a fully integrated application in a<br>short proof of concept.<br>
We also had a number of key Q4 expansion deals in Europe. We won a multimillion-dollar deal at MHRA, a governmental agency in the United<br>Kingdom. We added $1 million follow-on deals at 2 of the top 20 global banks and at GRDF, an energy service company that serves 90% of the gas<br>market in France.<br>
GRDF became a customer in 2015 with the purchase of 2,500 user licenses. Over the last 2.5 years, they've expanded their use of Appian by building<br>more applications and adding more users opportunistically. With our platform, they've improved service to their 11 million customers by better<br>managing gas supplier requests, energy loss, gas and network extensions and meter connections.<br>
In 2017, GRDF wanted a more strategic relationship and to use Appian globally so they increased their investment to allow them to grow to 10,000<br>users.<br>
Perhaps the most important trend in our business today is the one towards stronger partnerships. Partners are sourcing more business for us. In<br>2017, the total value of partner-referred deals was 3.5x as much as in 2016. Partners brought us 30 new customers last year, which was more than<br>Appian's total increase in new customers in 2016.<br>
Here's a quick example to show how partner relationships facilitate our growth in new places. In Q4, we pursued a $1 million deal in Poland with<br>a large global bank. They wanted to modernize their operations on a platform with strong Robotic Process Automation and case management<br>capabilities. We're leaders in both of those markets, so we're an excellent fit. But because Poland is new to us, we relied on Deloitte's strong local<br>presence and capabilities. Our technical strength and our partnership with Deloitte won this deal against 2 major competitors.<br>
In addition to significantly increasing our subscription customer base in 2017, we were also more successful on a per-customer basis. The average<br>ACV for our 2017 new customers was slightly higher than in 2016, indicating that we maintained deal quality as we captured more customers.<br>
We also raised our average revenue per customer to $496,000.<br>
Finally, for the past 3 years, we maintained an LTV to CAC ratio above 7. We showed value quickly, and we gained quick upsells. For example, there's<br>a large U.S. bank who bought our software last September. We delivered their first application within 5 weeks. As a result, they expanded their<br>investment in Appian with a multimillion-dollar purchase just 3 months following their initial order.<br>
In our judgment, the market opportunity, combined with Appian's demonstrated ability to reach and satisfy that market warrants an incremental<br>increase in investment in 2018. As you may know, investment is not Appian's first instinct, even in a growing market. We broke even, roughly, on<br>a cash flow basis from the day we were founded to our IPO last May. We are instinctively frugal. We plan a $10 million acceleration in our expenditures<br>for 2018, and our justification for this is as follows. First, our market shows high growth potential. We grew full year subs revenue 38% and we more<br>than tripled our rate of new logo acquisition in 2017. Second, our technology creates good outcomes, and our customers are happy. Here, I cite<br>our 122% NRRR and our high LTV to CAC ratio. Third, and finally, we are more able to serve and sustain growth in the business than we were before,<br>thanks to a higher profile and greater partner support. Due to these factors, we believe now is an opportune time for a reasonable level of additional<br>investment.<br>
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for a deeper discussion of our financials. Mark?<br>
<b>Mark Lynch</b> - Appian Corporation - CFO<br>
Thanks, Matt. This was another strong quarter for Appian. I'll review the financial highlights of the quarter and then provide details on our Q1 and<br>full year 2018 guidance.<br>

<A name=472></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, APPN.OQ - Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call<br>
Subscription revenue was $23.5 million for the fourth quarter, ahead of our guidance, and representing growth of 42% year-over-year. Q4 linearity<br>was better than historical trends, which was helped by a number of deals being completed early in the quarter.<br>
We believe our subscription revenue growth is the most relevant revenue metric on our P&amp;L when evaluating the momentum of our business and<br>market share gains. Our total subscription software and support revenue for the quarter was $25.4 million.<br>
Professional services revenue in the fourth quarter was $25.2 million, up 14% compared to Q3 2017. The significant growth in services year-over-year<br>is due to the low compare in Q4 2016, coupled with a surge in net new customers during the second half of 2017. We have said many times that<br>customers often spend more on services in their first years compared to later years, and the surge in new customers was met by a surge in professional<br>services work. As we continue to work with our partners, we do not expect services to grow in this manner in the future.<br>
Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $50.6 million, up 50% year-over-year. Our subscription revenue retention rate was 122% as of December<br>31, 2017, which was above the 110% to 120% range that we would expect on a quarterly basis. We are pleased with our customers' expanded use<br>of our platform, which speaks directly to the value they are realizing. We ended the year with 291 subscription customers, adding 85 net new during<br>the year. This compares to 206 subscription customers and the addition of 28 net new for 2016. We ended 2017 with 356 total customers compared<br>to 280 at the end of 2016. Our international business contributed 30% of total revenue for Q4 and 27% for the full year compared with 23% and<br>20%, respectively, in the prior year periods.<br>
Now I'll turn to our profitability metrics. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64% compared to 69% in the same period last year.<br>If we look at the 2 different components of our gross margin, you will see that they are both elite. Subscription software and support non-GAAP<br>gross margin was 91% for the fourth quarter compared to 90% in the fourth quarter of 2016.<br>
Our non-GAAP professional services gross margin for the fourth quarter remained higher than typical at 36%. Total non-GAAP operating expenses<br>for the fourth quarter were $37.1 million, an increase of 48% from $25 million in the year-ago period. Sales and marketing was 44% of revenue in<br>the fourth quarter compared with 43% of revenue in the prior year period. We continue to make investments to grow our direct sales headcount,<br>both in the U.S. and internationally, support our technology and channel partners in marketing initiatives to drive awareness. With our powerful<br>customer economics and strong subscription revenue retention, you should see accelerated investments on our sales and marketing functions.<br>
R&amp;D was 17% of revenue in the fourth quarter, down from 18% of revenue in the year-ago period. On a dollar basis, R&amp;D remains a key area of<br>investment, further differentiating the platform and adding in vertical-specific functionality.<br>
G&amp;A as a percentage of revenue was 13% in the fourth quarter compared to 13% in the prior year but will continue to increase on a dollar basis as<br>we invest in our infrastructure as a public company.<br>
Non-GAAP loss from operations in the fourth quarter was $4.9 million, well ahead of our guidance of a loss of $9.7 million to $9.2 million and<br>compared to a non-GAAP loss from operations of $1.8 million in the year-ago period.<br>
As you know, foreign exchange gains and losses can fluctuate. During the fourth quarter, we had $0.3 million of foreign exchange gains compared<br>to $1.5 million of foreign exchange losses in Q4 2016.<br>
Our guidance does not consider any additional potential impact to financial and other income and expenses associated with foreign exchange<br>gains or losses as we do not estimate movements in foreign currency exchange rates.<br>
Non-GAAP net loss was $4.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 or a loss of $0.08 per basic and diluted share compared to non-GAAP net loss of<br>$4.2 million or a loss of $0.08 per basic and diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. This is based on 60.4 million and 52.4 million basic and<br>diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.<br>
Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, we had cash and cash equivalents of $73.8 million compared with $72.3 million as of September<br>30, 2017. Total deferred revenue was $89.1 million, up 27% year-over-year. With respect to our billing terms, the majority of our customers are<br>

invoiced on an annual upfront basis. However, we also have some large customers that are billed quarterly and others that are billed monthly. As<br>such, we will continue to remind investors that changes in our deferred revenue are not always indicative of the momentum in the business.<br>
Backlog as of December 31, 2017, was $214 million compared with $167 million as of December 31, 2016. For the fourth quarter, we generated $1<br>million in cash flow from operations. For 2017, we used $9.2 million in cash flow from operations as compared with $7.8 million used in the prior<br>year period.<br>
Now I will quickly recap full year 2017 results. Subscription revenue was $82.8 million, representing growth of 38% year-over-year. Our total<br>subscription software and support revenue for the year was $91.5 million. Professional services revenue for 2017 was $85.2 million, up 35% compared<br>to 2016.<br>
Total revenue for 2017 was $176.7 million, up 33% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss from operations for the year was $18.8 million compared with<br>a loss of $11.4 million in 2016.<br>
Non-GAAP net loss was $17.3 million in 2017 or a loss of $0.30 per basic and diluted share compared to non-GAAP net loss of $12.3 million or a loss<br>of $0.23 per basic and diluted share for 2016. This is based on 57 million and 52.4 million basic and diluted shares outstanding for 2017 and 2016,<br>respectively.<br>
Now turning to guidance. First of all, I'd like to remind the listeners that we are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jobs Act. As a result,<br>we have decided not to adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for<br>other public companies. In particular, we will defer adoption of the new revenue accounting standard topic 606 until January 1, 2019.<br>
In addition, we do not believe the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will have a material impact on Appian's financials as long as<br>Appian continues to report tax losses domestically and internationally and maintains a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.<br>
For the full year 2018, subscription revenue is expected to be in the range of $106.5 million and $107.5 million, representing year-over-year growth<br>of between 29% and 30%. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $198.1 million and $201.1 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is<br>expected to be in the range of $39.9 million and $37.9 million with a non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.54 and $0.53. (sic-see press release &quot;$0.65<br>and $0.62&quot;) This assumes 61.1 million basic and diluted common shares outstanding.<br>
For the first quarter of 2018, subscription revenue is expected to be in the range of $24.4 million and $24.6 million, representing year-over-year<br>growth of 30% to 31%. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $46 million and $46.2 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected<br>to be in the range of $10.9 million and $10.5 million with a non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.18 and $0.17. This assumes 60.6 million basic and<br>diluted common shares outstanding.<br>
Our guidance reflects our stated strategy to invest for growth, to capture the long-term opportunity and build on our momentum. Given our high<br>gross margins and subscription revenue, along with our powerful LTV to CAC metrics, we think it makes sense to continue to invest in the business,<br>to capture new consumers and capitalize on the big upsell opportunity.<br>

<A name=474></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, APPN.OQ - Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Sanjit Kumar Singh</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - VP<br>
I wanted to dig in a little bit into, Mark, the guidance for next year. Was really happy to see the strong net new customer adds. It seemed like it grew<br>over 40% in 2017. But in terms of at least relative to where our model was, didn't see a whole lot of upside in terms of subscription revenue guidance.<br>So I just wanted to understand the dynamics there as it relates to guidance, whether it's some conservatism or you expect some of the contribution<br>from these customers to flow through over a multiyear period.<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
I'll cut in on that, if you don't mind. First of all, thank you for highlighting what I think is one of the best stats to come out of this quarter, the net<br>new customer adds. I think that bodes really well for us going forward, and it's a highlight for me. I also love the fact that those net new customer<br>adds came without dilution in quality. So we're still getting an excellent average customer value. And I believe that also reflects -- I mean, we're<br>not diluting it. We're just getting more of the same in terms of customer. So I think the potential of those is very high. That said, I don't want to<br>make any assumptions about how they're going to develop. Appian sales cycles tend to be long, and I want to be open-minded about how long<br>it would take a customer to develop and move forward. I think it's a good indicator. But as we've said many times, Appian is aiming at 30% growth,<br>and we are -- we plan to make estimates that are in line with that as we have. And so we're being careful about that, and we're delighted to see<br>the new wave of customers. But we're going to wait and see how it plays out.<br>
<b>Sanjit Kumar Singh</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - VP<br>
Great. And then a couple of things maybe on gross margins, particularly on the professional services side. They've held above 35% for most of the<br>year. I wanted to get your view on whether -- are those types of gross margin on the professional services side sustainable? And then the same sort<br>of similar question on the retention rate, sort of hovering around that 120% range, which is kind of well above what you guys saw in 2016. And so<br>wanted to get your view on the sustainability of those trends on those 2 metrics.<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Great. Okay. I'll take that one also. The professional services margins, you're right. These have been really, really elite level margins, and we do not<br>intend to maintain that level of margin. We've been pleased to see it come in, but it is not our business to maximize professional services profits.<br>Our plan with regards to professional services is to be consultative and encourage success amongst our customers, not to make the last possible<br>dollar out of those relationships. We have had traditionally high prices, and that was largely so that we could create a price vacuum under our price<br>point and encourage our partners to fill that vacuum and build healthy Appian-centric businesses. But with regards to the net market for Appian-centric<br>services, we plan and expect to continue to lose market share in that market. We don't want to sustain our place in it. And as we become smaller<br>and more consultative, I expect those margins to drop. With regards to your second question, which was, can we sustain the 122% revenue retention<br>that we reported this quarter, and I believe exactly the same thing last quarter? We are -- we like to estimate between 110% and 120% in net revenue<br>retention. I'm delighted to see it higher. I think it makes a really good statement about the experience that our customers are getting. And you bet,<br>we're asking for a lot. We ask professional services to deliver a lot in terms of happy customers and revenue retention, but we're comfortable<br>estimating that 110% to 120% is where this business belongs.<br>
<b>Sanjit Kumar Singh</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - VP<br>
Great. And then my last question in terms of the margin guidance. It looks like we're going to see an accelerated pace of investments going into<br>next year. In terms of where we're going to see that investment within sales and marketing, is that hiring quota-carrying reps to the sort of same<br>level you saw last year in 2017 -- and we think about the mix between domestic and international, any sort of color you can provide on that in terms<br>of where these investments are going?<br>

<A name=475></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, APPN.OQ - Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Yes, that's right. Okay, we're absolutely going to hire quota-carrying reps with some of that additional investment. And that, of course, drives a lot<br>of the company investment. You bring on a rep, then you got to staff them with BDRs and solutions consultants and appropriate marketing and<br>lead gen. And so you make your decision about adding new reps and then you kind of bring the entourage behind it. So that's driving a lot of the<br>structure around the spend. It will be largely sales and marketing spend, I can tell you that. And we will not neglect the growth in Europe. It's one<br>of our top growth areas in 2017. As we mentioned, the 91% subscription revenue was particularly impressive, and we want to feed that strength<br>that we're seeing in Europe.<br>
<b>Mark Lynch</b> - Appian Corporation - CFO<br>
And I think from the spend, we will continue to invest heavily in the R&amp;D function as well because that's incredibly important for us, to stay basically<br>creating -- basically improving the simplicity of the platform and making it easier to deploy throughout our customer base.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.<br>
<b>Raimo Lenschow</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director and Analyst<br>
Just going back on the investment level, so we -- on The Street, people obviously modeled a level of losses or profitability for 2018, and you clearly<br>are double-clicking on investment. It seems to me that, I don't know if it was post-IPO, that you see something in the market that kind of triggered<br>that you want to be more aggressive. Can you just talk a little bit about kind of what changed over the last few months that kind of drove this<br>decision to kind of say, look, actually I don't want to wait. I don't want to be that measured. I just -- kind of I need to go now.<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Yes, there definitely were things. I don't want to characterize our response as unmeasured, Raimo. But I will say, there are certainly triggers that we<br>look at to justify an incrementally larger spend footprint. I think the subs revenue being 38% growing year-over-year, that growth rate was certainly<br>a trigger that said, this deserves some additional investment. The NRRR meant a lot to me. That being on the high end of our range and steady at<br>122%. I think the LTV to CAC indicates a lot of strength and that, that warrants a follow-up investment. And I also believe that as a company, we're<br>more able to handle spending more money this year than we were a year ago with the stature or the profile we have coming out of the IPO, with<br>the far greater partner support than we had. And that support is so necessary. If we're going to scale up quickly and staff clients to success, I needed<br>that to be there. We need that to be there. I believe we're in a better position to spend carefully and incrementally than we were a year ago.<br>
<b>Raimo Lenschow</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director and Analyst<br>
And then on that note, like a couple of quarters ago, there was a little bit of a debate. Are you kind of low-code? Are you kind of more than low-code,<br>et cetera? Like, how did you see the market understanding evolving of what you do, how you fit into the world versus -- vis-a-vis other players in<br>the market?<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
That's right. I still prefer an all of the above strategy, which is to say that what we're offering is a little bit divergent from the expectations that any<br>market label carries but that we can fulfill the expectations of many markets. And that we hope we are seen in greater fidelity as we go forward<br>and that a market definition begins to coalesce around exactly what we're offering, which is a great, easy way to build unique software. You don't<br>exactly feel that when you hear about low-code. Low-code gives you the simplicity side but not the power. And you don't feel that in other definitions<br>

either, like case management, BPM, high productivity application platform as a service and a few other tongue-twisters. None of them convey the<br>totality of what Appian is offering which, in short, is a combination between simplicity and speed and power of application. Nobody is really hitting<br>that sweet spot, but I do believe that the message is getting out, and it may be getting out most effectively through examples of Appian's success<br>rather than through redefined market parameters. Suffice it to say, the market is still indistinct in many ways, and we are exceeding the expectations<br>of clients who approach us under any one of those market labels. However, competitively, it's landed us in a very good circumstance. We're seeing<br>growth and competitive success no matter which angle the customer comes to us from.<br>
<b>Raimo Lenschow</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director and Analyst<br>
Okay, perfect. And then last question from me. As you think about the European roll out -- or like if you think about how you expand in Europe,<br>can you talk a little bit how you do that? Like, a lot of software companies historically done, like they start in U.K. and use that as a bridgehead to<br>go into other countries in Europe. Like, what's your approach there?<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Yes, that's right. Well, we have also followed that game plan. Our first and largest office in Europe is in London, and we have branched out from<br>there. However, as we've matured, we've refined the strategy, the doctrine by which we enter new countries. Whereas in the past, it might have<br>been you drop a sales rep in there and hope that a year or 2 from now, they've got a referenceable customer, and then you hope that customer<br>convinces some partners to train resources. And then you have a viable combination of reputation, resources and presence. We don't do that<br>anymore. Our new doctrine says that when you go into a new office, new country, you go in with a minimum viable team, which is to say you need<br>reps; consultants; adequate support, generally from partners; references, publicity; in-language marketing. We place a minimum winning team in<br>our new offices now, and it gets us the basis for good growth.<br>
<b>Mark Lynch</b> - Appian Corporation - CFO<br>
For example, we did that in Spain not too long ago, and that model worked incredibly well and, as you saw, the announcement the other day about<br>the significant expansion with Banco Santander.<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
That was a press release from this week.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.<br>
<b>Matthew Fraser Broome</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - VP<br>
This is actually Matt Broome on for Gregg. I'm just curious to what extent is your planned new spend targeting new business versus expansions at<br>existing deployments?<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Those are both so important to us. I try not to counterpose the 2 against each other. When we bring on new reps, we tend to focus them on new<br>accounts so that they don't get distracted by growing versus seeking. However, both of these components are exceptionally important to us. We<br>have a land-and-expand strategy. And so we mean to get more out of every new customer that we sell. As part of the plan, then, we've got<br>

salespeople dedicated to it. So both of these are so important. And depending on how new we are in a vertical or a region, we might favor one<br>over the other, but they're both so essential. I don't want to trade them.<br>
<b>Matthew Fraser Broome</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - VP<br>
That's fair enough. And I guess, how do you characterize overall industry awareness of low-code today versus sort of 12 months ago?<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
I think that our IPO did something to put low-code on the map, I hope so. I believe that we've got more attention -- I can tell you we have more<br>attention on our website. We get more attention at trade shows. We get far more attention from partners than we did a year ago. So while it's hard<br>for me to quantify how much of that attention is attached to low-code specifically, and how much of it is just accruing according to our demonstrated<br>value proposition or our larger presence, our greater marketing, that I don't know. But I will say we're getting a lot more attention.<br>
<b>Matthew Fraser Broome</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - VP<br>
Okay, great. And then finally, just when you look back on 2017, how are hiring levels relative to plan? That's it for me.<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Hiring levels were fairly true to plan, and that's saying something. In the past, Appian has been reluctant or challenged in its ability to fill hiring<br>plans. I think I might have something to do with it. We tend to be really tough on who we bring on, and I try to be involved in a lot of those cycles.<br>So we got a great recruiting team. We invested in building up our capability, and now, we are delivering a solid pipeline of no-compromise<br>candidates, which is to say we're hitting our hiring targets with no compromise, no dilution to the quality of the firm, the culture of the firm. I'm<br>really impressed. It's a sort of a low-profile victory for us, is the degree of great candidates we've been able to put through the process and hire in<br>2017.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question is from Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs.<br>
<b>Jesse Wade Hulsing</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
I wanted to drill back into the net adds, which is very, very encouraging. Were the deal sizes on lands different versus where they've been prior?<br>And I was also hoping that you could give us some color on maybe trends by vertical. Are you seeing any particular strength in health care or<br>financial services or any other vertical on the net adds side?<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Okay. First of all, with regards to the size of the net adds, not the count of them, now, but the size, like, have we maintained an equal deal size over<br>time with regards to our lands? Yes, we have. In fact, we've maintained full consistency with past trends. And with regards to the count and where<br>it's falling across different industries, I'll say financial services continues to be terrific for us. We highlighted our success in health care, in the 1<br>quarter ago earnings release. And we highlighted our success in pharma in the current release. And I believe those 2 industries have excelled for<br>us. So I'd put those as our top 3. Not that I'm not pleased with others. I think we've got a -- we have a great diversity of clients and industries, but<br>those 3 have stood out.<br>

<b>Jesse Wade Hulsing</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
That's helpful. And I understand the rationale for investing, particularly given the inflection that you're seeing in customer growth. But I'm wondering<br>what's the thought process for free cash flow breakeven timing-wise? Do you have any targets in mind?<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Okay, yes. You want to take it?<br>
<b>Mark Lynch</b> - Appian Corporation - CFO<br>
Yes. As we've been saying over the past, I'd say, 9 months or so, we still expect to basically be breakeven cash flow basis towards the end of 2019,<br>or the end of 2019 going into 2020. So that still has not changed. And in fact, if you look at Q4 this year, we were -- we actually generated -- we're<br>modestly cash flow positive in the quarter. So we're going to keep our eye on that, but right now, we're going to continue to invest. At least in<br>2018, we're bullish about the opportunity we see in front of us, and we're going to do it. But as we've always said, we're going to do it pragmatically.<br>It's kind of against our DNA, but it's something that we're going to do in a deliberate manner.<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
The incremental spend increase that we mentioned today is a 2018 incremental spend increase and is not about, in any way, 2019.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question is from Bhavan Suri with William Blair.<br>
<b>Bhavanmit Singh Suri</b> - William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Partner &amp; Co-Group Head of Technology, Media, and Communications<br>
Let me touch first on a strategic question, then maybe more a tactical one as a follow-up. But strategically, if you think about the product, Matt,<br>you've got sort of Kx. You've got metadata. You sort of built out the suitability to generate at scale. Obviously, you went through the various pieces,<br>code and low-code is a part of it but scale and speed and everything else. But to me, as you think about the roots of BPM that you guys came from,<br>there's also the ability to think about using AI to drive automation as these applications are rolled out, normal stride application improvement and<br>application process improvement. I'd love to sort of think about -- love to get some thoughts from you, not necessarily in the next even 3, 4, 5<br>quarters. But sort of as you guys think about the long term, the next 2 to 3 years, how the product evolves to embed some of that stuff in there to<br>drive that? Is that something you guys are working on? How do you think that rolls out? Is it a value add? Is it something that's just incremental to<br>the product? Just some thoughts on how you guys and the team are thinking about it, especially given some of the roots around analytics you<br>guys have too, would love to understand that.<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Yes, that's a great question. We do have roots in analytics. We love data. We love AI. We've been having a few announcements with regards to AI.<br>You saw something, I think, beginning of last year. We're absolutely thinking about this, working on this. We don't have anything to announce<br>today, but we have announced and surely, we will announce on this topic. I will say, by the way, that I believe that AI belongs a little bit lower in<br>the stack than popular imagination might place it. And I mean that on the technological stack and also on the stack that has a person at the top.<br>So I'm less thinking, say, that AI is going to write your next application and more thinking that AI will provide critical support in interpreting,<br>evaluating, quantifying, recognizing, right? These are things that AI is really well-suited for. Someday, someday, maybe AI will do everything for<br>us. But right now, I believe it's going to master the bottom of the stack first, and we are approaching the AI opportunity that way.<br>

<A name=479></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, APPN.OQ - Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Bhavanmit Singh Suri</b> - William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Partner &amp; Co-Group Head of Technology, Media, and Communications<br>
Got it. Got it. Yes, and I tend to agree with sort of the here's a recommendation as opposed to rewriting things, true. I guess something a little more<br>tactical from my perspective. You've talked about some of these really nice expansions at customers, and it's coupled with sort of partners too. But<br>as you think about it, I'd love to understand how, a little more tactically, a partner gets involved, develops the first application -- or sorry, a customer<br>gets involved, develops the first application and they roll it out. And there's great acceptance and it is much more efficient and it is quick. And your<br>team was involved, and maybe your partner was involved, but obviously, the customer was involved. When they get to the second application<br>they think they can roll out, what percentage is that sort of the customer's people doing it now that they've got comfortable and they're trained?<br>And then by the third or fourth, sort of what is that linearity of sort of the customer owning the idea and owning the process to automate these<br>legacy systems and applications using Appian sort of play out? Do you see what I'm trying to get to?<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
I absolutely do. It's where I'm trying to get to. I'd like to hand off the services to the customer or to a partner, as per the customer's preference, as<br>early as possible in the life cycle, provided that we in no way threaten the success of our value proposition on-site. That's my goal. So we train. We<br>transition. We bring partners on to our original deal team, so that the transition will be easier, and we can move on. We have redirected the services<br>team this year, explicitly in bonuses everywhere from the top-down. We have redirected the team to care more about customer success and net<br>revenue retention than we care about billable hours or service revenue. So we're serious about not treating customers as a cash cow but instead<br>being enablers to their success. That is our goal with services. And we're happy to stand aside as soon as possible in order to be sure that happens.<br>
<b>Bhavanmit Singh Suri</b> - William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Partner &amp; Co-Group Head of Technology, Media, and Communications<br>
And I guess, my really quick follow-up would be, so have you seen that happen? Have you seen customers sort of say, hey, we love the technology,<br>thanks for the tech, but we don't need your folks. We don't need your partner's folks because we got this. So I'm just trying to understand what<br>that time line looks like. Like how long before -- say, a large customer who's expanded a couple of times. Looks like any trends would be helpful.<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Yes, I've seen customers say that before the first application, right? Say, we've got this. I remember customers occasionally saying, if we need you<br>for services, then we don't want you for software, right? So some customers are very bold about this whether because they've got internal confidence<br>or they insist on simplicity. There are reasons why the number of applications that we service is zero, sometimes. Every -- as we go forward in an<br>account, we're doing less and less, percentage-wise, with services. As I said, we're also intending to lose market share, and we are losing market<br>share in the Appian-related services category overall. So our objective is merely to guarantee quality and get out of the way.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question is Richard Davis with Canaccord Genuity.<br>
<b>Richard Hugh Davis</b> - Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD &amp; Analyst<br>
So it sounds like the change in strategy is offensive. And so therefore I have a couple of questions on the competitive set and stuff like that, so kind<br>of 2 parts. One, you mentioned, pharmaco -- I can't pronounce it, there's too many syllables, but the pharmacovigilance, whatever, is that competitive<br>at all to Veeva? And then second, have you seen any change in kind of the competitive bakeoffs that you're running into with regard to particularly,<br>companies like Pegasystems, OutSystems, ServiceNow, any of the other folks? Has there been any evolution on that front?<br>

<A name=480></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, APPN.OQ - Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Okay. With regards to Veeva, I am not aware that we have ever competed against Veeva. And pharmacovigilance does not -- is not an overlap with<br>them. With regards to our competitors, we see the same cast of characters as we are used to seeing, with Pegasystems foremost. We see Pegasystems<br>most of the time, and I believe it is still the case that we see Pegasystems more than twice as often as we see any other competitor.<br>
<b>Mark Lynch</b> - Appian Corporation - CFO<br>
But I think it's important too that from a -- when we go in, it's -- a lot of times, it's Appian or do it themselves. So the first and foremost is do they<br>want to build it themselves. And they realize it's going to be really hard. It's going to take them 3 years, and they don't have all the people to do it.<br>So that's our first incumbent. But when you look at competitive forays, it is definitely Pega, and then after that, it's a smattering of other folks.<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
I'm glad you brought that up. Our first competitor, so to speak, is just alternative value propositions. We don't actually think too much about our<br>competitors, we think about our value proposition. We think about whether we're adding value on site, whether we're accelerating the ability to<br>make new applications, whether those applications are powerful, whether they're secure and usable and easy and walk-up valuable. That's all<br>extremely important to us, and we spend a great deal of time honing the value proposition compared with really almost no time at all thinking<br>about what our competitors are doing or whether we can match them in some way. We know that this is a wide open market. We know that our<br>-- Appian and its competitors offer fundamentally different roots and different value proposition. And therefore, this is not a parity situation nor a<br>feature matching situation, not for the most part. It is instead a pioneering situation in which we, and others in their own ways, attempt to create<br>a meaningful value proposition.<br>
<b>Richard Hugh Davis</b> - Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD &amp; Analyst<br>
Got it. And then just a numbers question. So if you're spending $10 million incremental on various hires and stuff like that, is the logic -- should I,<br>as an outsider, think, well, obviously it won't add a bunch of revenues to '18 because you got to cycle people in. But in '19, I assume that you hope<br>and intend that to be accretive. I mean, do you guys run numbers and go, okay, if we spend $10 million, that will get us $20 million in '19? Or how<br>-- at least as an outsider, and I know you're not guiding for '19, but how should we think about that?<br>
<b>Mark Lynch</b> - Appian Corporation - CFO<br>
We're hoping that our investments bear fruit, obviously. And we don't want to give any guidance or indication of what's going to happen in 2019.<br>But we've said all along, from a subs revenue perspective, we feel comfortable with a 30%-plus growth, which I think everybody on this line would<br>think is a reasonably decent growth for a software company.<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
I would like to -- I mean, that's the perfect answer, of course, we can't guide to '19. But I would like to say that look what happened in Europe, right?<br>We've been investing in Europe for a couple of years. We've talked about our plans, right, to have a bigger footprint and to do a better job saturating<br>the opportunity on the continent. And then, in these results, you see that, that pays off. So I think it's some reinforcement of our confidence that<br>we can invest well.<br>

<A name=481></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, APPN.OQ - Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Terrell Frederick Tillman</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
I wanted to build on Richard's question and ask about the 2020 guidance. No, I'm kidding. Real quick in terms of, I can't help but look at -- and a<br>lot of us analysts wait with bated breath on these metrics that sometimes you guys will tease us and give us some of these metrics. In the case of<br>the net adds, I mean, it really is a big step up. And part of it's definitely explained, Matt, by the partners driving over 30 deals, which is powerful.<br>But just from an expectation standpoint, I know you're not guiding to net adds for '18, but with these partners still in the earlier stages, could we<br>theoretically continue to see tremendous growth in customer acquisition in '18 even before these investments that Richard had asked about, and<br>you talked about, even bear fruit.<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
All right. Well, there's a few reasons why we had as much success as we did in net adds. I think our profile rising had something to do with it, maybe<br>a little. We did very well with partners. So you're spot on about that. Europe produced more net adds than the whole company did a year prior.<br>And then I also think that our message met the market very well this year, which is to say, we were selling something that people wanted to buy.<br>It was digital transformation. It was an easier way to build applications. That was a good message, and so it helped us. All these things helped us.<br>And the simplicity of that message helped us. It was an easier thing for a new customer to digest and approve. I believe a lot of these factors will<br>continue to help us in similar ways. And I believe we're going to have a good year in terms of net customer adds. We don't guide to it, and I don't<br>want to. And I do want to be careful to suggest that -- or I want to be careful not to suggest that I think another tripling is in the works. I think that<br>triple had a lot to do with some fortuitous alignments, and we're certainly not expecting that. But we do believe we're going to get good growth<br>in net customer adds in 2018 because a lot of factors are lined up well for us.<br>
<b>Mark Lynch</b> - Appian Corporation - CFO<br>
And I think it's important for those folks that are listening in, is that from a guidance -- or not a guidance perspective, but from a disclosure perspective,<br>we plan on giving customer net add -- basically customer net adds on an annual basis, not on a quarterly basis.<br>
<b>Terrell Frederick Tillman</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Yes, right. Right. Okay, got it. And Matt, in terms of with some incremental investment because of the excitement and the opportunity into '18,<br>could we see another beachhead or an onslaught in another vertical market? Or are you just going to take the 3 or 4 where you're seeing major<br>traction and just go deeper and broader with those?<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Yes. Well, whenever there's a decision like this at Appian, we always say we want to do fewer things better. That isn't to say that we'll always have<br>the same set of verticals that we've got now. In fact, I'm sure we won't. We don't have a new one to announce today. We feel we've done very well<br>in the investments we've made and the focus that we've shown in key verticals: financial services, pharmaceuticals, health care. So we're going to<br>keep at those. And at such time as we broaden that, we'll announce it then.<br>
<b>Mark Lynch</b> - Appian Corporation - CFO<br>
Yes. But I think also, if you look at the S-1 and all that stuff, we're relatively vertical agnostic. I mean, our platform resonates within any vertical. It's<br>really, what we're trying to do is focus on certain verticals that has certain pain points that our platform meets really well.<br>

<A name=482></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, APPN.OQ - Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Terrell Frederick Tillman</b> - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Got it. And Mark, not to keep you out in the cold here, like it is here in Toronto, where I'm at right now. But a question in terms of: the services was<br>significant upside in the quarter, and you explained it pretty well. But at the same time, you are trying to, and as Matt tried to emphasize, you want<br>to lose significant market share in services, which I guess is a good thing. But I'm thinking about how do we look at services either for the full year<br>or off of the fourth quarter? Just trying to be as accurate as we can in the model with that.<br>
<b>Mark Lynch</b> - Appian Corporation - CFO<br>
Yes, I think -- I mean I think we've said at a high level, and services are kind of lumpy, and they surge at times, as you guys can see you on our<br>historical financials. But what we try to say is that on average, over the long haul, we would expect services to grow about as fast -- about half as<br>fast as our subscription revenue growth, maybe even a little slower than that. But obviously, that didn't bear fruit in Q4, and part of it was the net<br>new customer adds. But I think as the partner ecosystem comes in play, you're going to see more and more of the services ultimately going to<br>them. But we're not going to just see the professional services disappear. You're going to see some growth next year. It just won't be 50% growth<br>kind of thing.<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Yes. I want to say a little bit to this. I totally agree with everything Mark said. Services had a few anomalous surprises here in the last [2] quarters.<br>We don't want that to be anybody's expectation going forward. You see our guidance on services, it's not for growth. I believe services is a very<br>good indicator. When it does pop up like this, it means great things for the business even though we're trying to transition to partners. It means<br>that we got a lot of new logos, and it means that we're getting ready to get some good follow-on sales. Those are the 2 things that I see when I see<br>more services dollars for Appian. It's the key link in a chain between a success in gaining customers and a success in upselling customers. And as<br>such, it means good things in all directions, but we're doing -- we're actively transitioning these to partners. You will see that. We will do that. And<br>it will -- we're not going to be shocking you every time with professional services.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Matt for closing remarks.<br>
<b>Matthew W. Calkins</b> - Appian Corporation - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
All right. I appreciate very much the interest, the questions, the support that you've all shown in Appian. I believe we've got a great year here<br>ramping up, and I'm looking forward to 2018. Thank you for your questions and your time tonight.<br>

Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.<br>

<b>5. </b>(inaudible) program, received prime and breakthrough designations.<br>
<b>a. </b>Patient community is enthusiastic about valrox, notion of a potentially one-and-done treatment option for patient<br>
community who dealt in past with frequent joint bleeds and need to always have access to rescue medications even in<br>face of taking multiple weekly infusions of recombinant factor VIII was inconceivable before gene therapy.<br>
<b>b. </b>Momentum is definitely building in this area of development in hemophilia.<br>

<b>d. </b>Global Phase 3 program continues to enroll as plan.<br>
<b>i. </b>Anticipates completion mid-year.<br>
<b>e. </b>BLA for next potential commercial product pegvaliase was filed last June.<br>
<b>i. </b>Looks forward to PDUFA outcome in late May.<br>
<b>ii. </b>PKU market represents significant opportunity, as Co. has seen with Kuvan.<br>
<b>7. </b>Looking forward to 2018, double-digit growth of revenue should continue with total revenue expected to be $1.47-1.53b.<br>
<b>a. </b>Represents growth of 15-19% vs. 2017 results.<br>
<b>8. </b>Non-GAAP income $74m.<br>
<b>a. </b>In 2018, expects to improve upon these results to range of $100-140m in non-GAAP income.<br>
<b>i. </b>62% improvement from midpoint.<br>
<b>b. </b>In years to come, intends to steadily increase bottom line results, while continuing to invest in pipeline.<br>
<b>II. 2017 COMMERCIAL REVIEW (J.A.)</b><br>
<b>A. Highlights:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Delivered record results of sales.<br><b>2. </b>Total revenues exceeded previous year by 18% and breaking $1.3b mark for the first time.<br>

<b>b. </b>Major uses of cash included growth CapEx for the year of just under $200m, driven by construction of new gene therapy<br>
manufacturing facility.<br>
<b>c. </b>Finished build-out of manufacturing facility in Shanbally to support commercial supply of Vimizim plus some office facilities<br>
in Novato and San Rafael.<br>
<b>6. </b>Investment in inventory increased by $125m, due to new approval of Brineura and increased Vimizim and Kuvan revenues.<br>
<b>B. Long-Term Guidance:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Starting in 2017 and through end of decade, expects revenues from approved products plus pegvaliase to grow 15% per<br>
year and then revenue growth to accelerate above that level with vosoritide and Valrox.<br>
<b>2. </b>With respect to OpEx, guided they will generally grow on absolute dollar basis but at lower rate than revenue growth,<br>
creating incremental operating margin and bottom line expansion through end of decade and acceleration of profit growth<br>after that.<br>
<b>3. </b>2018 guidance is consistent with that plan.<br>
<b>C. 2018 Outlook:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Total revenue $1.47-1.53b.<br>
<b>a. </b>To help analyze this vs. 2017 total revenues, excluding one-time Sarepta upfront payment, 2018 revenue guidance<br>
represents revenue growth of 15-19%.<br>
<b>b. </b>2018 revenue forecast assumes key currencies remain at current exchange rates through the year.<br>
<b>c. </b>Revenue guidance does assume launch of pegvaliase in US in 2H18.<br>
<b>i. </b>Believes Co. can achieve revenues in this guidance range even without pegvaliase.<br>
<b>2. </b>GAAP net loss $115-165m.<br><b>3. </b>Non-GAAP income $100-140m.<br>
<b>a. </b>Improvement at midpoint over 2017 non-GAAP results of 62%.<br>
<b>4. </b>R&amp;D spend $645-685m, driven by vosoritide and Valrox Phase 3 being in full swing in 2018 vs. relatively light clinical spend<br>
year in 2017.<br>
<b>5. </b>SG&amp;A $575-615m, driven by planned launch of pegvaliase, continued launch of Brineura, and continued efforts on growth<br>
of Vimizim and Kuvan.<br>
<b>a. </b>With global infrastructure in place, straight G&amp;A spending is basically unchanged YoverY.<br>
<b>6. </b>SG&amp;A and R&amp;D expense guidance shows increase of 5.0-11.5% vs. 2018 revenue growth of 15-19%.<br><b>7. </b>One area of margin contraction in 2018 is cost of sales, with guidance of 20-21% of revenues.<br>
<b>a. </b>About 200 BP higher than last year's result.<br><b>b. </b>Main drivers of 2018 cost of sales rate increase are related to additional production capacity from Shanbally facility coming<br>
online.<br>
<b>i. </b>Shanbally, Ireland facility approval results in some non-recurring charges being recognized in 2018; increased per unit<br>
production costs at current volumes.<br>
<b>ii. </b>As revenues increased and new products get approved, will more fully utilized that capacity.<br>
<b>iii. </b>If that capacity gets utilized, expects cost of sales line to return to historical levels.<br>
<b>8. </b>Both vosoritide and Valrox could have substantially improved GM, which could drive down long-term cost of sales level<br>
below historical level.<br>
<b>9. </b>CapEx:<br>
<b>a. </b>Expects overall capital investment in 2018 to be similar to 2017 and between $160-180m, primarily in manufacturing and<br>
laboratory facilities.<br>
<b>b. </b>There will be approx. $70-90m investment in additional inventory to support new product launches and revenue growth.<br>
<b>10. </b>Per Co.'s prior guidance, intends to repay $375m principal amount of maturing 2018 borrowings in cash regardless of<br>
whether they mature in money or not.<br>
<b>11. </b>Even with these capital and cash outlays, believes that existing financial resources mean Co. won't need to additional equity<br>

<b>IV. 2017 DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (H.F.)</b><br>
<b>A. Valrox:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>When Co. started program, it was hoping to convert patients from severe to mild hemophilia.<br><b>2. </b>Last year, discussed about Proof of Concept results observed in 2016 and which Co. was going well beyond achieving milder<br>
stage of hemophilia.<br>
<b>3. </b>Augmented plans with addition of 4e13 vg/kg dose.<br>
<b>a. </b>Demonstrated positive efficacy and safety data on Phase 1/2 program led to launch of Phase 3 GENEr8-1 and GENEr8-2<br>
studies.<br>
<b>i. </b>Both of which are open for enrollment.<br>
<b>4. </b>At most recent data update at ASH last Dec., excited to update results after treatment of patients with 6e13 vg/kg dose.<br>
<b>a. </b>Most patients have achieved and maintained factor VIII levels within normal range in severe hemophilia A.<br><b>b. </b>Medium annualized bleeding rates and factor use continued to be zero for both metrics at that time point.<br>
<b>c. </b>Shared up to one year results with 4e13 vg/kg dose for three patients with longest follow-up with factor VIII levels in or<br>
near normal range.<br>
<b>d. </b>4e13 vg/kg dose results at that time point demonstrated sustained factor VIII levels approaching or within lower-end of<br>
normal range for most patients.<br>
<b>e. </b>4e13 vg/kg subjects had median annualized bleeding rates and factor use of zero as of that time point.<br>
<b>5. </b>Concurrent with ASH, New England Journal of Medicine published preliminary results of ongoing Phase 1/2 study of valrox.<br>
<b>a. </b>Accompanying editorial titled A Cure for Hemophilia within Reach highlighted tremendous need for better therapy for<br>
patients because of residual risk of bleeding, high cost of prophylactic therapy and demanding nature of interment and<br>factor replacement.<br>
<b>b. </b>Established important roadmap to enable access to ever-larger circle of hemophilia patients, possibly including treatment<br>
at earlier ages, patients with previous liver disease or immunity to transferring capsid and even [potentially in] patients<br>with inhibitors.<br>
<b>6. </b>Immediate consequence, next steps of program are to continue enrollment in Phase 3 studies and provide update on Phase<br>
1/2 study around mid-year.<br>
<b>a. </b>Does not think patient interest will in anyway limit enrollment in two studies; 6e13 does by year-end and 4e13 dose shortly<br>
thereafter.<br>
<b>B. Gene Therapy Facilities:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Completely build out.<br><b>2. </b>Expects commercial scale material ready for use in pivotal study at April-end.<br>
<b>a. </b>Has capacity to supply 2,000-3,000 6e13 vg/kg patients annually.<br><b>b. </b>Believes this capability further increases Co.'s lead in the field vs. any other co. developing gene therapy product for severe<br>
hemophilia A.<br>
<b>C. Vosoritide for Children with Achondroplasia:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>At R&amp;D Day last Oct., showed durable growth velocity sustained through 30 months of treatment using 15 microgram per<br>
kilo dose.<br>
<b>a. </b>Shared data supporting expectations for continued growth based on lead indicators for potential improvement in other<br>
complications from conditions like spinal cord compression, foramen magnum compression, sleep apnea, disproportionality<br>and daily activities, and many of Co. take for granted.<br>
<b>2. </b>Specifically over 30-month observation period, patients experienced mean absolute growth increase of approx. 4 centimeters<br>
over what their baseline growth velocity would have predicted.<br>
<b>3. </b>Treatment with vosoritide demonstrated continued improvement over time and proportionality as measured by a ratio of<br>
upper and lower body measurements or U/L ratio as part of 30-month update.<br>
<b>4. </b>Feeder study, which establishes baseline growth rate prior to treatment, does not fully enroll, reflecting high degree of<br>
interest in patient community internationally and in US particularly.<br>

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs.<br>
<b>Salveen Jaswal Richter</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - VP<br>
So I just wanted to clarify your 2018 revenue guidance. You mentioned you can achieve guidance or you'll be in the range without<br>pegvaliase revenue, but just wondering what you've attributed to pegvaliase in '18. And then secondly, with regard to the pipeline,<br>can you just comment on how enrollment is progressing in the valrox pivotal trials?<br>
<b>Daniel K. Spiegelman</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, this is Dan. So I'll take the honor of not answering your question. So consistent with our prior practice, we don't give first year<br>revenue guidance specific to newly launched products. And we're going to continue that practice in 2018. And enrollment?<br>

<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Similar context. As I said in my prepared remarks, the patient interest is phenomenal in this and we, more or less, essentially identified<br>an abundant -- a sufficiently abundant pool of patients to enroll. The gating factor is site activation, contracts, IRBs, et cetera, that's<br>progressing smoothly as predicted and our projection is that we'll complete enrollment in the first of the 2 studies by the end of the<br>year with the second study coming in after that. So although it's early, we're quite pleased with the track record of enrollment and<br>patient identification.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.<br>
<b>Cory William Kasimov</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Biotechnology Analyst<br>
A pipeline and a commercial one for me. So in the pipeline one, Hank, I wanted to ask about BMN 250 and how much follow-up you<br>think you need there before potentially moving to the pivotal program. Is that the 1-year DQ data you've just mentioned? And then<br>I guess on that front, what do you hope to see on that side to move forward? Is stabilization of DQ enough or you need improvement,<br>too? And then, I have a follow-up for commercial.<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
It's a little early to talk about the pivot to a subsequent study. I think what I -- the context I'd put on things now is that just a reminder<br>that Brineura got approved in the United States on the basis of 96-week data and in Europe on the basis of 72-week data. And finally,<br>it was triggered actually on the basis of 48-week data, big credit goes to the health authorities for being able to include more updated<br>data in the package inserts on the basis of relatively rapid real-time review. So in the context of Brineura, 48 weeks by itself was<br>enough. I -- we don't know about the efficacy of the full cohort of patients at 48 weeks, so that's why it's premature to speculate. But<br>what I'd say is, is that based on Brineura, we have made substantial improvements in the 250 programs. Specifically, we're using the<br>same exact tool to measure outcome in a natural history context as in the treatment context. We're measuring those development<br>quotient improvements in the same patients, not different patients. Those were -- that was a big part of the Brineura review and<br>we've eliminated that as a concern for the 250 application. In addition, unlike Brineura, in the case of 250, there's a very good biomarker<br>for biological activity of the product. And finally, unlike with Brineura where there were no systemic manifestations of the disease<br>to follow, we've already demonstrated normalization of liver size, which I'll remind you, has been a basis of approval for other enzyme<br>replacement therapies. So we're cautiously optimistic about the progress we've made with 250. I think that we're ahead of where<br>we were at a similar time in the case of Brineura and as to kind of what magnitude of improvement would trigger either another<br>study or an application, I think it's a matter of stay tuned.<br>
<b>Cory William Kasimov</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Biotechnology Analyst<br>
Okay, that's helpful. And then on the commercial front, assuming that pegvaliase is, indeed, approved in May, I can appreciate the<br>slow and steady initial launch curve, but how should we be thinking about some of the headwinds and tailwinds for this product?<br>What do you see as the biggest needle movers there that we should be thinking about?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
Yes, so Cory, I think the first thing I would say is the picture is simplified by the fact that we're only anticipating launching in the<br>United States next year. We have over 200 clinical trial patients, a majority of which we would expect to be able to transition to<br>commercial during the course of the year, assuming an approval date on or around our PDUFA. So that's a tailwind. For na�ve to<br>

treatment patients, we have to get through the induction and titration phase. That would be something like a 12- to 24-week period<br>on average, but also noting that some patients have taken longer than 24 weeks to reach a maintenance phase. During that period<br>of time, patients will be taking a variety of doses. So we've got 3 prefilled syringe SKUs, we would anticipate a 2.5-microgram, a<br>10-microgram and a 20-microgram dose. And so depending on the dosing schedule, there would be fractional revenues during the<br>induction titration phase, starting out at 1 syringe per week early in the induction and titration phase. So only fractional revenue<br>during induction and titration. And that would eat up the majority of the calendar year of 2018 for na�ve to treatment patients. So<br>if you consider that to be a bit of a headwind. In terms of new patient enrollment, 35 of the 125 PKU clinics in the United States have<br>experience using pegvaliase through the clinical trial program. So that gives us a good base of experience to start off from. And we<br>know that those investigators are interested in trialing new patients when pegvaliase is approved. We also know that they've guided<br>that they would start patients in relatively small batches. Think several -- or several-ish. Work them up through the initial induction<br>and titration phase to something approaching maintenance dosing and then starting the next batch of patients and so on. So that<br>will be kind of a measured pace of new patient introduction of the pegvaliase. And then for the about 90 PKU clinics in the United<br>States that don't have experience through the clinical trial program, we have the usual education process to get through before we<br>would anticipate they would trial patients. We would anticipate and, in fact, guide those clinics to start with several-ish patients, be<br>very deliberate about having good experiences, good initial experiences with pegvaliase and then starting additional patients. So<br>it will be a measured start throughout 2018.<br>
<b>Jean-Jacques Bienaim�</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Jeff, you might want to add that the majority -- vast majority of the 200 patients that are currently on therapy, we will -- they will not<br>need titration. They can go into full commercial use in the second half of this year.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.<br>
<b>Christopher Joseph Raymond</b> - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst<br>
I've got actually 2 questions on pegvaliase, if that's okay. Just first, I'm curious on the decision to wait on starting a pediatric program<br>until there's an approval in adults. I think you guys have said that for a while. Can you maybe clarify, is this driven by FDA's direction<br>or is this your decision? And I guess, the reason I'm asking is it's kind of striking with today's announcement that you're starting an<br>infant study for visoritide, sort of why not apply maybe the same logic to pegvaliase? And then maybe on the commercial side, I was<br>struck by your comments that revenue for titration patients would be fractional. I thought I heard you guys say earlier that you would<br>not be pricing this on a per milligram basis and rather by SKUs. Can you maybe give a little bit more color? Should we think about<br>it in terms of the amount of drug? Or is there some other measure?<br>
<b>Jean-Jacques Bienaim�</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Hank, you want to go pegvaliase?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Sure, thanks, Chris. The considerations with pegvaliase has all along been -- it's a foreign protein that's PEGylated within an elicited<br>immune response. We really wanted to build a good safety database before going into children. And that is an especially important<br>consideration in the context in which there is an alternative form of therapy for children, namely medical and nutritional therapy.<br>And that's different -- that's one aspect that's different from our other indications and another -- and therefore, sort of the ongoing<br>

<A name=494></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, BMRN - Q4 2017 Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc Earnings Call<br>
accrual of damage is blunted in PKU as compared with our other enzyme replacement therapy business. So I think those things,<br>those 2 things combined, the nature of the product and wanting to build a really strong safety database as well as the availability<br>of medical and nutritional, the compliance with medical and nutritional therapy, which is higher in children than it is in adults,<br>suggests to us to take a more measured approach with these children. Now upon regulatory action, clearly, that can be revisited.<br>
And Chris, on the subject of why the fractional revenue during the induction and titration phase. Thinking about pegvaliase patients<br>in a maintenance setting where they would likely be receiving either 20-milligram or 40-milligram per day maintenance dosing, we<br>would be pricing principally on expectations of how to price for maintenance dosing. I mentioned earlier that we're anticipating<br>that we would have 3 different prefilled syringe SKUs, 2.5-milligram syringe, 10-milligram syringe and 20-milligram syringe. In the<br>United States, the most likely method of pricing pegvaliase would be either pricing on a per milligram basis or pricing on a per<br>syringe basis. In the maintenance space dose setting, imagine a 20-milligram per day patient receiving 1 20-milligram syringe per<br>day. In an induction and titration phase, same patient would be starting out at 1 2.5-milligram syringe, once a week, and the frequency<br>of that syringe use increasing, getting to the point of switching to a 10-milligram syringe and then all the way up to a daily dose of<br>20-milligram in this case. So whether we price on a per syringe basis or a per milligram basis, during the induction and titration<br>phase, the patients would be getting a fractional price essentially during that period. And that fractional piece would be shifting<br>from very low in the range initially to higher in the range as they get further through the induction of the titration process.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
This is [Crip] on for Robyn. I too had actually a couple of pegvaliase questions. One question is about training the centers that did<br>not participate in the clinical trials. Do you have a plan in place for how you expect to train them? And can you talk about maybe a<br>time line for when you expect these centers to go online? And just to clarify, you said that they will -- the centers that are already<br>online will treat several [LISH] patients in the beginning. So do you expect them to take on these patients and then take them through<br>the induction titration period before they start maintenance trial and then only take on new patients?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Maybe I'll start and Jeff can chime in. As far as the broadening from the 35 to 125, clearly, the 35 centers who have a lot of hands-on<br>experience with pegvaliase have learned a lot. And we've captured a lot of that learning and we intend to apply that learning to the<br>other 90 that we need to bring online. And yes, we have quite detailed plans, but in the current moment, what I want to say about<br>that is, we can't really speak about what those detailed plans are until the label for the product is final. So I think the context I'll leave<br>you with, in the moment is, you better believe, we've got seriously detailed plans for how to extend the learnings from the 35 to the<br>125. And as to how the commercial team is going to operationalize and build on that, maybe Jeff wants to take over.<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
Yes. I think, thank you, Hank. A couple of the things that I think will be impactful in year 1 for the na�ve to experience clinics are, one,<br>what we would anticipate is a kind of a guidelines document to be published shortly after pegvaliase approval. We'll receive it at<br>the end of May. That would be one piece. And that the second piece would be to find kind of peer-to-peer opportunities to leverage<br>the experience of the clinical trial investigators to share with their non-experienced peers some tips and guidance on working<br>through their initial patients. In terms of the induction and titration phase, the maintenance and the notion of starting several<br>patients, several [LISH] patients, getting them through the induction-titration phase before starting additional patients, what we've<br>heard the clinical trial investigators say is that, it's exactly the 12- to 24-week period that is normal for induction and titration, that<br>

is the most intensive period for them to be managing dose adjustments, potential adverse events, that sort of thing. Once they get<br>through those, the dose adjustments and period where adverse events are most likely to occur, then the workload on those patients<br>goes down significantly. And it's exactly at that point that we would anticipate clinics would be receptive to starting additional<br>patients into the induction and titration phase again.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Great. And if I can sneak in one more question. Have you seen any interest from patients currently on Kuvan -- adult patients -- in<br>pegvaliase?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
We have not entirely polled existing patients for their interest in pegvaliase. You'll recall that we can't go out and speak promotionally<br>about pegvaliase until it's approved. So I would anticipate there would be some interest, but I can't speak more specifically to that.<br>

Your next question comes from the line of Philip Nadeau from Cowen and Company.<br>
<b>Philip M. Nadeau</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
One also on pegvaliase and one on BMN 250. The pegvaliase comments in your prepared remarks, you mentioned cautious optimism<br>and you specifically mentioned the FDA getting comfortable with immune reactions. It seemed like your comments are a bit more<br>cautious today than maybe what we've heard in the past. I'm just curious what was the reason for that? Is that coming from your<br>interactions with the FDA or are you simply erring on the side of conservatism?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
The latter. Just -- we're 3 months away from a PDUFA date and it isn't over until it's over. But I think it's worth providing a little bit<br>more color on kind of the review process. The tone of interaction is really positive. The (inaudible) review divisional report closely<br>with a lot -- we had a patient-oriented drug development meeting that they requested, where they got a chance to hear from patients<br>for real, on their own, in terms of what the benefit of fee lowering is, what's the disadvantages of current therapy -- benefit and<br>nutritional therapy are, that agency had an opportunity to dig in, in detail about what are the adverse experiences like? What is<br>management of the adverse experiences like? What are you looking for patients in the long haul? And I think that interaction was<br>very positive and people came away enthusiastic. As you know, from public disclosures of the FDA process, the FDA undertakes<br>many activities in parallel during the late stages in review, which include consideration of post-approval requirements, risk management<br>planning, labeling, process control validation, specification setting. All of these activities are on track, proceeding quite nicely. So<br>really, no change from where we've been and the message is that process is not final until the process is final.<br>
<b>Philip M. Nadeau</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
Got it. That's very helpful. And then second question on BMN 250. At the R&amp;D Day that you held last year, I think Dr. Cleary presented<br>a natural history data on about 20 patients. I'm curious. Is that -- was that the full natural history database that you have access to<br>or is it larger? It seems like that the robust natural history data that you had was important to getting Brineura approved. So I'm<br>curious. How robust is the package that you have in MPS IIIB?<br>

<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Well, as I -- the package is going to be substantially more robust. And the reasons for that are -- and if you're -- if you go back to the<br>Brineura review, we were talking about where is the FDA's focus? And we had said comparability of endpoints and comparability of<br>patients. And that was driven by the fact that the patients in the control setting were different patients than the patients in the<br>treatment setting. And those control patients were assessed using a set of tools that were developed by an academic, whereas the<br>tools that we used were more drug industry appropriate tools -- similar conceptually, but not literally the same. In contrast, we are<br>generating a roughly comparably-sized natural history data set, but in this case with 250, we're using the same tools for natural<br>history as for treatment. And now the tools will be -- the evaluations will be in the same patients before treatment and after treatment.<br>So we think that the actual natural history database that we're building, and again, it depends on the magnitude of treatment benefit,<br>will be actually quite robust for interpretation of treatment benefit signals.<br>

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank.<br>
<b>Carlos Efrain Solorzano-Say</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Associate<br>
This is Carlos in for Andrew. Following up on BMN 250. Some of the early data has begun to emerge for gene therapy in some of<br>these enzyme replacement therapies. So how would you think about the competitive landscape going forward? And how can you<br>position your current portfolio as well as for position to R&amp;D franchise to compete in this direction?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Yes, so, I mean, it's worth taking a little bit of a step back in terms of competition. You can probably (inaudible) in general, it's obviously<br>been relatively fertile area for drug development. However, the MPS III family of disorders has been a little bit more challenging<br>because the disease is principally a brain disease or one of the most important (inaudible) are in the CNS. And given the blood-brain<br>barrier, it's been a difficult nut to crack. As you know, companies have tried sort of a subtler approaches like lumbar intrathecal<br>delivery of relatively low doses and, unfortunately, Shire abandoned a program in IIIa with that approach after having gone on a<br>clinical hold for device-related complications. Also, as you know, Synageva, then Alexion had a program of IV delivery and had initially<br>demonstrated some potential evidence of biological activity in the central nervous system after intravenous delivery. But unfortunately,<br>at the most recent world conference, those effects just didn't appear to hold up or be real. And so I think the take-home messages<br>there are: blood-brain barrier challenges are significant and not easily navigated. Now we come to more recent undertakings and<br>another company is taking an intravenous delivery approach using gene therapy to address the blood-brain barrier, have some<br>initial signals of activity and reduction in CSF GAGs. We have published that you really need to correct to normal the accumulation<br>of the pathological species of GAGs. And it remains to be seen whether that can be achieved from the blood [side] of the blood-brain<br>barrier. Our strategy has been the disease, the central nervous system disease, we can make a protein to deliver it directly into the<br>central nervous system, right into the -- -- where the action is in the brain. And that approach has actually proved successful already.<br>So we like our chances. We're aware of the competition. We think there are some big challenges to the competitors, but time will<br>tell.<br>

<b>Carlos Efrain Solorzano-Say</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Associate<br>
Okay. And if I may, just a follow-up on the pipeline on the BMN 290 program. At the R&amp;D Day, you guys discussed how BMN 290 is<br>selective for HDAC-3 over 1 and 2, if we understood the data correctly. And how this could overcome some of the side effects that<br>have been seen with other class 1 HDAC inhibitors. So my question would be where is HDAC expressed in the body and, specifically,<br>in the brain? And what side effects might you expect with BMN 290?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Well, histone deacetylases are used commonly throughout every cell of the body and you're right to point out that there are different<br>classes of -- different isoforms of HDACs. From our preclinical studies, it appears that mild suppression appears to be the most relevant<br>dose limiting toxicity. But we are -- or because of the design of BMN 290, we were able to achieve tissue concentrations of BMN 290,<br>which are inducing frataxin upregulation to a substantial degree and at levels which are lower than the doses that cause mild<br>suppression. Now obviously, that's all preclinical work and the essential clinical question will be whether we can establish a positive<br>therapeutic index, that is to say, frataxin upregulation without accompanying mild suppression. We're cautiously optimistic based<br>on our preclinical data that we can do that, but human clinical experiments will be required to demonstrate that. Now one of the<br>other important points to make here is that because the upregulation of frataxin is specific to the disease allele, this can only be<br>done in diseased patients. And the initial target population of our investigations will be patients. So we'll get an answer very quickly.<br>

<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
I think the key gating factor is going to be an evaluation of the effectiveness there from the first cohort of patients that have been<br>treated for a year, which I said probably won't be until about 2020. So stay tuned for further updates there. But just to remind you,<br>we're going to complete enrollment in the natural history cohort in the first quarter of '18.

They'll roll over onto a treatment starting in the first quarter -- the end of the enrollment -- in the treated patients will<br>be in the first quarter of '19.

Of the 40 or more patients on commercial therapy at the end of 2017, many of those were located in approximately 6 ex-U. S.<br>commercial markets: 2 in Latin America; 4 in Europe. And the reimbursement for those patients is on a named patient or named<br>patient-like basis, while we navigate the full reimbursement and price approval process that we have to get through in most markets.<br>The commercial patients in Europe would be coming from each of Germany, France, Italy and the U.K. And in each of those markets,<br>you know there's varied prescribed set of activities that sponsors need to get through to attain reimbursement approvals and a price<br>level. We are in the midst of navigating that system right now and we anticipate getting through that process in those key markets<br>and other markets during the course of 2018. And we think that having navigated that system and attaining full price and<br>reimbursement status in certain markets will allow patients easier access to commercial Brineura therapy relative to the named<br>patient or named patient like approvals that have been attained so far.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Laura Chico from Raymond James.<br>
<b>Hamzah Qudsi</b><br>
This is Hamzah on for Laura Chico. One on pricing strategy and gene therapy. As you're thinking about various gene therapy pricing<br>strategies, are there certain payment models that make more sense than others within the hemophilia space?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
J.J. did you want to think that one?<br>
<b>Jean-Jacques Bienaim�</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Jeff, why don't you go take it.<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
Yes. So payment models are a key variable for gene therapies. We're seeing how that's playing out already with the initial approvals<br>in the U.S. and Europe of initial products. In the United States, some of the models that have been discussed, which might include<br>payment over time, payment for positive results, something like a rebate for patients that don't respond adequately, those models<br>are going to be challenging to implement unless they're -- until the problem of how to account for government price calculations<br>is solved for. There may be solutions for that, but that's a barrier to implementing those kinds of programs in the United States. And<br>outside of the United States, in single-payer like models, those kind of reimbursement models are probably easier to navigate and<br>impossible to implement. And from BioMarin's perspective, I think, our principal interest in pricing reimbursement model is to be<br>able to capture as much value as possible as valrox may provide: number one on a clinical value basis; number two, on a quality of<br>life value basis; and number three, in terms of a cost process to what is a very expensive life-long treatment regimen today. So we<br>want to capture as much value as possible across all 3 of those dimensions, and we are open to different reimbursement models<br>that will allow us to capture that value.<br>

I have 2. First on valrox and vosoritide, 2 products which you've spoken excitedly about or enthusiastically about in the past. I'm just<br>curious given the uniqueness of those products and the market place, what type of investments are going to be required. If you<br>could speak to sort of the commercial investments, whether there are structural changes that might be required or from a<br>manufacturing standpoint. And the second question was just on business development. You're clearly at a sort of a period of stable<br>growth with visibility into high-growth associated with both of these products. How does that influence your BD decisions and the<br>type of assets and opportunities you might pursue?<br>
<b>Daniel K. Spiegelman</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
This is Dan. Maybe I'll take a stab at the cost structure question and then maybe J.J. you want to do the BD question. Cost structure-wise,<br>frankly, neither vosoritide nor valrox would be materially different than what we've dealt with in the past. As you know, from a<br>manufacturing standpoint, actually the initial commercial scaling manufacturing plant is done. We've talked about being able to<br>handle 2,000 to 3,000 patients a year out of that facility. There are things we could potentially do to even expand that and for<br>additional demand we can to construct capacity either here or elsewhere. Commercial structures would be -- and resources, would<br>be similar to what we've utilized in the past. It would be a different call point and a different sales force, but all the infrastructure is<br>in place and the same for vosoritide. So nothing dramatically or materially different that but we're ready and lined up for. J.J. do you<br>want to take business development?<br>
<b>Jean-Jacques Bienaim�</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Yes, I mean, on the business development front, as you know, we always, on an ongoing basis, analyze potential opportunities. I<br>would say considering the very significant pipeline that we have and the fact that it's likely we will add new projects, we're probably<br>going to announce 1 or 2 new projects before the end of the year, which would be pretty significant projects. I would say our appetite<br>for large transformational deal is relatively low at this time -- that could change -- but however, we are always interested in earlier<br>stage opportunities that would be strategically coherent with our overall strategy of continuing to develop first-in-class or best-in-class<br>products for rare genetic disorders. I mean, obviously, because of the size of the company now, we are achieving $1.5 billion of<br>revenues this year, I would say, unlikely we will move much or continue to -- or develop products for ultra or ultra-orphan or very,<br>very small patient population. But we, at this time, are planning to stick within the orphan space. In the orphan space, there are<br>plenty of opportunities and it will be a combination of large molecules, peptides, small molecules and of course, gene therapy. So<br>that's kind of where we stand today.<br>
<b>Mayur Amrat Somaiya</b> - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Analyst<br>
And J.J. just based on your comments regarding the additional programs you plan to unveil, what is the trigger for that? Can you<br>speak to where, I guess, what therapeutic areas they are likely to address or target or the mortality?<br>
<b>Jean-Jacques Bienaim�</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
I think we have -- I mean, I don't want to say too much, but one of them, I think, we've said at the last Analyst's Day that we are doing<br>some [clinical work], [technical] work on gene therapy for PKU. I mean, that could be one of them. But there is another, at least one<br>other potential project that we probably will feel comfortable to announce before the end of the year. So what's the trigger for us<br>is that when we have done all the work and all the preclinical analysis that makes us comfortable that we are willing to move towards<br>pre-IND activities and move towards initiating earlier clinical trials. So we're getting to a point, it's likely that it will happen for 1 or<br>2 of them between now and end of the year, though I mean, they would not be 2018 and '19, but likely mid-2019 or early '20. So<br>stay tuned on that.<br>

Your next question comes from the line of Jing He from Gabelli.<br>
<b>Jing He</b> - G. Research, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
First on 250. I'm just wondering, the trend in brain volume and ventricular volume are less obvious than they were [size] decrease<br>and stabilizing cognitive function. So I guess, how important are these measures clinically? And also, do you think 300 mg is enough?<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Well, let me start with the second part. 300 milligrams is totally normalized CSF GAG. So I suppose you could ask the question of<br>whether 300 milligrams might be a little too much. But we don't want to make the mistake that others have made by under-dosing<br>and, therefore, giving too little efficacy. And then as far as other surrogate parameters reading on main efficacy parameters, the<br>more important of the parameters, clearly, are the clinical efficacy parameters. We saw, in the case of Brineura, for example, quite<br>dramatic effects on stabilization of loss of [ambulation] and progression of loss of ambulation, for example. And maybe a little less<br>dramatic effects on CSF brain volume. So the good news is that the clinical outcome variables were the important ones. They carry<br>the day and that's what we're hoping to observe in our 250 program when the cohort is fully mature.<br>
<b>Jing He</b> - G. Research, LLC - Research Analyst<br>
Also, could you help us understand your Brineura guidance? What would it take to achieve your low end versus high end of your<br>2018 guidance? Is the driver mainly diagnosis in the U.S. or launching ex-U. S. countries?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
It's really a combination of those variables. We have approval in the United States and across the EU now. So we have regulatory<br>access to a number of markets. We're pursuing additional registrations at this time and then inside of those markets, as I've noted<br>outside of the United States, we're navigating price and reimbursement systems and we're also pursuing early identification of<br>treatment.

Couple of follow-ups on pricing and reimbursement. The first is, as you alluded to earlier, one key aspect of the value in capture for<br>gene therapy would be potential for a longer term multi-year value-based pricing. You're arguably further ahead when it comes to<br>bringing a gene therapy to market for a relatively large indication. What's your level of optimism with respect to being able to achieve<br>some of these more creative pricing structures in the U.S? And what is the path to get there from where we are today?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
Yes. So as I noted earlier, I think that we -- in general, and outside of the United States, we're highly interested and motivated to<br>pursue creative strategies that allows us to capture the value that's provided by valrox. And value is typically thought of on the basis<br>of cost offsets, but there's so much more potentially value that this program offers in terms of quality of life and better clinical<br>outcomes. So we want to capture value across all 3 of those dimensions. And you're absolutely right. Pricing over time, based on<br>durability of effect, for example, could be an excellent vehicle for allowing us to do that. In the United States, there are some practical<br>implications to Medicaid pricing reports that manufacturers must do and that needs to be solved for before some of these more<br>creative programs can be implemented in the United States. A potential solution would be CMS approving so-called demonstration<br>projects or programs that would be submitted by a sponsor like a BioMarin. That could potentially happen. There could be legislative<br>fixes for this on the logic that the original Medicaid legislation that put all these pricing calculations in play in the first place was<br>based on a healthcare system that (inaudible) since 30 years ago, but has been overtaken by innovative advancements like gene<br>therapy today. So I think we're cautiously optimistic, but there needs to be some things that happen to allow us to solve for that and<br>they probably won't happen overnight.<br>
<b>Vincent Chen</b> - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division - VP<br>
And how about the portability issue with folks moving between plans? It sounds like that's something that would take legislative<br>change. What's the path forward there?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
I can tell you some of the feedback that we have gotten from payers on that subject. So subject to the ability to control for free-rider<br>problem, free-rider problem being, for example, (inaudible) for major payers cover for valrox or another gene therapy and one<br>doesn't, creating a free-rider problem. The initial view of the insurers that I've heard is that they would expect the flux in the patients<br>to be relatively the same of flux out of patients. And so the portability problem is not a primary problem for them. It's something<br>that they're interested in and they're thinking about. But it's not their primary barrier to wanting to proceed with payment over time<br>model -- or sorry, a pay upfront model.<br>

I wanted to get your perspective on the recent article from [Dr. Weston's] lab with concerns surrounding<br>the safety of high-dose AAV vector specifically, whether this is sort of unique to the AAV9 that you've used in this study or perhaps<br>you need to do the pigs and monkeys again that you've used in this preclinical study. And then one for Jeff again. On pegvaliase<br>long term, is there something we should be thinking about growing in the market here in the U.S. sort of beyond the 7% year-over-year<br>growth that we saw for Kuvan over the last year? Or should we be anticipating that growth is really going to come from transferring<br>Kuvan patients to pegvaliase and the pricing premium there that you have mentioned.<br>
<b>Henry J. Fuchs</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - President of Worldwide Research &amp; Development<br>
Yes. So as hard as it is to compare across clinical trials in humans of similar agents, it's -- I would say impossible to compare across<br>different vectors, capsids and species. But for some muscular atrophy, there may be some relevance of the findings, I don't know,<br>not an area that we're in. In our area, we have human clinical data on the safety of the doses that we're using. And I think the human<br>safety data are the important consideration for our product.<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
Relative to your question about pegvaliase potential over time. In the United States, there's approximately 4,000 adult PKU patients<br>that are being treated in clinics today, 1/3 of which are presently on Kuvan. At launch, our focus will be the 2/3 of adult PKU patients<br>that are not presently on Kuvan. So we will be focusing very hard on getting incremental access to a bigger portion of the PKU<br>market, and we think that, that would be delivering more than incremental revenue, PKU revenue in total. Beyond launch, we have<br>a motivation to help Kuvan adult patients that are not adequately controlled on Kuvan or not as well as controlled as they would<br>like to be to trial pegvaliase on the logic that we will likely face limitations in our Kuvan exclusivity in a couple of years.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Gena Wang from Barclays.<br>
<b>Gena Wang</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
I would just ask 2 quick questions. So 1, just wanted to confirm with you that 2018 revenue guidance of $1.47 billion to $1.53 billion<br>did not include any pegvaliase assumptions?<br>
<b>Daniel K. Spiegelman</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
No. I think we tried to express it. It does include our assumptions about pegvaliase, but what we said is we think we can still be within<br>the range, obviously lower, but within the range without pegvaliase. So peg's in there.<br>

<b>Gena Wang</b> - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Okay. Sounds good. And then another question is regarding the valrox for hemophilia A. So for the Phase III trial, will patient only<br>receive the new GMP product?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
So to remind you, the trial was started with material made by a contractor using the IIB commercialized process. The bulk of the trial<br>will include patients who are treated using that same IIB commercialized process, but manufactured in our Novato facility at the IIB<br>commercialized scale of manufacture. We believe that sufficient comparability of the data from the contractor to the BioMarin facility<br>at scale will enable us to pool the patients from smaller first part of the study to the larger second part of the study. If that turns out<br>not to be the case, we can simply expand the size of the larger portion of the trial for pivotal purposes.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chan.<br>
<b>Vincent Chen</b> - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division - VP<br>
One quick question on pegvaliase. As you look towards launch and speak to payers, what are you hearing with the likely coverage<br>guidelines for pegvaliase and how this could potentially vary by pricing. From what you've heard, are there some payers that might<br>require patient to potentially fail (inaudible) or Kuvan if pegvaliase is indeed more costly?<br>
<b>Jeffrey Robert Ajer</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer<br>
Yes. So we have conducted payer research not surprisingly, in the run-up to our PDUFA date and we've gotten a mix of feedback<br>from payers. Generally speaking, I would say that the payers are comfortable with the notion of lowering phenylalanine levels as an<br>adequate measure of managing PKU. So that's very good for pegvaliase. And payers are very comfortable, obviously, with their<br>reimbursement of Kuvan. So that sets a good baseline also going into the potential approval of a next-generation therapy. Beyond<br>that, in terms of coverage policies, we've gotten a variety of feedback, but nothing that would be suggestive of kind of hard and<br>strict policies across-the-board of step therapy or failures on Kuvan or that sort of thing. It's possible, but we could see some of that<br>creep in initial coverage policies, however.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
There are no further questions at this time.<br>
<b>Traci McCarty</b><br>
Okay. We'd like to turn over to J.J. to make his final comments and then we'll say goodbye for the day. Thank you.<br>
<b>Jean-Jacques Bienaim�</b> - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Thank you. So thank you, operator. Thank you, Traci. So in summary, 2017 was a defining year for BioMarin as we firmly established<br>our leadership position among rare disease companies. Not only did our development pipeline progress across every program, our<br>Commercial business to a record revenues to over $1.3 billion.<br>

In 2018, we expect topline revenue growth of 15% to 19% per our full year revenue guidance of between $1.47 billion to $1.53 billion.<br>In 2018, in next stage development, we'll see continued enrollment in valrox and vosoritide paving the way for anticipated data<br>results in 2019.<br>
In late May, at the scheduled PDUFA, we hope to receive the U.S. pegvaliase approval. We are all well-equipped the execute a<br>successful launch and given the 10 years of direct experience working with the PKU community, either directly with Kuvan patients<br>and care providers or those who have participated in our pegvaliase clinical trials. From the research side of the business, our team<br>is working diligently to bring forth our next R&amp;D candidates, which could be announced later this year.<br>
The confidence of execution across the commercial, development, research and manufacturing organization at BioMarin are set up<br>for a steady growth in the very near term, followed by accelerated growth for approval of our late-stage programs, like valrox and<br>vosoritide. We are tremendously energized by the opportunities that lay at BioMarin. Thank you for your continued support and we<br>look forward to keeping you apprised over the coming quarters.<br>

Good morning, and welcome to the Cogent Communications Holdings Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder,<br>this conference call is being recorded and it will be available for replay at www.cogentco.com.<br>
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dave Schaeffer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cogent Communications Holdings. Please go<br>ahead.<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Hey, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. I'm Dave Schaeffer, Cogent's CEO.<br>And with me on this morning's call is Tad Weed, our Chief Financial Officer.<br>
We are pleased with our results and our outlook for 2018 and beyond. We achieved sequential quarterly<br>
(technical difficulty)<br>
growth of 1.8% and year-over-year quarterly growth for the fourth quarter of 8.3%. Our quarterly sales rep productivity improved again from 5.7<br>units installed per full time equivalent rep per month to 5.8 units per rep per month. And again, that is significantly above our historical average<br>of 5.1 units installed per full time equivalent rep per month.<br>
Our EBITDA for the quarter increased sequentially by 7.6% and by $3 million and increased by $6.2 million and 16.6% from the fourth quarter of<br>2016. For the full year 2017, our EBITDA increased by $18.4 million or by 12.9% over the full year 2016. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter increased<br>sequentially by 180 basis points and increased by 240 basis points to 34.5% from the fourth quarter of 2016. Our gross margins for the quarter<br>increased sequentially by 50 basis points to 51.7% and increased by 30 basis points from Q4 of 2016. For the quarter, we achieved accelerated<br>increases in our traffic growth. We achieved sequential traffic growth of 12%, a significant increase from the 8% sequential growth rate in the last<br>quarter. And we also achieved acceleration in our year-over-year traffic growth to 29%.<br>
During the quarter, we returned $21.8 million to our shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend. As posted on our website, 50.2% of our<br>total of $81.7 million of dividends in 2017 should be treated by shareholders as a return of capital and 49.8% should be treated as taxable dividends<br>

for U.S. federal tax purposes. At quarter end, we had a total of $41.5 million available in our stock buyback authorization program which is expected<br>to continue through December of 2018. We did not purchase any stock in the quarter.<br>
Our gross leverage ratio improved to 4.44 from 4.57 last quarter, and our net leverage ratio declined to 2.94 this quarter from 3.00 last quarter. We<br>ended the quarter with $247 million of cash on our balance sheet. Of this cash, $62.9 million is held at the holding company, Cogent Holdings, and<br>is unrestricted and available for dividends and/or buybacks. We continue to remain confident with the growth potential of our business and the<br>cash generating capabilities of the business. As a result, as indicated in our press release, we announced another $0.02 sequential increase in our<br>regular quarterly dividend, raising our quarterly dividend from $0.48 a share per quarter to $0.50 per share per quarter, representing our 22nd<br>consecutive quarter in which we have raised our regular quarterly dividend<br>
(technical difficulty)<br>
detail some of the certain operational trends and highlights of our business.<br>
(technical difficulty)<br>
some additional details on our financial performance. And then following our prepared remarks, we'll open the floor for questions and answers.<br>
I'd now like to turn it over to Tad to read our safe harbor language.<br>
<b>Thaddeus G. Weed</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer &amp; Treasurer<br>
Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. This earnings conference call includes forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements<br>are based upon our current intent, belief and expectations. These forward-looking statements and all other statements that may be made in this<br>call that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our SEC<br>filings for more information on the factors that could cause actual results to differ. Cogent undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking<br>statements. If we use any non-GAAP financial measures during this call, you'll find these reconciled to the GAAP measurement in our earnings<br>release which is posted on our website at cogentco.com.<br>
I'll turn the call back over to Dave.<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Hey, thanks, Tad. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our earnings press release. Our press release includes a number of consistently reported<br>historical quarterly metrics as well as current performance.<br>
Now with regard to expectations and our long-term guidance going forward, our targeted long-term guidance remains for a full year constant<br>currency growth rate of between 10% and 20%. Our long-term EBITDA as adjusted annual margin expansion targets remain approximately 200<br>basis points per year. We expect those trends to continue for the next several years.<br>
Our revenue and EBITDA guidance are intended to be long-term goals and are not intended to be used as specific quarterly guidance. Our EBITDA<br>as adjusted is impacted by the amount of equipment gains and net neutrality fees as well as certain seasonality in our SG&amp;A.<br>
Now Tad will provide you some additional details on our year and quarter specific financial results.<br>

<b>Thaddeus G. Weed</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer &amp; Treasurer<br>
Thanks, Dave, and again, good morning to everyone. I'd like to thank and congratulate the entire team at Cogent for their results and continued<br>hard work and efforts during another very busy year and a very productive year and quarter for the company.<br>
We analyze our revenues, again, based upon network type, which is on-net, off-net and noncore. And we also analyze our revenues based upon<br>customer type. And we classify all of our customers into 2 types, either NetCentric customers or Corporate customers. Our NetCentric customers<br>buy large amounts of bandwidth from us in carrier neutral data centers and our Corporate customers buy bandwidth from us in large multitenant<br>office buildings.<br>
Revenue from our Corporate customers grew sequentially by 2.9% to $78.7 million and year-over-year grew by 11.7%. We had 38,006 Corporate<br>customer connections on our network at quarter end. Quarterly revenue from our NetCentric customers grew sequentially by 0.1% and year-over-year<br>grew by 3.1%. We had 33,607 NetCentric customer connections on our network at quarter end. Our NetCentric revenue growth experiences more<br>volatility than our Corporate revenue growth due to the impact of foreign exchange and other seasonal factors.<br>
Revenue and customer connections by network type. Our on-net revenue was $89.4 million for the quarter, which was a sequential quarterly<br>increase of 1.7% and a year-over-year increase of 7%. Our on-net revenue was $346.4 million for the year, which was an increase of 7.1% over full<br>year 2016. Our on-net customer connections decreased sequentially by 3.3% and increased by 16% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with<br>over 61,300 on-net customer connections on our network in our 2,506 total on-net multitenant office buildings and carrier neutral data center<br>buildings. Our off-net revenue was $35.7 million for the quarter, which was a sequential quarterly increase of 2.3% and a year-over-year increase<br>of 11.9%. Our off-net revenue was $137.9 million for the year, which was an increase of 12.7% over last year. Our off-net customer connections<br>increased sequentially by 2.4% and increased by 15.8% year-over-year.<br>
(technical difficulty)<br>
9,900 off-net customer connections and about 6,300 off-net buildings and these buildings are primarily in North America.<br>
Some comments on pricing. Consistent with our historical trends, the average price per megabit of our installed base and for our new customer<br>contracts decreased for the quarter. The average price per megabit for our installed base declined sequentially by 8.7% from last quarter to $0.99<br>and declined by 21.1% from the fourth quarter of last year. The average price per megabit for our new customer contracts declined sequentially<br>by 22.9% to $0.42, as we sold to larger customers compared to last quarter, and declined by 42.1% from our new customer contracts that were<br>sold in the fourth quarter of last year.<br>
Comments on ARPU, which decreased sequentially. Our on-net ARPU, which includes both Corporate and NetCentric customers, was $494 for the<br>quarter, which was a sequential decrease of 1.7%. Our off-net ARPU, which is comprised predominantly of corporate customers, was $1,208 for the<br>quarter, which was a sequential decrease of 0.9%. Churn rates were stable during the quarter. Our on-net churn rate was 1.1% this quarter compared<br>to 1% last quarter. And our off-net churn rate was 1.2% this quarter compared to 1.1% last quarter.<br>
On [move back] change orders. We offer discounts related to contract term to all of our Corporate and NetCentric customers. We also offer volume<br>commitment discounts to our NetCentric customers. During the quarter certain NetCentric customers took advantage of our volume and contract<br>term discounts and entered into long-term contracts for over 2,500 customer connections which increased their [revenue commitment] to Cogent<br>by over $22.5 million.<br>
Some further comments on EBITDA and EBITDA as adjusted. Our EBITDA and EBITDA as adjusted are reconciled each quarter to cash flow from<br>operations in all of our press releases. As adjusted includes gains related to our equipment transactions. Our quarterly EBITDA as adjusted increased<br>by $3 million or by 7.3% sequentially to $43.6 million and year-over-year increased by $5.8 million or 15.4%. Our EBITDA as adjusted increased by<br>$14.5 million or by 9.7% for the year. Our EBITDA as adjusted margin increased sequentially by 180 basis points to 34.8% and increased by 200<br>basis points from the fourth quarter of last year.<br>

<A name=510></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, CCOI - Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call<br>
Our equipment gains, that's included in the EBITDA, as adjusted were $0.3 million for this quarter, a decline from $0.7 million from the fourth quarter<br>of last year and $0.4 million last quarter. The gains for the year were $3.9 million this year, a reduction from $7.7 million in 2016. Our quarterly<br>EBITDA increased by $3 million or by 7.6% sequentially to $43.2 million and increased year-over-year by $6.2 million or 16.6%. And our EBITDA<br>increased by $18.4 million or by 12.9% for the year. Our quarterly EBITDA margin increased sequentially by 180 basis points to 34.5%, one of the<br>highest rates recently, and increased by 240 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016.<br>
We do have certain seasonal factors that typically impact our SG&amp;A expenses and consequently that impacts our EBITDA and EBITDA as adjusted<br>and those margins. And these include the resetting of payroll taxes in the United States at the beginning of each year, annual cost of living or CPI<br>increases, the timing and level of our audit and tax services and net neutrality fees and the timing and amount of our gains on our equipment<br>transactions and benefit plan annual cost increases.<br>
Some comments on earnings per share. As with many companies, the tax reform act impacted our income tax expense. So the signing of the Tax<br>Cuts and Jobs Act, which occurred in December of last year, reduced the corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, and that<br>resulted to an increase in our noncash deferred income tax expense by about $11.3 million booked in the fourth quarter and also impacted full<br>year 2017.<br>
Under U.S. GAAP, because of the change in the income tax rate, our net deferred tax assets had to be revalued in the fourth quarter using the lower<br>income tax rate, with the gross amount remaining unchanged. The rate change impact represented about $0.25 of a loss per basic and diluted<br>share, both for the quarter and for the year. As a result, our basic and diluted loss per share was $0.14 for the fourth quarter as compared to $0.08<br>in the previous quarter and $0.09 in the fourth quarter of last year.<br>
Our basic and diluted income per share was $0.13 for the full year compared to $0.33 last year. But if you exclude the $0.25 per share income tax<br>expense impact of this onetime $11.3 million adjustment, our basic and fully diluted income per share would have been $0.38, up from $0.33 for<br>full year and $0.11 increase as well for the fourth quarter.<br>
Foreign currency impact. Our revenue reported in U.S. dollars and earned outside of the United States is about 23% of our worldwide revenues.<br>About 17% of our fourth quarter revenues are based in Europe and about 6% of our revenues are related to our Canadian, Mexican and Asian<br>operations. Continued volatility in foreign exchange rates can materially impact our quarterly revenue results and our financial results. Foreign<br>exchange had no material impact on our sequentially quarter revenues this quarter, but from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter<br>of this year the year-over-year FX impact on our reported quarterly revenue was a positive $2.1 million and for the year it was a positive $1.9 million.<br>Our revenue growth on a constant currency basis, therefore, was 1.8% for the quarter sequentially, 6.6% over the fourth quarter of last year and<br>8.1% for the full year. The average euro to U.S. dollar rate so far this quarter is now $1.22 and the average Canadian dollar exchange rate is about<br>$0.80. Should these rates remain at these levels for the first quarter of this year, we estimate that the foreign exchange current impact on sequentially<br>quarterly revenues would be a positive about $800,000 and the impact on year-over-year quarterly revenues an approximate $3 million positive<br>impact.<br>
Customer concentration. We believe that our revenue and customer base is not highly concentrated and our top 25 customers represented less<br>than 6% of our revenues for the quarter.<br>
Some comments on capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.6 million compared to $7.2 million for the fourth<br>quarter of last year and $10.9 million for the previous quarter. Our capital expenditures were essentially flat for the year and were $45.8 million for<br>this year compared to $45.2 million last year.<br>
Comments on capital leases and capital lease payments. Our capital leases are for long-term IRU obligations and typically have initial terms of 15<br>to 20 years or longer and include multiple renewal options after the initial term. Our long-term and short-term capital lease obligations totaled<br>$157.5 million at year-end. And we have a total of 230 different dark fiber suppliers that we use. Our capital lease principal payments are for<br>long-term dark fiber IRU agreements and these payments were $1.8 million for the quarter and $11.2 million for the year. Capital lease principal<br>payments, if you combine that with our CapEx, declined by 12.6% sequentially and that amount was $12.5 million this quarter compared to $14.2<br>

At year-end our cash and cash equivalents totaled $247 million. And for the quarter, our cash decreased by $3.8 million as we returned $27.2 million<br>of capital to our stakeholders. During the quarter, we paid $21.8 million for our fourth quarter dividend and $5.3 million was spent on a semiannual<br>interest payment on our debt. For the full year our cash declined by $27.3 million, as we paid $81.7 million in our 4 quarterly dividends and $30.8<br>million was spent on interest payments on our debt.<br>
Some comments on debt and our ratios. Our total gross debt, which includes capital leases, was $732.5 million at year-end and our net debt was<br>$48.5 million. Our total gross debt to trailing last 12 months EBITDA as adjusted ratio improved to 4.44 at year-end from 5.57 last quarter. And our<br>net debt ratio also improved to 2.94 from 3 last quarter. Our bad debt expense was only 0.5% of our revenues from our quarter, which was an<br>improvement and was only 0.8% of our revenues for the year. Our days sales outstanding for worldwide accounts receivable was again only at 25<br>days at year-end. And as with every quarter, I want to again thank and recognize our worldwide billing and collections team for continuing to do<br>a fantastic job on customer service and collections.<br>
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Dave.<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Thanks, Tad.<br>
I'd like to take a moment and comment on the scope and scale of our network and our network expansion. The size of our network continues to<br>grow. We have over 893 million square feet of multitenant office building space connected to our network in North America. Our network consists<br>of 31,250 metro fiber miles and over 57,400 route miles of intercity fiber.<br>
The Cogent network is one of the most interconnected networks in the world. Today, we directly connect with over 6,150 networks. Less than 30<br>of these networks are settlement-free peers. The remaining networks are paying Cogent transit customers.<br>
We are currently utilizing approximately 29% of lit capacity in our network. We routinely augment capacity in segments of our network to maintain<br>these low utilization rates. For the quarter we achieved accelerated sequential traffic growth of 12% and an improvement in our year-over-year<br>traffic growth to 29%. We operate 53 Cogent-controlled data centers, with a grand total of 603,000 square feet of raised-floor space. We are today<br>operating those facilities at approximately 31% utilization rate.<br>
Our sales rep turnover rate was 3.5% for the quarter, significantly below our long-term average of rep turnover of 5.8%. We ended the quarter with<br>455 sales reps selling our service. This is the greatest number of quota-bearing reps in the company's history.<br>
Cogent is the low-cost provider of internet access transit services and VPN services and our value proposition remains unparalleled in the industry.<br>Our business remains completely focused on internet IP connectivity and data center colocation services. What we are providing is a utility to our<br>customers and they recognize the value that we deliver. We expect our annualized constant currency long-term revenue growth rates to be within<br>our historical norms of 10% to 20% top line and we expect our long-term EBITDA as adjusted margins on an annual basis to increase by approximately<br>200 basis points.<br>
Our board of directors approved yet another increase to our regular quarterly dividend, increasing that dividend by $0.02 per quarter per share,<br>to $0.50 per share per quarter. Our dividend increases recognize the continued optimism we have in the cash flow generating capabilities of our<br>business. Increasing the dividend and continued delevering is a sign of the strength in our business.<br>
We are optimistic about utilizing our buyback authorization and we'll try to take advantage of opportunistic situations to deploy the $41.5 million<br>remaining under our current buyback authorization, which continues through December of this year. We are committed to returning an ever-increasing<br>amount of capital to shareholders on a regular basis.<br>

<A name=512></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, CCOI - Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call<br>
With that, I'd like to open the floor for questions.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.<br>
<b>Matthew Niknam</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director<br>
Just 2 if I could. One, Dave, on revenue growth, so constant currency growth this quarter was about 6.6%. It's the lowest we've seen in some time.<br>Just wondering -- is this a little bit more of a newer reality at least in the interim? And then more specifically, what are the kind of catalysts do you<br>expect that help NetCentric growth reaccelerate? Because I think that's been the one piece of the business that the revenue growth has been<br>somewhat lagging. And then, secondly, just in terms of tax reform, wondering how that changes the company's outlook as it relates to both<br>investments in CapEx as well as capital allocation and shareholder returns.<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Thanks for the questions, Matt. So while our year-over-year quarterly constant currency growth rate was low, our constant currency sequential<br>growth rate in the fourth quarter was the best of the year, at 1.8%. We also do anticipate on a constant currency basis our growth rate to continue<br>to improve, both on a sequential basis and on a year-over-year basis. I think the year-over-year fourth quarter was specifically distorted by some<br>strong growth in the fourth quarter last year that we didn't have from several very large customers. We do expect our NetCentric growth to improve<br>from the 3.1% year-over-year growth rate that we delivered this year, which is substantially below our long-term average of 10% NetCentric growth<br>rate. We are continuing to see a improvement in our traffic growth rates. So our sequential growth rate improved on a quarterly basis from 8% the<br>previous quarter to 12%. Even accounting for seasonality, our year-over-year growth rate continued to improve and improved throughout the year<br>and ended up at 29%. That is still below our long-term average, but we are seeing consistent improvement as the negative impacts of violations<br>of net neutrality continue to fade. We see new customer business models. We see existing customers taking more traffic. And we do feel that our<br>NetCentric business will continue to improve, albeit at a slow pace, but consistently improve, while our Corporate business continues to perform<br>along historical trends and, quite honestly, quite consistent and quite well. The growth of 2.9% sequentially in that business and 11.7% year-over-year<br>demonstrates the durability and consistency in that business. Now with regard to tax reform, clearly it had an impact on our reported EPS due to<br>the reversal of the tax reserve that we had taken adjustment for. Secondly, the tax act does, I think, institutionalize for 4 years bonus depreciation<br>through 2022. That will most likely push out when Cogent will be a tax cash payer by about 3 years. We were initially anticipating having to make<br>structural changes to avoid cash taxes by mid-'19. Now I think that's more like mid-2022. We are still considering corporate structures and other<br>changes to our tax policies to further minimize long-term taxes. Now with regard to capital expenditures, Cogent expends capital based on the<br>expected rate of return. We have excess capital on our balance sheet, and yet we continue to moderate our capital spending. Our CapEx as measured<br>by CapEx and principal payments on capital leases declined, albeit modestly, from $57.7 million to $57.0 million on a year-over-year basis. We<br>expect those declines in absolute terms to continue going forward. Clearly, as a percentage of revenue the declines are more pronounced as we<br>continue to grow top line. We do not see bonus depreciation or any other changes in tax policy having us accelerate our capital spending, because<br>we don't think there are building opportunities to connect to that would generate sufficient returns. And we remain disciplined about our footprint<br>expansion.<br>

<b>Scott Goldman</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Dave, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the sales force expansion plans for 2018. I think you've been growing the sales force probably<br>high single digits, almost double digits at various times. Wondering how much of your growth outlook is dependent upon further sales force<br>expansions along the lines of what we've seen. And then secondly, Dave, you just mentioned sort of the tax reform not impacting the capital<br>spending side. But maybe you can just help us understand what the opportunity is in terms of adding buildings onto your network. It feels as<br>though over time you've sort of downplayed the multitenant office building opportunity, yet we continue to see that being almost an equal driver<br>as data centers in terms of adding buildings onto the network.<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Yes. Sure, Scott. So let me take each of those questions in order. We intend to grow our sales force between 7% and 10% for the year. We have a<br>significant addressable market opportunity and not enough sales people to cover that opportunity, both on-net and off-net. Our sales force is<br>roughly 72% Corporate, about 28% NetCentric. We intend to grow both portions of the sales force to attack each of those markets. We think that<br>the VPN migration away from MPLS to either VPLS or SD-WAN provides our Corporate reps with added addressable market opportunity. So as we<br>think about growing our business, we look at plenty of targets for us to sell to, a very predictable rate of price decline in the marketplace, both<br>Corporate and NetCentric after a number of years and a ability to continue to elevate our sales productivity. And the fact that we were able to go<br>from 5.7 units installed to 5.8 and yet we had the most number of reps in the company's history, 455, the most number of full-time equivalent reps<br>-- these are fully ramped reps -- of 429, our rep tenure continues to grow. So we will continue to invest in sales as the primary way to continue to<br>accelerate revenue growth. Now with regard to footprint expansion, we remain extremely disciplined about the type of buildings that we go into.<br>Now we go into data centers as new data centers are being constructed. And there continues to be a significant amount of capital going into the<br>data center market that has had us continue to add to that footprint at the rate of about 65 to 70 facilities per year. We are in 800 data center<br>buildings, with about 960 discrete data centers served. On the MTOB, or corporate multitenant office base, we continue to add about 60 a year.<br>That has slightly decelerated. As we've seen the economy improve there has been some new construction of large buildings. Our average building<br>size remains consistent at about 550,000 square feet per building. In fact, if you do the arithmetic on the last quarter, the average building that we<br>added in the fourth quarter, MTOB, multitenant office building, was actually larger than the average. But we do have a very defined list of which<br>buildings meet our criteria and we continue to go after those buildings, but we are not changing our criteria. We do not think the tax act has any<br>impact on that decision because it's driven entirely by return on capital. And then with regard to the tax act and our ability to return capital to<br>shareholders, dividends remained at the same tax rate. Corporate is lower but that has been not an important factor for Cogent. And we will<br>continue to try to be thoughtful about returning capital as opposed to issuing taxable dividends and using buybacks when appropriate. So I think<br>while the tax act is clearly a positive for business, it is not going to change the way we approach the market either to our customers or to our<br>shareholders.<br>
<b>Scott Goldman</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Great. One quick follow-up on the tax act, are you seeing -- understood in terms of what the impact is for you guys. Are you seeing any impact in<br>terms of the demand equation from your customers? Does it change -- help drive traffic acceleration now that maybe they're keeping a little bit<br>more in their coffers?<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
I don't think so, Scott. I mean, the drivers for internet traffic growth and corporate customers needing the internet are much more profound and<br>substantive than tax. The internet is a necessary utility to all of our customers. And what is driving their need for more bandwidth and more<br>connectivity are their business applications, not their tax decisions. On the Corporate side, we are seeing an accelerated pace of MPLS VPN<br>replacement with various over-the-top strategies that I think will provide significant tailwind to the Corporate business. On the NetCentric side, as<br>the noise of net neutrality dies down and all of the last mile networks that had previously decided to block traffic are now freely upgrading their<br>ports, we continue to see our NetCentric customers roll out new businesses, new applications. And the internet traffic growth is beginning to<br>

rebound for the whole industry, and clearly for Cogent it's rebounded. So while we grew 29% year-over-year, the industry is only growing at about<br>20%. So we're not at that 27%, 28% industry growth rate yet and we're not at the high 40s average Cogent growth rate.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.<br>
<b>Colby Alexander Synesael</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
Two questions, if I may. First off, on CapEx, I've had the opportunity to cover Cogent for quite some time now. And I think if I go back a few years,<br>at this point we're expecting CapEx to be -- and that includes cap leases -- to be in the low to mid-40s with a target of actually I think getting into<br>the high 30s at some point. Yet we're still at around that $57 million number that you referenced earlier. What's changed versus maybe expectations<br>a few years ago? And do you think that those lower numbers are still realistic? And then secondly, on growth specifically within the NetCentric<br>business and the 6.6% that was mentioned this quarter, you keep on mentioning net neutrality as one of the issues that is hindering growth. But<br>I have another thought that I wanted to suggest or get out there and see what you think. We've seen these hyperscale companies shifting a lot of<br>their traffic needs out to an on-net, so buy more dark fiber, buy more wave lengths. And it seems like that's coming at the expense of IP transit,<br>somewhat similar to how at one point they used to be big purchasers of CEN services and they brought that in house. Do you think that that's a<br>trend that you're seeing impact your business and traffic growth? And could that also be part of the reason for why the traffic has slowed?<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Yes, sure, Colby. Let me take both questions. First of all, on the CapEx question, our long-term CapEx guidance is that as methodically our capital<br>lease and CapEx number will approach about $35 million. Clearly, $57 million is above that and the rate of decline has been slower. Now what has<br>probably been a bit surprising over the past few years has been 2 things. One, the amount of data center footprint that Cogent has added to its<br>footprint, Cogent-owned data centers; and then secondly, the accelerated rate at which new third-party carrier neutral data centers are being built<br>as measured by either square footage or megawatts of power. And because of that we are extending our network more aggressively. We have also<br>extended our network to some new markets that were not initially contemplated, some of the Asia markets such as Singapore, Tokyo and Hong<br>Kong. We do continue to evaluate other areas of the world and possibly could grow to those areas. But we do expect our absolute CapEx that is<br>CapEx and principal payments on capital leases, to continue to decline, albeit at a slower rate of decline than we had expected. Now to the NetCentric<br>growth rates. First of all, it is absolutely true that larger hyperscale companies -- and Cogent serves virtually every one of them -- have their own<br>proprietary data center footprint and they have built networks to connect those data centers to one another and to connect those networks to<br>major exchange points. However, those companies continue to use transit services to connect to the internet. They have a discrete waterfall that<br>they look to migrate traffic off of their networks. First and foremost, they seek settlement-free peering agreements. If anyone will give them free<br>connectivity they will take it. And clearly that's a competitive offer that Cogent cannot, or does not want, to compete with. Secondly, they will use<br>paid direct connections. Those connections are typically more expensive than the market price for transit. And they will only use those if they are<br>forced to under contract or if they feel that the underlying interconnections are at risk from their transit providers. Those fears are going away. And<br>then, finally, transit, which is the easiest to use and most ubiquitous service with the lowest cost point, continues to be used by all of the hyperscale<br>players. In fact, we saw our traffic growth accelerate on a year-over-year and sequential basis. If your thesis was correct we would not see that. Now<br>there is traffic that previously existed on the internet that no longer exists on the internet through direct connections. We've seen, for example,<br>some of the over-the-top video providers take their traffic and no longer treat it as internet traffic, but rather as a channel on a linear closed cable<br>system. That traffic disappeared from the internet. It is no longer over-the-top traffic and it is now being delivered on a closed network. That trend<br>will probably continue for some of the largest providers. But the aggregate amount of internet traffic continues to grow and actually is now growing<br>at an accelerating rate. And for that reason, we feel optimistic that our NetCentric business is going to continue to improve, albeit at a slower pace<br>than we would have hoped.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.<br>
<b>Nicholas Ralph Del Deo</b> - MoffettNathanson LLC - Analyst<br>
First a capital structure one. So Dave, you've always described taking on debt as -- I think you've used the term renting cheap capital rather than a<br>more permanent decision. Rates remain pretty low by historical standards. But what would we have to see for your calculus regarding the appropriate<br>capital structure for the business start to change?<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Yes, fair enough. And I do view debt as temporary, not permanent capital; equity as permanent capital. And at Cogent, we have the luxury of<br>building our business without debt and then taking on debt to accelerate returns of capital to our stakeholders, and, quite honestly, suffered some<br>negative carry by carrying excess cash on our balance sheet, such as the $247 million that we currently have. Our debt is fixed term debt with<br>maturities in '21 and '22. Our debt also is trading above par. So therefore, the market is still pricing our debt below our coupon for that debt. Interest<br>rates have risen. We are probably in a short-term period of increased rates. Maybe this is my personal opinion, but I believe that the rate increases<br>will be more benign than people think and maybe more short-lived. The underlying growth rates are still somewhat muted for the economy and<br>interest rates around the world remain extremely low. Of all those reasons, we will keep the debt structure that we currently have in place through<br>those maturities. We may opportunistically look at extending maturities and/or increasing debt if it was cost effective. Today it is probably not.<br>And we maintain the flexibility to actually pay off our debt if rates do materially increase. And you can see that with the substantial improvement<br>in both our gross leverage and net leverage numbers. Our gross leverage improved sequentially from 4.57 to 4.44. That's a fairly material improvement<br>in a given quarter. Our net debt improved from 3.00 to 2.94, again sequentially, again, a pretty significant improvement in a single quarter. And<br>we expect those trends to continue for the next several quarters even with our increased dividend commitment.<br>
<b>Nicholas Ralph Del Deo</b> - MoffettNathanson LLC - Analyst<br>
All right. That's helpful. And then maybe one on the cost side. You run a pretty lean operation. Are there [any] cost savings opportunities out there<br>like real estate rationalization or consolidating cross connects or automation that you might be able to take advantage of going forward or that<br>have been helping results as of late?<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
So I think the answer is yes to all of the above. I appreciate the compliment that we run a lean operation. We try to be cost-effective. You saw a<br>material improvement on a sequential and year-over-year basis both in gross margin and in our SG&amp;A efficiency, resulting in our operating leverage.<br>Some comes from revenue growth. Some comes from continued real estate and other operational cost savings. We constantly evaluate our facilities,<br>figure out if we can lower their costs. On cross connects, we've continued to migrate away from 10 GB cross connects for customers or peers that<br>have a large amount of traffic, to 100 GB. That grooming process is a significant savings. And then in terms of automation, our primary business is<br>delivering Internet, not developing new IS systems. However, we do have internal process improvement teams. We do consistently do more with<br>less. And if you look at our headcount increases, almost all of our headcount, over 90% of the increase in employment at Cogent over the past year<br>came in the sales organization, with less than 10% of our aggregate increase in headcount coming in operations. That is indicating that while our<br>revenues grew at 8.6% and our traffic grew at 29%, the people that are actually producing the bit miles are becoming increasingly efficient. And<br>we expect those trends to continue or possibly even accelerate.<br>

<b>Michael Rollins</b> - Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD and U.S. Telecoms Analyst<br>
Dave, you talked about the opportunity for NetCentric to improve going forward. Is there a risk, though, that it could decline or have subpar<br>performance if certain things don't go your way in terms of customer acquisition or just the expectations that you have for traffic growth in the<br>category?<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Yes. Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. So clearly we need to be paranoid. Any business is at risk, and we cannot be complacent about our<br>improvement in performance or even in our current performance. We have 15 years of experience. We have relationships with over 6,120 transit<br>purchasing networks. That is more than anyone else in the world. We monitor our customers' traffic literally on a daily basis and see changes in<br>their traffic patterns, both in terms of volume and destination or source, depending on whether it's an access network or a content-producing<br>customer. And we are encouraged by the continued, albeit slower, improvement in aggregate internet traffic growth and our growth. We do not<br>generate the demand for internet traffic. Those are end users doing that. The death of the internet has been predicted many times. Colby alluded<br>to it with hyperscale carriers building their own networks. I've heard cross connects are going to put us out of business. CDNs are going to put us<br>out of business. Extended peering exchanges are going to replace transit. Transit continues to dominate the market because it is the easiest to use,<br>most ubiquitous and, most importantly, lowest cost way for anyone who has a large amount of content or needs to access a large amount of<br>content to get that content moved. Those trends are going to continue. Our NetCentric business and the growth in that business is dependent on<br>3 very simple principles. One, is the market going to continue to grow? Two, is Cogent going to be able to continue to win new customers? And if<br>you look at just the number of ASs connected in the progression in that path, it's been pretty consistent and improving and we continue to do<br>that. And then third, will we get a larger share of the wallet from those customers? And you actually saw some indication of that even this quarter.<br>Now it's a negative indicator in the sense that our rate of sequential new-sale decline was greater than it had normally been, being that large<br>customers were buying more of the traffic than small customers. There's a lot of dynamism in the NetCentric market. But we continue to grow and<br>we capture market share. And I feel very comfortable that we're going to see continued improvement. And again, the 3.1% year-over-year growth<br>is low by our historic standards, but it's still better than the 0% growth or even negative growth that we were experiencing at the height of port<br>congestion. And you see the results of that in the operating leverage of the entire business and the increase in our on-net business.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.<br>
<b>Timothy Kelly Horan</b> - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst<br>
Just a couple of clarifications. If you continue on these trends, it looks like you're going to head down to below 2.5x debt to EBITDA next year. Is<br>that what you're kind of saying, that you're okay to let that happen? Or do you want to kind of maintain the debt to EBITDA more in the 3x range<br>with stock buybacks? And then I had a follow-up.<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Yes, sure, Tim. So we have a stated range that we will maintain of between 2.5x and 3.5x on a net basis. We're actually below the midpoint and<br>trending down. We will maintain that range. And if we breach it on the low end, we would most likely either increase the pacing of our dividend<br>increases or be more aggressive about buybacks. That's a hypothetical. We're not there today. But we are committed to this leverage range. Now<br>to the question Nick asked, if interest rates materially spike, we may reevaluate that. But we're not talking about a 100 or even 200 basis point<br>increase. Anything within that range, our thinking would stay consistent. And we are delevering at a fairly significant rate and we are growing our<br>dividend. These are good problems to have.<br>

So 2 different questions. Our goal is to kind of hover around the middle of the range, to be honest. That doesn't mean we would tolerate being<br>below that. Buybacks are something to use opportunistically. And the increase in volatility may give us some opportunity. But markets are still at<br>all-time highs. With regard to our interest rates, remember, part of our interest rate is driven by our capital lease imputed interest, which we have<br>no control over. That is really the capital lease issuer's decision and based on the market points when we took on that debt through the capital<br>leases. With regard to the, I would call it more discretionary debt, our 2 high-yield instruments, the coupons are 5 3/8% and 5 3/8%. Both are trading<br>above par. And I think the current mark-to-market on those is about 4.2 for the secured debt and about 4.5 for the unsecured debt. And with the<br>underlying increase in the 10-year, I think we're doing pretty well. I don't think there's a lot of opportunity for us to refinance that to a lower rate.<br>And there is a make-whole associated with it.<br>
<b>Thaddeus G. Weed</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer &amp; Treasurer<br>
Well, the blended rate on capital leases is about 10 1/2%. So that's obviously part of the interest expense. And that has to do -- several of those<br>were entered into many years ago when rates were much higher, and those rates do not change. When you enter into the lease agreement, you<br>continue to use that rate throughout the term.<br>
<b>Timothy Kelly Horan</b> - Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst<br>
Got it. And then just lastly, Dave, on the corporate side on the connections, can you talk about maybe the percentage of the base that is more kind<br>of virtual private line versus kind of incremental new sales? You might not give the exact number. But just qualitatively, are you seeing a lot more<br>or higher percentage of kind of virtual private line versus the base?<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Yes, we are absolutely seeing an acceleration in VPLS business, our VPN business. Today it's about 25% of the corporate base, about 17% of total<br>revenues. We have not yet productized and rolled out an SD-WAN product. We have fully tested those products in our labs and expect to roll out<br>a SD-WAN product in the next couple of quarters. We think that will further accelerate the VPN part of our corporate business, because now<br>customers will have 2 choices of technology as opposed to just the VPLS choice that we offer today.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.<br>
<b>Frank Garrett Louthan</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Wanted to talk about sort of the sales force mix. And when do you think you can get a higher mix of the NetCentric salespeople? It's been a goal<br>for a while. Just want to see how that's there. And then on the data center utilization, fairly low relative to some of the public guys. What do you<br>think you could do to maybe to get some better utilization in those data centers? Or is that calculated sort of excluding some of the space you use<br>for yourself? Or how should we think about that?<br>

<A name=518></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, CCOI - Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Okay. So the calculation is what is net rentable. It does not include Cogent utilization within the centers for our equipment. Two, we did see a slight<br>uptick from 30% to 31% sequentially in the quarter in terms of utilization. And we did not add any new data center footprint. We also have about<br>18 months ago implemented a data center certification program for our sales force. If a rep goes through that additional training and passes it,<br>they actually get some additional compensation on data center sales, which has helped us sell additional rack and power in our footprint. Our data<br>centers are relatively low power density. So it is probably not totally fair for us to compare them to some of the other operators. We have about 70<br>megawatts across our footprint or about 125 watts per square foot as opposed to most public operators at about 250 watts per square foot. So<br>there are some structural differences. But there are many customers, mostly corporate, who our data center is a very good footprint and fit for, and<br>we expect to see that continue to grow. It represents about 2.9% of revenues and 4.9% of our actual connections, our rack and power, in our data<br>centers. Now with regard to the NetCentric sales force, we are continuing to grow that force. And we do anticipate that over 2018, the growth rate<br>of NetCentric salespeople will be greater than that of corporate. Both sales organizations will grow, but there will be probably a greater emphasis<br>on NetCentric as we're seeing the underlying demand in that segment continue to improve.<br>
<b>Frank Garrett Louthan</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
And just to follow up on the data center. So I appreciate the lower power density. Maybe asked a different way, what will your utilization look like<br>if you looked at it, say what percentage of your 70 megawatts that you have that you have sold? Would that be a higher percentage? So I would<br>assume higher power density gear is taking less floor space, but using substantially more power. So how would the metrics stack up under that<br>sort of scenario?<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
They would actually be the same. And the reason is, we measure based on the restriction of the data center. So some data centers, the limiting<br>factor is power, some are cooling and some are square footage. So when we put the theoretical number out there, it's actually built off of the most<br>constricted variable on each of the 53 centers. So there's no one answer to that. But I do think that we could sell across the footprint 3x as much<br>data center space and, therefore, revenue as we're currently getting.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks.<br>
<b>David Schaeffer</b> - Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, CEO &amp; President<br>
Well, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. We are encouraged about the growth in our business and, most importantly, the<br>operating leverage that we continue to demonstrate. The 12.9% year-over-year growth in EBITDA, I think is a strong indication of how our business<br>is performing. And in particular, all of that growth is organic, which leaves us, I think, in the best position in our sector. So again, I want to thank<br>everyone for joining us, and I look forward to seeing you all soon.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone<br>have a great day.<br>

<b>a. </b>Several which Co. expects to close of next [few] months, including licensees in US, Germany and France and taking initial<br>
20% stake in Avis Budget licensee in Greece.<br>
<b>5. </b>Bought back 1.9m shares at cost of $73m.<br>
<b>a. </b>At avg. price of $39.59 per share.<br>
<b>6. </b>For 2017, share repurchases totaled 6.1m shares at cost of $200m or $32.87 per share.<br>
<b>a. </b>Represented approx. 6% of Co.'s current market cap.<br>
<b>F. Balance Sheet:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Financial position remained strong.<br><b>2. </b>Available liquidity approx. $5.7b.<br><b>3. </b>4Q17-end:<br>
<b>a. </b>Cash $611m.<br><b>b. </b>Having $1b of available capacity on revolving credit facility plus $4.1b capacity under vehicle programs, reflecting<br>
seasonality of business.<br>
<b>4. </b>Net corporate leverage 4.06 times continue to hover around top of targeted range of 3-4 times.<br>
<b>a. </b>2017-end leverage ratio for covenant purposes 3.92 times, almost a turn below the maximum ratio of 4.75 times as then<br>
defined.<br>
<b>5. </b>As Co. announced last week, amidst stronger credit market conditions, extended both components of senior credit facility<br>
with favorable terms and with no change to interest rate charged.<br>
<b>a. </b>Revolving portion of facility was extended two years to 2023.<br><b>b. </b>Term loan components was extended by three years to 2025.<br>
<b>6. </b>As part of amendments, financial covenant was changed from consolidated leverage ratio; for instance, what is called Co.'s<br>
first lien leverage ratio.<br>
<b>a. </b>Onto the amendments, total amount now borrowed only just onto senior credit facility, cannot exceed 2.5 times<br>
consolidated EBITDA.<br>
<b>b. </b>Based on 2017 consolidated EBITDA, and term loan balance of 2017-end, leverage and new covenant would pro-forma<br>
have been 1.4 times at Dec. 31.<br>
<b>7. </b>Aforementioned amendments therefore provide significant additional headroom and improved robust liquidity profile.<br>
<b>G. US Tax Reform:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Passage of recent Tax Act resulted in initial estimated net benefit of $213m.<br>
<b>a. </b>Resulting from $317m revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities from change in corporate tax rates, partially offset by<br>

<b>i. </b>Implementation of new revenue recognition accounting standard in Jan. 2018 and in anticipation of adopting new<br>
leasing standard in Jan. 19, Co. has reviewed relevant to key reported metrics.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Ensures comparability to metrics period-over-period, Co. will now begin to measure and report pricing using total<br>
revenue per day, defined as total revenue including all brands divided by rental days.<br>
<b>iii. </b>Per-unit fleet cost which now to ensure consistency with revenue metrics, comprises all brands that now includes US<br>
truck business, which was previously excluded from this metric.<br>
<b>iv. </b>[Tax revenue] moving to loyalty program.<br>
<b>4. </b>Due to adoption of new revenue recognition accounting standard, each transaction that generates customer loyalty points<br>
will now resulted in deferral of revenue.<br>
<b>a. </b>Expects this revenue deferral related to loyalty will negatively impact Americas reported pricing by around 50-75 BP in<br>

<b>7. </b>Guidance onto previous time and mileage metrics would have been broadly similar.<br><b>8. </b>Americas per unit fleet costs to be down 1% to up 1%.<br>
<b>a. </b>Partially due to model year 2018 buy, which had prices coming in couple of percentage points lower than prior year.<br>

<b>10. </b>International per unit fleet costs to be flat to up 2% in local currency.<br><b>11. </b>Faces number of cost headwinds in 2018, which will impact results.<br>
<b>a. </b>Includes resetting and marketing budgets and incentive compensation and approx. $20b higher vehicle interest expense<br>
resulting for rising US interest rates plus effect of volume growth on all vehicle interest costs.<br>
<b>i. </b>These effects are partially offset by higher utilization and annualization of 2017 mitigating actions and approximate<br>
$25-35b currency benefit through adjusted EBITDA.<br>
<b>12. </b>Adjusted EBITDA to increase to $740-820m.<br><b>13. </b>Effects of increased marketing spending this year should be most pronounced as percentage of revenue in 1Q.<br>
<b>a. </b>This effect will be exacerbated by timing of loyalty accounting, [broadly neutral] across whole year, however, the negative<br>
impact on adoption in 1Q.<br>
<b>14. </b>Given faster leisure growth Co. has seen in past few years, profits now skew even more towards middle two quarters.<br>
<b>a. </b>These factors are expected to limit 1Q profit improvements.<br>
<b>15. </b>Non-vehicle depreciation and amortization, excluding acquisition-related amortization to be approx. $210m.<br><b>16. </b>Adjusted EPS $2.90-3.75, benefiting from pre-tax profit growth and lower expected tax rate.<br><b>17. </b>Free cash flow $325-375m.<br>

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.<br>
<b>Chris Jon Woronka</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
I wanted to ask you as you think about how pricing unfolded in the fourth quarter, how do you bucket that between maybe<br>industry-wide supply, some of your own revenue initiatives and demand growth? Is there a way to parse that out if you can?<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, what I'd say is that we've been working really hard on the commercial side of the business to really start targeting segments<br>of the business that produced a higher rate per day. So we've been really zoning in on our mid-market accounts and our small<br>business accounts to try to bring more higher-rated per-day business into the segment. You couple that with we had just a really<br>robust Thanksgiving and Christmas season. A very, very strong robust Christmas season. And I think also DFP, the Demand Fleet<br>

Pricing system, continues to yield benefit for us when we get into those really peak periods where we're able to really yield our<br>pricing up and that's what it was really designed to help us do. And we're seeing that play through as well as we looked at Thanksgiving<br>and Christmas.<br>
<b>Chris Jon Woronka</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Okay, great. I guess the follow-up is on some of the mobility initiatives and specifically Waymo, but maybe some others that you<br>haven't announced yet. How do you generically see that unfolding over the next several years? Is there -- is '18 a much bigger year<br>than '17? Or is '19 more -- I'm just curious as to your thoughts as to how maybe your involvement evolves over time.<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, definitely we'll continue to expand our operations with Waymo as they continue to expand and add thousands of new cars to<br>their program. We are talking to other mobility solution providers as far as how we might be able to partner with them and I think<br>we'll start to see some of those unfold as well over '18 and into '19. And then I think as you look at our connected car initiative and<br>the opportunities to partner with people as we expand our connected car program into more fleet, it is definitely a longer-term<br>approach to how we can drive more efficiencies into the business and drive revenue opportunities through partnerships, through<br>connectivity, as well as the service improvements that we can offer our customers as well. So I think there is a number of steps that<br>will unfold over a number of years. And I think you'll continue to see us move down the mobility path each year, year-after-year, as<br>it continues to grow as an important part of how we're going to develop our business over time.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research.<br>
<b>John Michael Healy</b> - Northcoast Research Partners, LLC - MD &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
Larry, I was hoping you could talk just a little bit about maybe the trends that you've seen in the first quarter as it relates to kind of<br>pricing in the U.S. with 2 months almost in to the quarter. Have you seen that momentum that you saw on the leisure side in the<br>fourth quarter continue on? Or have you seen any sort of breakage there?<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, we're not really commenting on what actual pricing has been going on in the quarter. What I would say is that a couple of<br>things. One is that the dynamic -- the industry are what you would normally expect in the first quarter. The times of the week and<br>the weeks of the quarter that you would expect for the industry to be tight on fleet, the industry has been, and on the times of the<br>quarter where you would expect it not to be, it hasn't been. The first quarter is more of a commercial quarter. There's not much<br>activity other than the spring break, but they don't drive the volume of business that causes the industry to really run out of cars, as<br>like Thanksgiving and like Christmas does. So the first quarter is typically a more commercial quarter. So you're not going to find as<br>many opportunities for things like DFP to work and really be able to yield up your pricing. But what I would say is that the first quarter<br>is not at all like we've been experiencing in the last few years. It's back to what you would normally expect first quarter fleet to be<br>behaving like. And with the Easter kind of the 1st of April, you might get a couple days of benefits in the end of March. But there's<br>just not a lot of peak activity happening in the first quarter.<br>

<A name=529></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, CAR - Q4 2017 Avis Budget Group Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>John Michael Healy</b> - Northcoast Research Partners, LLC - MD &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
Understood. And then I wanted to ask just a little bit about fleet interest cost. I've gotten a lot of questions about how you guys may<br>be impacted by rising rates and the amount of maturities that you have on the fleet size coming up the next couple of years. When<br>you guys look at the pieces of debt that will fall off, say in '18 and '19, and what you might be able to replace those pieces at, how<br>do you see fleet interest expense trending maybe over the next 2 to 3 years given the current rate environment that we are in today?<br>
<b>Martyn Smith</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - Interim CFO<br>
Yes, it's Martyn. So I called out a likely extra cost in 2018 of about $20 million. That is simply the U.S. interest rate, or the point you're<br>picking up on the variable fleet debt. The Eurozone, we're expecting to be flat for 2018 and a little bit of pick up in Australia and New<br>Zealand. But really, it's the U.S. story at the moment. And then probably 2019 onwards, further U.S. increases and then the Eurozone<br>then picking up. So we've got about $1.5 billion naturally coming off next year and then we're replacing. So our $20 million reflects<br>essentially our anticipation of those maturities come through as the renewal as well. So there will be quite an increase progressively<br>coming up over the next couple of years. But it's obviously industry-wide, not just ourselves.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.<br>
<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Larry, I'm wondering how the industry-wide fleet is in the U.S. Looking at the fourth quarter, your fleet continued to grow in the<br>same lines as where volume was, so utilization was flat. And I think from your comments, you planning to undergrow your expected<br>volume increase for the year to drive utilization up. Curious to what you're seeing from a discipline standpoint from your major<br>competitors.<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes. Just first of all, about our fourth quarter fleet coming in at about flat on the utilization perspective. What really drove that -- I<br>mean, our intent is to build a fleet to underdemand. We're going to continue to drive utilization, and we have that built into our plan<br>for 2018. What happened really in the fourth quarter is when the hurricane -- the first hurricane hit, we actually pulled forward<br>deliveries that were going to be delivered late in the quarter, beginning of the first quarter this year, to help meet that demand of<br>relief work demand, plus where we just thought fleets were going to tighten up for insurance replacement business that other car<br>rental companies might take. We pulled some fleet forward into the quarter. And when the relief business didn't materialize, or at<br>least didn't stay the length that we had plans for it and how it has really occurred in previous hurricanes as we discussed in the last<br>quarter call, we had that fleet then in the quarter earlier and longer than we had really needed it. So the team worked really hard as<br>they went through the rest of the quarter to try to disperse that fleet, get it on rent and to delete fleet where possible, to get ourselves<br>back to kind of a flat position and also to be able to ensure that we have the right fleet for the opportunities for Thanksgiving and<br>Christmas. So they did a really good job. Looking back now would we have pulled as many cars forward as we did? No. But we<br>expected the relief business to be stronger and longer than it was. As far as the industry fleet levels, I would say, they were pretty<br>typically normal. I think other people also brought fleet forward, so the hurricane does kind of throw a little bit of difficulty into<br>looking at the quarter. But once you get past that and you just take a look at how the rest of the quarter unfolded and how we turned<br>into the year, I would say fleet levels are back to what you would consider a normal year and a normal turn into the new year.<br>

<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Okay, understood. And just a little bit in line of question earlier. I know you don't want to talk about what you're seeing so far for the<br>first couple of months. But it would seem as if the fourth quarter pretty strong from a pricing perspective, but your full year even<br>when we adjust for the accounting change still implies slightly down from what the 4Q '17 levels were. Is that just an abundance of<br>caution? Or is that indicative of what you're seeing so far in the first quarter understanding it's seasonably weak?<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, I don't think you want to plan the full year pricing based on how you perform at Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we've had<br>some difficult years in pricing the last few years. And so we are looking at our year-over-year trends, we're looking at how we exited<br>the year. We're taking all that into consideration. As we take -- we build our volume coming from the ground up. We don't just take<br>the volume that we did last year and lap on an increase. We literally built it up account by account by account and our partnerships<br>so forth and we get to where we really think our volume is going to be. And so we -- the pricing reflects what we think will really<br>happen as we transition out of what's been a very difficult period for the last few years and some more normalized periods. And I<br>hope we're wrong. I hope that pricing would be even stronger than that. We do have the loyalty impact that is impacting the year<br>and will definitely impact more the first quarter the rest of the year. But no, I don't -- I wouldn't say it's a conservative approach. What<br>I'm saying is that we just -- we need more than just at Thanksgiving and a Christmas to be more aggressive than what we're seeing.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie.<br>
<b>Mario Cortellacci</b> - Macquarie Research - Associate<br>
This is Mario filling in for Hamza. Could you give us an update on what you're seeing in business travel and whether you believe tax<br>reform could lead to more of a pickup? And also, could you update us on your current market share in business travel?<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, as I said earlier, we've been working really hard on trying to grow some of the other segments in the corporate channel business.<br>The large commercial accounts continue to be very competitive from everyone trying to win those accounts to the pricing that's<br>offered in those accounts. We've -- we're not losing those accounts. We're hanging onto those accounts. We're hanging on to our<br>share of those accounts. So we've been really focusing more of our attention on our mid-market and small business accounts, trying<br>to win more of that business. It's a longer haul to do that, but if we stay focused on it as we were all last year, we'll continue to drive<br>more volume and commercial at a higher rate than what you're going to get with the large commercial accounts. And we're starting<br>to see that pay off. As Martyn said, we've had kind of 2 months -- or 2 quarters in a row here where we've been able to improve --<br>keep our pricing flat on commercial and we've seen volume growth in the fourth quarter as well, small volume uptake in the fourth<br>quarter as well in the Commercial business. So that's far better than where we had been in the beginning part of last year and the<br>year before. So we're staying focused on building that, but now from a share perspective, we're holding onto our share, we're holding<br>onto our account and we're trying to build those other segments that come at a higher profitability.<br>
<b>Mario Cortellacci</b> - Macquarie Research - Associate<br>
Okay. And just one more and I'll turn it over. Could you give us a sense of whether or not, in infrastructure build, it goes through, will<br>it have any impact on the car rental industry? Or maybe you could frame how we should be thinking about that.<br>

<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, I think it does because I think anytime that you kind of invest in airports and create a better environment for consumers to<br>transit to the airport to create better facilities, better traffic flows, those all help the rental car industry. So we're a big component of<br>the infrastructure bill. We want to see the investments made to modernize our airports and modernize our road and I think all of<br>those play well to someone that's in the mobility business like we are to have roads that are up to date and to have the latest<br>technology in the airports that we serve.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Derek Glynn with Consumer Edge Research.<br>
<b>Derek J. Glynn</b> - Consumer Edge Research, LLC - Associate<br>
This is Derek on for Jamie. I'm wondering if you could elaborate more on the International environment, what you're seeing from<br>competitors and whether you think fleet size is more rational now versus prior quarters.<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
The pricing environment internationally continues to be really tough. We're -- we've been really fighting this fight now for the last<br>couple of years and it doesn't really seems to be getting -- there doesn't seem to be strategic changes in the competition that's going<br>to change anytime soon. That's why we're rolling out our pricing robotic and then eventually we'll get to the final phases of DFP<br>there as well so that it can have the benefit, our International team can have the benefit of being able to forecast further out, be able<br>to take advantage of more yielding opportunities, have the confidence that fleet will tighten up in periods so that they can make<br>decisions further out to drive more length of rental, improve their utilization. So those things are all actions that we're taking to<br>improve pricing from our own perspective, but the industry dynamic really aren't changing. We are seeing a growth of the third tier<br>segment, providers allowed people getting into kind of the lower tier offering. It really started and kind of worked to go in Spain<br>and expanded into Italy and now starting to expand into some other countries as well. And that's something that we're going to<br>need to contend with as far as how we compete in that the third tier. So yes, things are -- we're managing through it. And as we said,<br>they had a really good year last year overall. But they did -- they weren't helped by pricing. They had to do it for a lot of other hard<br>work, driving volume, cost cutting, being more efficient, and we would, we would really want to see pricing improve there.<br>
<b>Derek J. Glynn</b> - Consumer Edge Research, LLC - Associate<br>
Okay, got it. And then just a point of clarification. Did you guidance for 2018 include any assumptions around buybacks?<br>

<b>Dan Meir Levy</b> - Barclays PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
So I want to start by asking about your pricing guide. Within your expectation for total RPD flat, I think it's really more like up half a<br>point to 2.5 points x the headwind from the accounting change you mentioned. Could you just break out your underlying assumptions<br>for core time and mileage versus ancillary? And I have asked this because, last year, on a total RPD basis, it was down roughly 2 points,<br>ancillary down I think low-single digits as well. Just what's -- what are the broad strokes or what's driving the turnaround in ancillaries<br>because I know it's been under pressure in the past?<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes. I think if you were to put our guidance in context of our old metric, it would be pretty much the same. Our ancillary revenue has<br>been under pressure. And as we've said, and we are working hard to kind of turn that around, we're pretty excited about what we're<br>seeing online. Our online team has been working really hard on how to present ancillary products in a more clear, concise and<br>understandable way on the website so people will really clearly understand what their options are. And also in the bundling initiative<br>that we launched for the end of last year where we're putting products together so it makes it easier for customers to be able to click<br>on a bundled product. And we're seeing nice uptake on that, particularly on Avis.com. So we've got some work to do. It's more and<br>more people move to mobile apps and website, and we're seeing improvement in conversion of customers on our site. More and<br>more bookings are coming from that channel, more and more people buying -- using the prepaid option as well. We've got to find<br>more ways to be able to offer those products to consumers kind of no matter which device they're going to. So we've got some more<br>work to do on the mobile app as well. We're excited by the usage of the mobile app, but we got to make sure that we can offer<br>ancillary products in a way that people can clearly take advantage of them and do it timely.<br>

And then within the core time and mileage piece, does that assume it to be positive as well? Assumed modestly?<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes. That was assumed that time and mileage would be positive. Yes.<br>
<b>Dan Meir Levy</b> - Barclays PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Got it. And then just one follow-up. If I take the midpoint of your guide for EBITDA price and fleet costs, it implies that while the net<br>of your fleet cost and price should be positive, you're still guiding to margin roughly flat versus '17. I think typically what we've seen<br>in the past is when the net of fleet cost and price is positive it implies margin expansion. So why is it that you're not looking for<br>margin expansion in '18 despite you seem to view that the net of this variable is positive?<br>
<b>Martyn Smith</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - Interim CFO<br>
We'd like to achieve that. I called out headwinds earlier, so we've got things we're stepping back into, particularly marketing expense<br>and incentive comp coming through as well and the U.S. interest rate I discussed earlier. The headwinds are essentially holding back<br>some expansion in 2018.<br>

<A name=533></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, CAR - Q4 2017 Avis Budget Group Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Michael Millman</b> - Millman Research Associates - Research Analyst<br>
Not to be particularly picky, but you mentioned -- or you characterized fleet as being normal. I'm not sure if normal means what we<br>saw in the first half or the second half kind of related to that, we're seeing OEMs always talking about, again, reducing sales to other<br>car rental business. Does this suggests that fleets may have -- may well be tighter in 2018 than they were at least in the second half<br>of 2017? Yes, '17.<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Michael, this is Larry. Yes, I certainly hope so. The OEMs have been decreased -- some of the OEMs have been decreasing sales to the<br>fleet industry. We saw that in the '18 buy, and we saw that in the '17 buy as well. When I talked about kind of back to normal, I really<br>mean, I refer back a few years ago prior to industry issues that some competitors had in the industry as far as over-fleeting or having<br>the wrong mix, which has caused over-fleeting to occur. So we're kind of back to prior to those types of problems in the industry. I<br>feel like we're kind of back to the period before that. Can they always get tighter? Sure. And I'm sure every rental car company is<br>working on trying to find those times when they can have their cars during the valleys as low as they possibly can and the cars during<br>the peak as high as they possibly can to meet that peak. So through our fleet optimization team, through the data that we're now<br>being able to integrate into the optimization models. We're just getting more and more sophisticated about how we buy our cars,<br>using data and third party data to help us figure out how to buy our cars, when to buy our cars, where to infleet them and where to<br>exit them at what -- kind of what stage of their lives to really maximize residual values, you can also be able to have the cars in the<br>market that we need them at the time those market peak. As you can imagine, the markets we serve across the United States, that's<br>a very complicated model to work and our guys run these models every day, all day long, to make sure that we're constantly tweaking<br>and changing our fleet to make sure that we try to drive that utilization benefit. We had flat utilization really for the year. And that<br>was actually remarkable. When you think about us switching, transitioning in 2017 to go up 10 points in risk-cars over program car.<br>What that means is that you have a lot fewer short-term cars that you could turn back quickly to bring your fleet levels down and to<br>be able to make that transition and be able to drive flat utilization when the majority -- when a much bigger part of your fleet is a<br>longer-term fleet hold. We took a lot of effort by optimization teams and the guys in the field to really be able to deliver on that. So<br>we're kind of through that end point improvement transition and risk. And now we can go into next year with, I'd say we're going<br>into '18 with a risk fleet that is similar to our '17 risk fleet. And that allows us to continue to find us opportunities to try to drive<br>utilization up and the team is very focused on that in '18.<br>
<b>Michael Millman</b> - Millman Research Associates - Research Analyst<br>
So, I guess, related to bit. When you talk about 0 to 2% U.S. -- Americas increase in pricing, should we look at that as similar to the<br>fourth quarter where it was more like 5% on leisure and flat on commercial? Or do you see that mix shifting in some way?<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, I think what you'll find is that we're continuing to shift more of our business towards leisure. It will cost more fleet speaking, if<br>you will, in the third quarter and at the end of the second quarter and third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter. So that's just<br>kind of how the business shifting. As I said, we're not losing share in the corporate business, that we are starting to see more leisure<br>business coming through. Our leisure -- in those periods, our fleets are tight, which they now have -- fleets are more normal when<br>they get tight or peak periods of leisure travel, we're seeing leisure rates move up fairly significantly. I think the large commercial<br>accounts, as I said, will continue to be very competitive. And so I wouldn't expect big price improvement in that segment.<br>

to find ourselves in this situation. We will address these matters in more detail at a later date and plan to keep the Q&amp;A portion of today's call<br>focused on our financial results and our strategy.<br>
Now turning to the quarter. As I look back at 2017, despite operating in an extremely challenging environment in the first half of the year, we made<br>significant and substantial strides that will solidify our position in the vehicle rental and mobility industry, enabling us to provide better products<br>and services to our customers, while also increasing shareholder value. Steps such as, significantly increasing our fleet of connected cars; launching<br>the industry's first mobility lab; partnering with Waymo to support its fleet of autonomous vehicles; launching our fully integrated Demand Fleet<br>Pricing system; making strategic investments in our business that will lower our costs and further our leading position in the rapidly changing<br>mobility landscape; and generating $354 million of adjusted free cash flow; and repurchasing $200 million of our own shares. And we ended the<br>year on a very positive note. We had a strong fourth quarter driven by good global volume growth, increased pricing, including our second<br>consecutive quarter of positive pricing in the Americas and stable fleet costs. Our emphasis on driving manpower and shuttling efficiencies continued<br>to yield positive results and our commitment to cost management was also effective in the quarter with our adjusted EBITDA margin improving<br>year-over-year.<br>
But before getting ahead of myself, I would like to now turn the call over to Martyn to discuss our results for the fourth quarter as well as our outlook<br>for 2018.<br>
<b>Martyn Smith</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - Interim CFO<br>
Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'm now going to discuss our fourth quarter results together with our fleet, cash flow, liquidity and<br>outlook for the full year, together with an update on the effects of U.S. tax reform and of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. My<br>comments will largely focus on our adjusted results, which, as Neal mentioned, are reconciled from our GAAP numbers both in our press release<br>and earnings call presentation.<br>
Firstly, starting with an overview of our fourth quarter. Strong volume growth and positive pricing led to total company revenue increasing by 7%.<br>Fleet costs in the Americas were unchanged year-on-year, a significant improvement to the first half, while International fleet costs were 5% lower<br>in local currency. This, in conjunction with our cost mitigating actions and the $5 million benefit from foreign exchange, led to a 16% improvement<br>in our adjusted EBITDA to $140 million for the quarter with a 50 basis point improvement in margin.<br>
For the whole of 2017, we increased total company revenue by 2% to $8.8 billion, driven by strong 5% volume growth and 2% lower local currency<br>pricing. Company-wide per-unit fleet costs increased by 3% in local currency, partially offset by the cost mitigating actions implemented throughout<br>the year. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA was $735 million.<br>
Now to go into further detail on the results, starting first with the Americas. Our focus on driving the most profitable transactions through improved<br>channel and customer mix were evident in this quarter. Leisure volume and pricing each increased 5%, achieving a particularly strong Christmas<br>season. Commercial volume and pricing were both unchanged in the quarter, the second consecutive quarter of flat rate per day, as we focused<br>on the most profitable commercial customers. This performance resulted in a 3% improvement on Americas revenue for the quarter, with overall<br>pricing increasing by more than 2% in local currency. Across all of 2017, we grew Americas volume by 2%, while pricing was 1% lower, but rate per<br>day improving in the second half of the year.<br>
Now turning to Americas costs, particularly fleet. Per-unit fleet costs increased 6% for the full year, but were flat in quarter 4 with used car prices<br>continuing their recovery from the first half of 2017, helped by small benefit from post-hurricane effects, and, and you will hear more in detail<br>shortly, a great performance in alternative disposition channels. Despite a difficult start to the year and hurricane-related disruptions, utilization<br>still improved by 13 basis points in 2017. With our strategy to keep our fleet tight relative to demand, we plan to further improve utilization this<br>year, assisted by the approach to our model year '18 buy, where we consciously contracted for fewer vehicles compared to model year '17. We<br>continue to see benefits from our strategic initiative to sell more of our risk fleet through alternative disposition channels. In the quarter, alternative<br>channels accounted for 54% of our risk car sales compared to 42% in the prior year. For the full year, 50% of our risk cars were sold outside of<br>traditional auction channels compared to 37% in 2016, and we have plans in place to further increase that percentage again in 2018.<br>

As a reminder, the benefit from selling through these alternate channels is substantial, which is why I'm so excited about the progress we made in<br>2017 and the opportunities still ahead of us. I'm also pleased with the way our teams pulled together in the quarter to drive savings for our cost<br>mitigation efforts. And as you will hear from Larry shortly, we made further progress to improve productivity in the quarter, both for our manpower<br>planning and shuttling strategic initiatives. Consequently, Americas adjusted EBITDA increased 6% in the quarter to $107 million, driven by revenue<br>growth as well as from the benefits of greater efficiencies and our cost saving measures.<br>
Now turning to our International segment. We grew revenue substantially at 12% in local currency for the quarter. Pricing improved 1% in local<br>currency year-over-year. Rental days increased 15%, including an 8% benefit from the France Cars business, which was acquired in December 2016,<br>and benefiting from a particularly strong Christmas break in Europe and a good summer in Australia. This performance was evenly spread with our<br>EMEA and APAC businesses benefiting from robust organic volume growth increasing 7% and 8% respectively. We drove volume -- sorry, we drove<br>commercial volume growth in the quarter up 10% year-over-year with particularly strong demand in Australia, Germany and Italy. We also achieved<br>good leisure volume growth, increasing 5% year-on-year with robust demand in France, Spain and Australia; and inbound volume was healthy,<br>up 6% for the quarter. International per-unit fleet costs were 5% lower in quarter 4 in local currency. This, combined with a strong revenue growth,<br>a good overall cost performance and a $4 million currency exchange benefit led to adjusted EBITDA increasing 25% in the quarter or 13% in local<br>currency. For the full year, International revenue increased 6% in local currency and 8% reported, with a 12% increase in volume, partially offset<br>by 3% lower local currency pricing.<br>
Combined with International per-unit fleet costs of 1% lower in local currency, benefits from our cost mitigating actions and a $24 million benefit<br>from currency, full year International adjusted EBITDA increased by 12% to a record $305 million.<br>
Now to move on to our cash flow and funding position, plus an overview of the material effects from U.S. tax reform and the new revenue recognition<br>standard.<br>
Starting with cash flow. In spite of the challenges faced in 2017, we generated $354 million of adjusted free cash flow. Non-fleet CapEx was $198<br>million, which was in line with our non-vehicle depreciation. For 2018, we expect to spend around $220 million on non-fleet CapEx as we increase<br>investment in certain growth initiatives, particularly connected cars. We also have a pipeline of strategically attractive tuck-in acquisitions, some<br>of which we expect to close over the next few months, including license fees in the U.S., Germany and France, as well as taking an initial 20% stake<br>in our Avis Budget licensee in Greece.<br>
We bought back 1.9 million shares at the cost of $73 million in the fourth quarter at an average price of $39.59 per share. For the full year, our share<br>repurchases totaled 6.1 million shares at the cost of $200 million or $32.87 per share. Repurchases for the year represent approximately 6% of our<br>current market cap. Our financial position remains strong with approximately $5.7 billion of available liquidity. It comprised ending the quarter<br>with $611 million of cash and having $1 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facility, plus $4.1 billion capacity under our vehicle<br>programs at the end of 2017, reflecting the seasonality of our business.<br>
Our net corporate leverage of 4.06x continues to hover around the top of our targeted range of 3 to 4x. However, our leverage ratio for covenant<br>purposes at year-end was 3.92x, almost a turn below the maximum ratio of 4.75x as then defined. As we announced last week, amidst strong credit<br>market conditions, we extended both components of our senior credit facility with favorable terms and with no change to interest rate charged.<br>The revolving portion of the facility was extended 2 years to 2023, and the term loan component was extended by 3 years to 2025. In addition, as<br>part of the amendment, the financial covenant would change from a consolidated leverage ratio to instead what is called a first lien leverage ratio.<br>Under the amendment, the total amount now borrowed only under the senior credit facility cannot exceed 2.5x consolidated EBITDA.<br>
Based on our 2017 consolidated EBITDA and term loan balance at year-end, leverage under our new covenant would pro forma have been 1.4x at<br>December 31. These amendments, therefore, provide significant additional headroom and improve on our already robust liquidity profile.<br>
Before moving to our 2018 guidance, I want to briefly discuss the impact of U.S. tax reform and some changes we are making for financial reporting<br>going forward. First, the passage of the recent tax act resulted in us reporting an initial estimated net benefit of $213 million in the quarter, resulting<br>from the $317 million revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities from the change in corporate tax rate, partially offset by $104 million one-time<br>tax charge on cumulative foreign earnings. These initial estimates will be trued up later in the year.<br>

<hr>
<A name=539></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, CAR - Q4 2017 Avis Budget Group Inc Earnings Call<br>
We presently intend to use existing NOLs to settle the tax due on foreign earnings, rather than paying cash over the 8-year period. In addition, as<br>a result of that tax act, we anticipate our effective tax rate will be lower going forward, and currently expect it to be between 25% and 27%.<br>
Second, we are making some changes on our reporting. As you saw the outlook section and the tables earnings of our release last night, along<br>with the implementation of the new revenue recognition accounting standard on January 20, 2018, and in anticipation of adopting the new leasing<br>standard in January '19, we have reviewed our relevant key reported metrics. As a result of that review, going forward, to ensure comparability to<br>our metrics period-over-period, we will now begin to measure and report pricing using total revenue per day, defined as total revenue including<br>all of our brands divided by rental days. We will focus on this metric expressed in local currency, and will also show separately the FX impact and<br>reported currency metrics as well. We believe this is helpful to both management and investors as it represents the meaningful measure of overall<br>pricing, including the effects of bundling. This definition is also more comparable to others in the industry.<br>
We have provided in Table 6 of last night's earnings release our prior years' revenue per day to show the last 8 quarters calculated under our new<br>pricing metric definition so that you can update your model. Just to note that, in addition, we've also provided in Table 7 per-unit fleet costs, which<br>now, to ensure consistency with our revenue metric comprises all brands, so now includes our U.S. truck business which was previously excluded<br>from this metric.<br>
Back to revenue and moving to our loyalty program. As a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standards, each<br>transaction that generates customer loyalty points will now result in a deferral of revenue and that revenue being subsequently recognized on<br>customer redemption or forfeiture. Previously, we did not defer revenue, but instead recorded an operating expense associated with the costs of<br>providing the future rentals under the then-prevailing accounting rules. We expect this revenue deferral related to loyalty will negatively impact<br>Americas reported pricing by around 50 to 75 basis points in 2018, including an approximate 1 point impact in the first quarter of the year with<br>the effects progressively decreasing as the year goes on. This change is broadly profit neutral across the year, primarily impacting where the cost<br>is recorded on the income statement. To confirm, there is no cash impact from this change.<br>
With those considerations in mind, now to turn to our 2018 outlook. We expect our revenues to grow between 4% and 7%, including an approximate<br>$160 million to $180 million currency benefit. Americas volume is expected to be between 1% and 3% and International volume growth to be<br>between 5% and 7%. We expect pricing for the Americas to be in the range between unchanged to up 2% versus prior year, and International local<br>currency pricing to be flat to down 2%. Our guidance is based on new revenue per day metric and includes the approximately 50 to 75 basis point<br>effect we are anticipating in 2018 related to the accounting change for our loyalty program on our Americas pricing, which I discussed earlier.<br>Guidance under the previous time and mileage metrics would have been broadly similar. We expect our per-unit fleet costs in Americas to be in<br>the range down 1% to up 1%. This is partially a result of our model year '18 buy, which had prices coming in a couple of percentage points lower<br>than the prior year. Implicit in our guidance is the expectation that market values of late model used cars will be lower this year, and we expect<br>International per-unit fleet costs to be flat to up 2% in local currency.<br>
And as we noted previously, we face a number of cost headwinds in 2018 which will impact our results. These include the resetting in marketing<br>budgets and incentive compensation as well as the approximately $20 million higher vehicle interest expense resulting from rising U.S. interest<br>rates, plus the effects of volume growth on our vehicle interest cost. These effects are partially offset by high utilization, which I discussed earlier,<br>and the annualization of our 2017 mitigating actions, as well as an approximate $25 million to $30 million currency benefit to adjusted EBITDA. As<br>a consequence, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to increase to between $740 million and $820 million.<br>
It is also important for me to point out that the effects of the increased marketing spending this year should be most pronounced as a percentage<br>of revenue in the first quarter. This effect will be exacerbated by the timing of loyalty accounting, being broadly neutral across the whole year,<br>however, with a negative impact on adoption in the first quarter. In addition, given the faster leisure growth we have seen in the past few years,<br>our profits now skew even more towards the middle 2 quarters. These factors are expected to limit our first quarter profit improvement. We expect<br>-- we estimate our non-vehicle depreciation and amortization, excluding acquisition-related amortization, to be approximately $210 million. We<br>expect our adjusted EPS to be between $2.90 and $3.75 per share, benefiting from both pretax profit growth and the now lower expected tax rate.<br>We expect our free cash flow to be between $325 million and $375 million.<br>

Lastly, we currently plan to deploy around $100 million of this free cash flow for the strategic tuck-in acquisitions, which I discussed earlier. In line<br>with our practice in recent years, we also intend to continue to return capital to shareholders. This will likely be in the second half of 2018, broadly<br>matching our seasonal cash flow.<br>
In summary, we saw a strong fourth quarter driven by global volume growth and increased pricing in the Americas. We made marked improvements<br>in our ability to dispose through lower cost channels in 2017, an initiative we will continue in 2018. We recently modified the terms of our senior<br>credit facility both extending its maturity and gaining greater covenant headroom. We have an attractive pipeline of both growth CapEx and<br>strategic tuck-in acquisitions, both in the Americas and International regions. And we remain highly positive about our business and are projecting<br>both revenue and profits to grow this year despite facing a number of headwinds.<br>
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Larry.<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Thank you, Martyn. Before we take questions, I wanted to discuss some of our strategic initiatives that we believe have the ability to drive meaningful<br>and sustainable margin expansion over time as we demonstrated in the fourth quarter, while also enabling us to succeed in the growing market<br>for mobility services.<br>
Starting with profitable revenue growth. Our fully integrated Demand Fleet Pricing yield management system which makes recommendations<br>about both pricing and fleet based on the forecasted demand is now live in 12 markets. We are finding that the improvements in our length of<br>rental and utilization that we saw in our smaller pilot markets are applicable to larger markets as well. This gives me great confidence as we roll<br>the full system out across the rest of the United States. And in Europe, the first phase of the system, the Pricing Robotic, is now live in over 50<br>markets, allowing us to be far more responsive to changes in the marketplace with full market coverage expected ahead of this year's summer<br>peak.<br>
Our initiatives to drive incremental bookings through our direct channels are also producing great results. Conversion rates in the Americas increased<br>by 120 basis points in the quarter, while prepaid reservations increased 600 basis points year-over-year, and now represent over 35% of reservations<br>made on our proprietary platform. Ancillary revenue continued to be a challenge in the fourth quarter, but the bundling initiative we launched at<br>the end of last year is showing promise, particularly on the Avis brand. We have also made ancillaries easier to select for customers that book on<br>our website and I'm excited about the early results. Americas' ancillary sales grew 4% on avis.com in the quarter, including an 8% improvement<br>for the month of December.<br>
Our Avis mobile app also continues to be a big success story. The app gives customers the ability to not only make a reservation, but to instantly<br>exchange and upgrade their vehicle at any time, even as they stand in front of the car in the lot. The app has now been used in more than 1 million<br>rentals since its launch and 55% of users have used the app multiple times. The success of the app is clear with Net Promoter Scores 25% higher<br>for preferred customers who use the app than those who do not. The progress we have made with the Avis app which was developed with insights<br>from our customers is yet another way we are exceeding their expectations and differentiating ourselves from our competitors.<br>
We have great travel partners around the world and we recently added to those ranks. In November, we entered into a multi-year agreement with<br>Choice Hotels under the agreement the Avis and Budget brands were named preferred car rental partners for Choice Hotels and their Choice<br>Privileges rewards program, enabling us to drive incremental volume as we market our products and services to their 33 million members worldwide.<br>In December, we further strengthened our ranks as strategically important partners by entering into a multi-year agreement with Hawaiian Airlines,<br>making Avis Budget Group their exclusive rental car partner. Hawaii continues to be a popular destination for not only American travelers, but<br>among travelers from other countries as well. With enplanements growing 5% in 2017 and continued growth forecasted for 2018, we grew our<br>Hawaiian revenue double digits in 2017 and this agreement puts us in a premier position to further capitalize on this growth going forward. And<br>we extended our exclusive partnership with American Airlines, the world's largest airline, earlier this year for an additional 4 years.<br>
In addition to great partners, we also have strong licensees around the world, which is why I'm so excited that our licensee for the Budget brand<br>in Japan recently signed an agreement to take on the Avis brand as well. The Avis brand has been absent from Japan for over 14 years. So to<br>

reintroduce our iconic premium brand into a market as large as Japan is great news for us as well as Japanese consumers. And with Japan hosting<br>the Rugby World Cup 2019 and the Olympics in 2020, the timing couldn't have been better.<br>
Moving now to our initiatives to drive cost savings and efficiencies across our organization. Our new manpower planning technology has now<br>been completely rolled out across all United States cities, allowing us to move -- to most effectively match our staffing levels to our business peaks,<br>driving a 5% improvement in year-over-year productivity in the quarter. We expect this initiative to drive further savings in 2018 as we achieve a<br>full year benefit from our technology investment.<br>
We also continue to see nice improvement in our shuttling initiatives leading to a 9% year-over-year reduction in shuttling per transaction in the<br>quarter with additional benefits expected in 2018. We've also been making investments in technology to strengthen our underlying core systems<br>while driving further costs out of our business. These include a major rebuild of our main reservation and rental system which will be completed<br>this year. The implementation of Workday, a cloud-based human resource system, to which all our employees are now connected. As well as<br>modernizing our financial systems on to a new cloud-based, globally unified application, a journey we embarked on last year. Each of these<br>investments is strategic to running the business and provides enormous flexibility to enable us to take advantage of future technological changes.<br>
Turning now to Mobility. We continued to innovate in new ways to cater to our customers' needs with our Zipcar brand. Zipcar Flex, our floating<br>product offering in the United Kingdom, which allows members to drop their car off at any permitted location, continued its expansion in London<br>in the fourth quarter with additional boroughs slated for 2018. With more and more municipalities in Continental Europe now requiring car-sharing<br>companies to offer a floating product in order to compete in the market, Flex is an important addition to Zipcar's product lineup. And in the U.S.,<br>our Zipcar commuter service is now available to 90% of our Zipcar customer base. This monthly service, which offers our customers recurrent<br>weekly use of a car including insurance and a designated parking spot, provides a cost-effective alternative to car ownership. We substantially<br>expanded this offering since the end of Q3 and have seen a healthy month-over-month demand growth for this service. In November, we announced<br>Kansas City as our market for the Connected City pilot. And after only a few short months, I'm even more convinced that connected cars will enhance<br>our business, both from an operational standpoint and from a customer experience perspective. Vehicles in the Kansas City area are able to tell us<br>when they need to be serviced and when they are ready to be put back on rent. A connected car's ability to measure fuel consumption allows a<br>clearer billing process for our customers. And our teams have identified additional opportunities to drive productivity and improve customer<br>satisfaction. We've also partnered with Continental to integrate keyless functionality into our connected cars. With this technology, a customer<br>can lock, unlock and start their rental car from their Avis mobile app. We successfully demonstrated this new technology at last month's Consumer<br>Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and are excited to bring this technology to our customers. Moving forward, we are partnering with OEMs and other<br>third parties to expand our connected car capabilities with the goal of more than doubling our connected car fleet in 2018.<br>
Our partnership with Waymo, the autonomous driving division of Alphabet, also continues to move forward with expanded services. As a reminder,<br>our company entered into a partnership with Waymo to provide fleet services for their self-driving car program in Phoenix in June. We have locations<br>that are in full operation and servicing the Waymo fleet of autonomous cars. Waymo has moved into their deployment phase, operating vehicles<br>on public roads without a test driver, and we're excited about their plans to add thousands more vehicles to their fleet. We remain committed to<br>expanding our operations to accommodate Waymo's growth and are enthusiastic about the opportunities to learn and benefit from this partnership.<br>
To summarize, despite a difficult first half, our business rebounded nicely in the second half of the year with pricing and fleet costs in the Americas<br>improving significantly, and we reached 50% alternative disposition channels sales in the Americas for the first time since we started this initiative.<br>We also drove further improvement in our manpower and shuttling efficiency initiatives and took aggressive cost saving actions leading to margin<br>improvement in the fourth quarter. We also drove meaningful improvement in our mobile conversion. Our Avis app has now been used in more<br>than 1 million rentals and the fully integrated Demand Fleet Pricing system was launched and is delivering on its promise. Our mobility efforts are<br>also bearing fruit as evidenced by our partnership with Waymo, the launch of Zipcar's commuter product and the expansions of Zipcar to Taiwan<br>and Costa Rica, and our work with RocketSpace to accelerate innovation and mobility. We signed new and exciting partnerships in 2017, including<br>Choice Hotels and Hawaiian Airlines. We're investing in long-term growth initiatives such as connected car. And as Martyn discussed, we extended<br>our term loan and amended our credit agreement without any increase in our interest rates. And while we continue to face some cost headwinds<br>going into this year, the initiatives we implemented in 2017 to strengthen our operations are providing tangible benefits and leave us well positioned<br>in 2018.<br>

With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.<br>
<b>Chris Jon Woronka</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
I wanted to ask you as you think about how pricing unfolded in the fourth quarter, how do you bucket that between maybe industry-wide supply,<br>some of your own revenue initiatives and demand growth? Is there a way to parse that out if you can?<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, what I'd say is that we've been working really hard on the commercial side of the business to really start targeting segments of the business<br>that produced a higher rate per day. So we've been really zoning in on our mid-market accounts and our small business accounts to try to bring<br>more higher-rated per-day business into the segment. You couple that with we had just a really robust Thanksgiving and Christmas season. A very,<br>very strong robust Christmas season. And I think also DFP, the Demand Fleet Pricing system, continues to yield benefit for us when we get into<br>those really peak periods where we're able to really yield our pricing up and that's what it was really designed to help us do. And we're seeing that<br>play through as well as we looked at Thanksgiving and Christmas.<br>
<b>Chris Jon Woronka</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Okay, great. I guess the follow-up is on some of the mobility initiatives and specifically Waymo, but maybe some others that you haven't announced<br>yet. How do you generically see that unfolding over the next several years? Is there -- is '18 a much bigger year than '17? Or is '19 more -- I'm just<br>curious as to your thoughts as to how maybe your involvement evolves over time.<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, definitely we'll continue to expand our operations with Waymo as they continue to expand and add thousands of new cars to their program.<br>We are talking to other mobility solution providers as far as how we might be able to partner with them and I think we'll start to see some of those<br>unfold as well over '18 and into '19. And then I think as you look at our connected car initiative and the opportunities to partner with people as we<br>expand our connected car program into more fleet, it is definitely a longer-term approach to how we can drive more efficiencies into the business<br>and drive revenue opportunities through partnerships, through connectivity, as well as the service improvements that we can offer our customers<br>as well. So I think there is a number of steps that will unfold over a number of years. And I think you'll continue to see us move down the mobility<br>path each year, year-after-year, as it continues to grow as an important part of how we're going to develop our business over time.<br>

<A name=543></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, CAR - Q4 2017 Avis Budget Group Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>John Michael Healy</b> - Northcoast Research Partners, LLC - MD &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
Larry, I was hoping you could talk just a little bit about maybe the trends that you've seen in the first quarter as it relates to kind of pricing in the<br>U.S. with 2 months almost in to the quarter. Have you seen that momentum that you saw on the leisure side in the fourth quarter continue on? Or<br>have you seen any sort of breakage there?<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, we're not really commenting on what actual pricing has been going on in the quarter. What I would say is that a couple of things. One is that<br>the dynamic -- the industry are what you would normally expect in the first quarter. The times of the week and the weeks of the quarter that you<br>would expect for the industry to be tight on fleet, the industry has been, and on the times of the quarter where you would expect it not to be, it<br>hasn't been. The first quarter is more of a commercial quarter. There's not much activity other than the spring break, but they don't drive the volume<br>of business that causes the industry to really run out of cars, as like Thanksgiving and like Christmas does. So the first quarter is typically a more<br>commercial quarter. So you're not going to find as many opportunities for things like DFP to work and really be able to yield up your pricing. But<br>what I would say is that the first quarter is not at all like we've been experiencing in the last few years. It's back to what you would normally expect<br>first quarter fleet to be behaving like. And with the Easter kind of the 1st of April, you might get a couple days of benefits in the end of March. But<br>there's just not a lot of peak activity happening in the first quarter.<br>
<b>John Michael Healy</b> - Northcoast Research Partners, LLC - MD &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
Understood. And then I wanted to ask just a little bit about fleet interest cost. I've gotten a lot of questions about how you guys may be impacted<br>by rising rates and the amount of maturities that you have on the fleet size coming up the next couple of years. When you guys look at the pieces<br>of debt that will fall off, say in '18 and '19, and what you might be able to replace those pieces at, how do you see fleet interest expense trending<br>maybe over the next 2 to 3 years given the current rate environment that we are in today?<br>
<b>Martyn Smith</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - Interim CFO<br>
Yes, it's Martyn. So I called out a likely extra cost in 2018 of about $20 million. That is simply the U.S. interest rate, or the point you're picking up on<br>the variable fleet debt. The Eurozone, we're expecting to be flat for 2018 and a little bit of pick up in Australia and New Zealand. But really, it's the<br>U.S. story at the moment. And then probably 2019 onwards, further U.S. increases and then the Eurozone then picking up. So we've got about $1.5<br>billion naturally coming off next year and then we're replacing. So our $20 million reflects essentially our anticipation of those maturities come<br>through as the renewal as well. So there will be quite an increase progressively coming up over the next couple of years. But it's obviously<br>industry-wide, not just ourselves.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.<br>
<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Larry, I'm wondering how the industry-wide fleet is in the U.S. Looking at the fourth quarter, your fleet continued to grow in the same lines as where<br>volume was, so utilization was flat. And I think from your comments, you planning to undergrow your expected volume increase for the year to<br>drive utilization up. Curious to what you're seeing from a discipline standpoint from your major competitors.<br>

<A name=544></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, CAR - Q4 2017 Avis Budget Group Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes. Just first of all, about our fourth quarter fleet coming in at about flat on the utilization perspective. What really drove that -- I mean, our intent<br>is to build a fleet to underdemand. We're going to continue to drive utilization, and we have that built into our plan for 2018. What happened really<br>in the fourth quarter is when the hurricane -- the first hurricane hit, we actually pulled forward deliveries that were going to be delivered late in<br>the quarter, beginning of the first quarter this year, to help meet that demand of relief work demand, plus where we just thought fleets were going<br>to tighten up for insurance replacement business that other car rental companies might take. We pulled some fleet forward into the quarter. And<br>when the relief business didn't materialize, or at least didn't stay the length that we had plans for it and how it has really occurred in previous<br>hurricanes as we discussed in the last quarter call, we had that fleet then in the quarter earlier and longer than we had really needed it. So the team<br>worked really hard as they went through the rest of the quarter to try to disperse that fleet, get it on rent and to delete fleet where possible, to get<br>ourselves back to kind of a flat position and also to be able to ensure that we have the right fleet for the opportunities for Thanksgiving and<br>Christmas. So they did a really good job. Looking back now would we have pulled as many cars forward as we did? No. But we expected the relief<br>business to be stronger and longer than it was. As far as the industry fleet levels, I would say, they were pretty typically normal. I think other people<br>also brought fleet forward, so the hurricane does kind of throw a little bit of difficulty into looking at the quarter. But once you get past that and<br>you just take a look at how the rest of the quarter unfolded and how we turned into the year, I would say fleet levels are back to what you would<br>consider a normal year and a normal turn into the new year.<br>
<b>David J. Tamberrino</b> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Okay, understood. And just a little bit in line of question earlier. I know you don't want to talk about what you're seeing so far for the first couple<br>of months. But it would seem as if the fourth quarter pretty strong from a pricing perspective, but your full year even when we adjust for the<br>accounting change still implies slightly down from what the 4Q '17 levels were. Is that just an abundance of caution? Or is that indicative of what<br>you're seeing so far in the first quarter understanding it's seasonably weak?<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, I don't think you want to plan the full year pricing based on how you perform at Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we've had some difficult<br>years in pricing the last few years. And so we are looking at our year-over-year trends, we're looking at how we exited the year. We're taking all that<br>into consideration. As we take -- we build our volume coming from the ground up. We don't just take the volume that we did last year and lap on<br>an increase. We literally built it up account by account by account and our partnerships so forth and we get to where we really think our volume<br>is going to be. And so we -- the pricing reflects what we think will really happen as we transition out of what's been a very difficult period for the<br>last few years and some more normalized periods. And I hope we're wrong. I hope that pricing would be even stronger than that. We do have the<br>loyalty impact that is impacting the year and will definitely impact more the first quarter the rest of the year. But no, I don't -- I wouldn't say it's a<br>conservative approach. What I'm saying is that we just -- we need more than just at Thanksgiving and a Christmas to be more aggressive than what<br>we're seeing.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie.<br>
<b>Mario Cortellacci</b> - Macquarie Research - Associate<br>
This is Mario filling in for Hamza. Could you give us an update on what you're seeing in business travel and whether you believe tax reform could<br>lead to more of a pickup? And also, could you update us on your current market share in business travel?<br>

<A name=545></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, CAR - Q4 2017 Avis Budget Group Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, as I said earlier, we've been working really hard on trying to grow some of the other segments in the corporate channel business. The large<br>commercial accounts continue to be very competitive from everyone trying to win those accounts to the pricing that's offered in those accounts.<br>We've -- we're not losing those accounts. We're hanging onto those accounts. We're hanging on to our share of those accounts. So we've been<br>really focusing more of our attention on our mid-market and small business accounts, trying to win more of that business. It's a longer haul to do<br>that, but if we stay focused on it as we were all last year, we'll continue to drive more volume and commercial at a higher rate than what you're<br>going to get with the large commercial accounts. And we're starting to see that pay off. As Martyn said, we've had kind of 2 months -- or 2 quarters<br>in a row here where we've been able to improve -- keep our pricing flat on commercial and we've seen volume growth in the fourth quarter as<br>well, small volume uptake in the fourth quarter as well in the Commercial business. So that's far better than where we had been in the beginning<br>part of last year and the year before. So we're staying focused on building that, but now from a share perspective, we're holding onto our share,<br>we're holding onto our account and we're trying to build those other segments that come at a higher profitability.<br>
<b>Mario Cortellacci</b> - Macquarie Research - Associate<br>
Okay. And just one more and I'll turn it over. Could you give us a sense of whether or not, in infrastructure build, it goes through, will it have any<br>impact on the car rental industry? Or maybe you could frame how we should be thinking about that.<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, I think it does because I think anytime that you kind of invest in airports and create a better environment for consumers to transit to the airport<br>to create better facilities, better traffic flows, those all help the rental car industry. So we're a big component of the infrastructure bill. We want to<br>see the investments made to modernize our airports and modernize our road and I think all of those play well to someone that's in the mobility<br>business like we are to have roads that are up to date and to have the latest technology in the airports that we serve.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Derek Glynn with Consumer Edge Research.<br>
<b>Derek J. Glynn</b> - Consumer Edge Research, LLC - Associate<br>
This is Derek on for Jamie. I'm wondering if you could elaborate more on the International environment, what you're seeing from competitors and<br>whether you think fleet size is more rational now versus prior quarters.<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
The pricing environment internationally continues to be really tough. We're -- we've been really fighting this fight now for the last couple of years<br>and it doesn't really seems to be getting -- there doesn't seem to be strategic changes in the competition that's going to change anytime soon.<br>That's why we're rolling out our pricing robotic and then eventually we'll get to the final phases of DFP there as well so that it can have the benefit,<br>our International team can have the benefit of being able to forecast further out, be able to take advantage of more yielding opportunities, have<br>the confidence that fleet will tighten up in periods so that they can make decisions further out to drive more length of rental, improve their utilization.<br>So those things are all actions that we're taking to improve pricing from our own perspective, but the industry dynamic really aren't changing. We<br>are seeing a growth of the third tier segment, providers allowed people getting into kind of the lower tier offering. It really started and kind of<br>worked to go in Spain and expanded into Italy and now starting to expand into some other countries as well. And that's something that we're<br>going to need to contend with as far as how we compete in that the third tier. So yes, things are -- we're managing through it. And as we said, they<br>had a really good year last year overall. But they did -- they weren't helped by pricing. They had to do it for a lot of other hard work, driving volume,<br>cost cutting, being more efficient, and we would, we would really want to see pricing improve there.<br>

<b>Derek J. Glynn</b> - Consumer Edge Research, LLC - Associate<br>
Okay, got it. And then just a point of clarification. Did you guidance for 2018 include any assumptions around buybacks?<br>
<b>Martyn Smith</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - Interim CFO<br>
Sorry, within the interest cost? Yes, the corporate interest rate, but it's net of that, yes.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays.<br>
<b>Dan Meir Levy</b> - Barclays PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
So I want to start by asking about your pricing guide. Within your expectation for total RPD flat, I think it's really more like up half a point to 2.5<br>points x the headwind from the accounting change you mentioned. Could you just break out your underlying assumptions for core time and<br>mileage versus ancillary? And I have asked this because, last year, on a total RPD basis, it was down roughly 2 points, ancillary down I think low-single<br>digits as well. Just what's -- what are the broad strokes or what's driving the turnaround in ancillaries because I know it's been under pressure in<br>the past?<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes. I think if you were to put our guidance in context of our old metric, it would be pretty much the same. Our ancillary revenue has been under<br>pressure. And as we've said, and we are working hard to kind of turn that around, we're pretty excited about what we're seeing online. Our online<br>team has been working really hard on how to present ancillary products in a more clear, concise and understandable way on the website so people<br>will really clearly understand what their options are. And also in the bundling initiative that we launched for the end of last year where we're putting<br>products together so it makes it easier for customers to be able to click on a bundled product. And we're seeing nice uptake on that, particularly<br>on Avis.com. So we've got some work to do. It's more and more people move to mobile apps and website, and we're seeing improvement in<br>conversion of customers on our site. More and more bookings are coming from that channel, more and more people buying -- using the prepaid<br>option as well. We've got to find more ways to be able to offer those products to consumers kind of no matter which device they're going to. So<br>we've got some more work to do on the mobile app as well. We're excited by the usage of the mobile app, but we got to make sure that we can<br>offer ancillary products in a way that people can clearly take advantage of them and do it timely.<br>

And then within the core time and mileage piece, does that assume it to be positive as well? Assumed modestly?<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes. That was assumed that time and mileage would be positive. Yes.<br>
<b>Dan Meir Levy</b> - Barclays PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Got it. And then just one follow-up. If I take the midpoint of your guide for EBITDA price and fleet costs, it implies that while the net of your fleet<br>cost and price should be positive, you're still guiding to margin roughly flat versus '17. I think typically what we've seen in the past is when the net<br>

of fleet cost and price is positive it implies margin expansion. So why is it that you're not looking for margin expansion in '18 despite you seem to<br>view that the net of this variable is positive?<br>
<b>Martyn Smith</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - Interim CFO<br>
We'd like to achieve that. I called out headwinds earlier, so we've got things we're stepping back into, particularly marketing expense and incentive<br>comp coming through as well and the U.S. interest rate I discussed earlier. The headwinds are essentially holding back some expansion in 2018.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates.<br>
<b>Michael Millman</b> - Millman Research Associates - Research Analyst<br>
Not to be particularly picky, but you mentioned -- or you characterized fleet as being normal. I'm not sure if normal means what we saw in the first<br>half or the second half kind of related to that, we're seeing OEMs always talking about, again, reducing sales to other car rental business. Does this<br>suggests that fleets may have -- may well be tighter in 2018 than they were at least in the second half of 2017? Yes, '17.<br>
<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Michael, this is Larry. Yes, I certainly hope so. The OEMs have been decreased -- some of the OEMs have been decreasing sales to the fleet industry.<br>We saw that in the '18 buy, and we saw that in the '17 buy as well. When I talked about kind of back to normal, I really mean, I refer back a few years<br>ago prior to industry issues that some competitors had in the industry as far as over-fleeting or having the wrong mix, which has caused over-fleeting<br>to occur. So we're kind of back to prior to those types of problems in the industry. I feel like we're kind of back to the period before that. Can they<br>always get tighter? Sure. And I'm sure every rental car company is working on trying to find those times when they can have their cars during the<br>valleys as low as they possibly can and the cars during the peak as high as they possibly can to meet that peak. So through our fleet optimization<br>team, through the data that we're now being able to integrate into the optimization models. We're just getting more and more sophisticated about<br>how we buy our cars, using data and third party data to help us figure out how to buy our cars, when to buy our cars, where to infleet them and<br>where to exit them at what -- kind of what stage of their lives to really maximize residual values, you can also be able to have the cars in the market<br>that we need them at the time those market peak. As you can imagine, the markets we serve across the United States, that's a very complicated<br>model to work and our guys run these models every day, all day long, to make sure that we're constantly tweaking and changing our fleet to make<br>sure that we try to drive that utilization benefit. We had flat utilization really for the year. And that was actually remarkable. When you think about<br>us switching, transitioning in 2017 to go up 10 points in risk-cars over program car. What that means is that you have a lot fewer short-term cars<br>that you could turn back quickly to bring your fleet levels down and to be able to make that transition and be able to drive flat utilization when<br>the majority -- when a much bigger part of your fleet is a longer-term fleet hold. We took a lot of effort by optimization teams and the guys in the<br>field to really be able to deliver on that. So we're kind of through that end point improvement transition and risk. And now we can go into next<br>year with, I'd say we're going into '18 with a risk fleet that is similar to our '17 risk fleet. And that allows us to continue to find us opportunities to<br>try to drive utilization up and the team is very focused on that in '18.<br>
<b>Michael Millman</b> - Millman Research Associates - Research Analyst<br>
So, I guess, related to bit. When you talk about 0 to 2% U.S. -- Americas increase in pricing, should we look at that as similar to the fourth quarter<br>where it was more like 5% on leisure and flat on commercial? Or do you see that mix shifting in some way?<br>

<b>Larry D. De Shon</b> - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, I think what you'll find is that we're continuing to shift more of our business towards leisure. It will cost more fleet speaking, if you will, in the<br>third quarter and at the end of the second quarter and third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter. So that's just kind of how the business shifting.<br>As I said, we're not losing share in the corporate business, that we are starting to see more leisure business coming through. Our leisure -- in those<br>periods, our fleets are tight, which they now have -- fleets are more normal when they get tight or peak periods of leisure travel, we're seeing leisure<br>rates move up fairly significantly. I think the large commercial accounts, as I said, will continue to be very competitive. And so I wouldn't expect<br>big price improvement in that segment.<br>

<A name=551></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, RRGB - Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call<br>
Last quarter, we talked about our commitment to leverage our brand and organizational strengths to stay strong in the near term while we make<br>the necessary changes to achieve continued long-term success. I'm pleased to report that we made excellent progress. We closed 2017 stronger<br>than we expected and are generally very pleased with trends and our team's success at controlling what we can. Even more importantly, we believe<br>we have the fundamentals in place to carry us through 2018.<br>
For the first time since I've been here, we closed the books on a full year with positive traffic up 40 basis points, that's 300 points plus ahead of the<br>casual dining category, which, of course, was down again for the year, according to Black Box. This annual outperformance was the best in over 5<br>years, and our fourth quarter marks 6 quarters in a row where we have outpaced competition and taken share.<br>
I consider this traffic outperformance even more meaningful today as consumers have more options than ever to choose from. I also believe the<br>winners in this category over time will be defined by their ability to continually connect with guests in the ways they prefer, with a strong brand<br>that can bridge different occasions and modes of access.<br>
Red Robin's performance last year benefited from both our multigenerational brand relevance and our agility to meet different guest needs while<br>making changes to the operating model that benefit the middle of the P&amp;L. Our operators continue to step up their game in on-premise dining<br>service as measured by Net Promoter Score, taking the dramatic improvements they made in 2016 even higher to an average NPS of over 70 with<br>under 7% detractors for 2017, not missing a beat with the guest while dropping the expediter role or what we call Maestro. They accomplished<br>this while significantly growing our off-premise business via carry out, third-party delivery and catering, which combined, were up 45% year-over-year<br>to an 8.3% mix in Q4. We deem this as good start toward our goal of mixing on par with others in the low to mid-teens.<br>
Our marketing team continue to fine tune messaging and media spending, targeting markets where we have the best unit penetration with<br>incremental corporate investment. They also continue to smartly segment and leverage our best-in-class Red Robin Royalty program, which is now<br>in its eighth year with $7.4 million registered members, up about 1 million members again last year. The combination of improved operations and<br>smarter marketing added up to a positive same-store top line sales of 2.7% in Q4, exceeding our expectations, particularly in a higher-than-anticipated<br>53rd week.<br>
As the first major step in changing our labor model and controlling mounting costs, our restaurant team successfully implemented Maestro in Q4,<br>over-delivering on controls and leveraging the top line growth. This resulted in labor at 34.1% for the quarter, down 100 basis points versus prior<br>year. This is the level of executional precision and collective effort that we will need moving forward to successfully implement other service model<br>solutions that work for our guests, our team members and our shareholders.<br>
We continue to promote Everyday Value via our $6.99 Tavern Double menu, which, of course, is always served with your choice of bottomless sides,<br>though I don't know why anyone would go beyond the fries, which moved to 14% menu mix by year end. We made a choice thoughtfully, informed<br>by research in Q4 2015 to extend the Tavern menu to regain our edge on value. As you can see, we made have progress. Best in value equal tops<br>and likelihood to recommend, equal best-in-class traffic growth. We will not cede leadership on this measure. We will continue to drive affordable<br>abundance as a key differentiator.<br>
In sum, 2017 set us up to maximize profitability via further productivity improvement while continuing to build same-store sales and traffic, primarily<br>through off-premise channels. We know we must improve returns to earn the right to grow again. We do not necessarily believe that the traditional<br>unit prototype is the best means through which to grow in the future, which is why we pause unit development beginning in 2019.<br>
Full service, as we have always defined it, likely won't hunt in the changing cost and operating environment ahead. We are actively exploring new<br>ways for guests to experience Red Robin, and we'll be ready to invest to capitalize on new opportunities if and when they are proven.<br>
To ensure we have sufficient resources to focus on that new future while also delivering on our in-year commitment, our leadership team came<br>together recently to reset the organization, streamlining home office and field structure to free up resources to fuel dedicated transformation<br>activities and reduce our committed expenses by over $14 million year-over-year. Organizational resets like this are never easy but they are critical.<br>Structure must follow strategy. We reset ours to be more nimble going forward. We've also chosen to invest about half of the projected 2018 tax<br>savings to accelerate several initiatives, which require one-time use of outside innovation resources.<br>

<A name=552></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, RRGB - Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call<br>
So 2018 is shaping up to be a year of maximizing what we have already put in place and creating and piloting 4-wall transformations for the<br>immediate future. We are committed to delivering positive traffic again this year and continuing to outperform our category. We are committed<br>to aggressively growing our off-premise business. We will measure ourselves against the best-in-class in our business, not just casual dining, on<br>everything from team member engagement, to guest satisfaction, to traffic growth. And we will set ourselves up for the model changes needed<br>that will allow us to grow again in the future.<br>
With that, let's all turn to Guy for the details on Q4 2017 year-end and our 2018 outlook, or as we know it around here, the annual Guydance.<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Thank you, Denny, and good afternoon, everyone. As I walk you through the highlights of our financial results for the fourth quarter, please note<br>that the numbers I present are on a recurring basis, excluding special items.<br>
As Denny outlined, the fourth quarter of 2017 extended Red Robin's run of significant traffic and sales outperformance versus the casual dining<br>industry, outperforming our peers by 360 basis points. We have also continued to expand on our 2-year outperformance versus our casual dining<br>peers, now tracking at 580 basis points as measured by Black Box.<br>
You may also recall that last quarter, we introduced that we have developed an additional benchmark that compares us to top quartile best-in-class<br>competitors for the entire industry, not just casual dining. For Q4, we outperformed this group as well, generating a positive traffic gap of 100 basis<br>points. Congratulations to our operations, marketing and culinary teams for continuing to deliver significantly differentiated performance.<br>
However, as we have said for several quarters, relative outperformance is not enough. We strive to be a great business, not just a better restaurant<br>business. And the fourth quarter of 2017 demonstrated the start of the kind of results up and down the P&amp;L that will help us deliver on that promise.<br>As we have commented on in past quarters, a great deal of foundational work has been put in place over the past 2 years, and we are now seeing<br>the results from the differentiated thinking we brought to the industry and the hard work on those new ideas.<br>
For the full year 2017, Red Robin made notable progress in a number of areas. Our team members turned negative comp sales to positive. Our<br>team members delivered full year positive traffic, one of only a very small number of restaurant industry players to do so. Our team members<br>reversed margin declines from earlier in the year to margin improvements at the end of the year. Our team members dramatically improved<br>restaurant productivity and are poised to do so again in 2018. And our team members delivered the significant positive cash flow necessary for a<br>healthy and stable business.<br>
Yet to sustain the strong performance in the current casual dining environment, we need to introduce the type of changes necessary to make our<br>business truly successful. We are making, and will continue to make, the important choices around business investments, and we will need to<br>innovate in a way that allows us to fully capitalize on the differentiated position that Red Robin holds with the restaurant consumer.<br>
These actions support our intention to first return to absolute and consistent earnings growth, and then put ourselves into a position to allow us<br>to provide growth and returns that one associates with high-performing organizations.<br>
Now to the specific results, keeping in mind that in 2017, we featured a 53rd week versus 52 weeks in 2016. Q4 total company revenues increased<br>17.5% to $342.4 million, up from $291.5 million a year ago, driven primarily by the 53rd week, strong comp sales and new restaurant openings.<br>Comparable restaurant sales grew 2.7%, driven by a 1.9% increase in guest traffic and a 0.8% in average guest check. Mix decreased to 1.8%,<br>primarily driven by heavier guest usage of our Tavern and Value menu. Overall price, after considering the impact of discounting, increased 2.6%<br>in the quarter. This higher level of price was due to a change in timing for the price increases compared to a year ago as we took the price increase<br>in October versus January.<br>
We would expect to be at our expected price level of 0% to 1% starting this quarter and moving forward, consistent with our focus on driving traffic<br>through greater affordability for our guests. Fourth quarter restaurant level operating margin was 20.5%, up 70 basis points versus a year ago,<br>driven by the following factors: Cost of sales increased 90 basis points to 23.7%, driven primarily by higher cost of steak fries and higher ground<br>

beef costs. As Denny mentioned, restaurant labor cost decreased 100 basis points to 34.1%, driven by decreases in management labor costs,<br>improved hourly labor productivity and health insurance cost, partially offset by an increase in restaurant manager bonus cost. The Maestro program<br>reached full implementation in Q4 and our restaurant managers delivered on all targets related to the program.<br>
Earlier this year, we made significant investments to improve the payout levels of our restaurant manager incentive programs. These improved<br>payouts were predicated on a successful pivot to improve labor productivity and to generate better restaurant level economics while driving<br>improved comp sales. We're happy to say that these changes, combined with improved operating results, produced full year 2017 restaurant<br>manager bonus payouts that were nearly $8 million higher than in 2016.<br>
Other operating cost decreased 50 basis points to 13.2%, primarily due to decreases in repair and maintenance costs and lower utilities, offset<br>partially by higher third-party delivery costs and restaurant technology expenses. Occupancy cost decreased 20 basis points due to lower real<br>estate taxes.<br>
General and administrative expense improved by 10 basis points to 6.4%, due primarily to sales leverage and despite an increase of $3.3 million in<br>performance-based compensation versus a year ago. Selling expenses were up 60 basis points as a percent of revenue to 4.5% due to increases in<br>local marketing spend, national media spend and higher gift card costs. This quarter features a change in how we classify selling expense with all<br>marketing activities, including both national and local marketing and media expenses, now all represented in this line. The local marketing cost<br>moved out of the other operating expense line. We believe this change, which is reflected for both this year and last year in the numbers, will<br>provide better transparency to the true marketing expense and activity for the organization moving forward.<br>
Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $35.8 million, up approximately 22.5% versus a year ago, aided by the 53rd week, higher comp sales and improved margin.<br>Depreciation and amortization improved by 120 basis points to 6.4%. Net interest expense and other was $2.5 million, an increase of $500,000<br>versus the prior year, driven by higher interest rates on a revolving credit facility. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 7.2% compared to 8% a<br>year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.78 as compared to $0.35 in the fourth quarter of 2016. And the 53rd week generated $29.8<br>million in restaurant revenue, contributed approximately $4.7 million EBITDA, $4.1 million in net income and $0.39 in diluted earnings per share.<br>
During the quarter, we recognized an impairment charge of $5.3 million related to 9 existing restaurant locations. And in addition, due to the U.S.<br>government's enaction of comprehensive tax legislation, the company recorded a decrease related to our deferred tax liabilities, which provided<br>a onetime tax benefit of $2.8 million.<br>
Now for the balance sheet. We invested $22.5 million in CapEx in the fourth quarter, primarily related to restaurant maintenance capital, investment<br>in technology projects and new restaurant openings. We ended the quarter with $17.7 million in cash, up $6 million versus where we ended 2016,<br>and finished the quarter with a lease adjusted leverage ratio of 4.04x. We paid down a total of $70 million of debt in 2017, and our leverage ratio<br>has improved a little more than a quarter turn, allowing us to materially derisk the business. We continue to press forward towards our ultimate<br>goal of maintaining a lease adjusted leverage ratio of 3x.<br>
As we move into 2018, I wanted to share with you our expectations for the coming year. And again let me point out that our 2018 fiscal year will<br>return to its normal 52 weeks versus the 53 weeks this past year. The company expects 2018 revenues to range between a decline of 50 basis points<br>and an increase of 50 basis points as compared to the 53-week 2017 revenue total. This will include a decline in operating weeks of about 1%.<br>Comp restaurant sales are projected to grow between 50 basis points and 150 basis points.<br>
Cost of sales is projected to increase from 50 to 100 basis points versus a year ago due to higher steak fry cost and a return to a moderately inflationary<br>commodity environment. At the end of 2017, approximately 60% of our 2018 food cost spend was contracted.<br>
Restaurant labor costs are projected between an increase of 25 basis points and a decrease of 25 basis points, driven by minimum wage increases<br>in more highly penetrated markets and restaurant manager bonus as planned at target levels, offset by the effects of improvements in labor<br>productivity.<br>

<A name=554></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, RRGB - Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call<br>
Other operating expenses are expected to be flat to down 50 basis points, due primarily to lower repair and maintenance costs. Depreciation<br>expense is projected to be approximately $95 million.<br>
G&amp;A expense is projected to be $85 million to $90 million. This includes a $3 million year-over-year increase to reset bonus to target levels. In<br>addition, Denny mentioned earlier that we recently reset the organization to streamline our home office and field structure and free up resources<br>still out for reinvestment. About $10 million of those savings will be realized in the G&amp;A line, offset partially by investment in the transformational<br>and technology projects that will lay the foundation for the future growth models for Red Robin.<br>
Selling expense, which includes both national and local marketing activities, is expected to be up slightly as a percent of restaurant revenues, and<br>preopening expense is estimated to be approximately $3 million due to fewer new restaurant openings. Our income tax rate is projected to range<br>between 0% and 5% for 2018. As Denny outlined, we expect to invest some of the tax savings in 2018 to accelerate initiatives to enhance the guest<br>experience, put technology in our team members' hands to improve their work experience and further improve productivity, and to identify the<br>next growth models for Red Robin as mentioned earlier.<br>
Earnings per diluted share is projected to range from $2.40 to $2.80 which represents an increase of 14% to 33% versus a year ago when normalizing<br>2017 for the 53rd week. We expect Q1 earnings per diluted share between $0.60 and $0.80, reflecting both a challenging start to 2018 for the<br>industry and the loss of 1 high-volume revenue week versus a year ago due, again, to the 53rd week.<br>
Overall CapEx is projected to be between $65 million and $75 million as we shift capital investment from lower return new unit opening to higher<br>return restaurant technology and kitchen investments that will increase revenue and improve productivity. We expect to open 3 to 5 new Red<br>Robin restaurants in 2018, net of closures, and we expect to use excess free cash flow after CapEx to pay down outstanding debt.<br>
While we can look back on 2017 as a year of significant transition, what is most important was the work our team members did to put the company<br>in a position to both further improve our existing business and to aggressively and rapidly reinvent Red Robin for future growth. Our traffic numbers<br>are at the top of the industry. Our NPS scores are reaching record levels. Our off-premise growth is exceeding our expectations. Our restaurant<br>execution is best-in-class. And we are making significant progress on a new and different service model for this space.<br>
Before I close, let me once again congratulate our operators and our marketing team for another quarter of differentiated performance. We've<br>taken great care of our guests and our team members, and have, again, been good stewards of our company resources, all while absorbing significant<br>change to the service model. We will continue to prioritize our capital and operating investments based on the incremental returns on capital that<br>these investments will create. Whether these priorities drive sales, improve margins, reduce expenses, generate EBITDA or distribute capital to<br>shareholders, the overriding filter will be the expected return of that incremental capital or an improved return on capital already invested, as it is<br>the focus on overall returns that is most highly correlated to overall improvements in total shareholder return.<br>
With that, I'll turn the call back to Denny for a few final comments before we take your questions.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Thank you, Guy. In closing, I'd like to give a hearty shout out and a Red Robin YUMMM to our entire team, here in the home office and in the field,<br>for stepping up to redefine our business and lead us through the critical changes we've made. We recently hosted all our general managers and<br>regional operations directors from the U.S. and Canada as well as many of our franchisees and business partners at our annual leadership conference,<br>where we laid out the case for urgent change. The energy and commitment to continue to excel and separate ourselves from the casual dining<br>category was palpable. Our collective goal is to ensure Red Robin is here to serve generations to come. We are, and will be, the model of resilience.<br>Accepting realities, staying strong and adopting a growth mindset informed by new ways of being for the future. Now let's take some questions.<br>

<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Alex Slagle from Jefferies.<br>
<b>Alexander Russell Slagle</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
A question on your 4Q performance. I just want to kind of get a feel for how big the Tavern menu was in terms of being a driver versus off-premise<br>and other drivers, and then how far you're willing to let that Tavern Double menu mix grow as you sort of balance the traffic with loyalty metrics<br>with the lighter check that comes with that.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, we think Everyday Value is a place that we can win long term, Alex, so I'm less concerned with absolutely where the mix goes. As we said, for<br>FY '17, I think we ended up about 430 basis points year-over-year compared to the prior year on Tavern mix. We made that choice deliberately,<br>and continue to kind of focus on that. It's hard to parse the difference between Everyday Value as it shows up in off-premise versus dine-in, but<br>there is no doubt that the off-premise occasion is the one that's growing the most rapidly. Is that helpful?<br>
<b>Alexander Russell Slagle</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Yes, that is. And then maybe if you could provide some color on the dine-in trends that you've seen and kind of where you see that heading into<br>'18?<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
They were better in Q4 than what we've seen in Q3. So certainly, again, not being certain which one is the trend and which is the up and down<br>with regards to dine-in. So we were off about 0.5 point in dine-in traffic, more than offset by, obviously, our growth in on-premise. And for the first<br>time, honestly, we saw our mall locations not do as well, our in-line and mall locations not do as well as we had in the prior years. So certainly, that<br>continues to be a relative drag on our business. So again, we've only got about 17% of our locations that are in that group.<br>
<b>Alexander Russell Slagle</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Great. And one final question, just on the first quarter, I don't know if you altered your media spend at all with the Winter Olympics. I recall a couple<br>years back, you had sort of moved that around a little bit.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes, we did some things around messaging a few years ago. And we continue to try to make sure that we're trying to drive our guests in more for<br>lunch. I'm glad the Olympics only come once every 4 years. Let's put it that way. Viewership is down, but, I don't know.<br>

<A name=556></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, RRGB - Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
Maybe just first a clarification. I think in the prepared remarks, Denny, you had said you are generally pleased with trends to start the year, but Guy,<br>you were highlighting part of the reason why you gave the first quarter earnings guidance is because of a challenging start for the industry. I guess<br>I'm trying to reconcile those 2 comments.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
You filled in a blank I didn't fill in. I said we are generally pleased with the trend's coming out of last year. I did not say in this year.<br>
<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
Got it. Understood.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
So yes. Greg, you filled in a sentence I didn't state.<br>
<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
No, I hear -- I guess I'm hearing -- I may be hearing things.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
We don't comment -- yes, it's okay. I understand because I know, some have, we don't comment in quarter where -- our continued commitment<br>is to outperform the set, and we want to do that.<br>
<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
Understood. And then just how do you think about the average check going forward? I mean clearly mix continues to be about 150, 200 basis point<br>drag, and now you're starting to take more pricing against that. Do you expect mix to start to turn more or start to contribute sort of a meaningful<br>portion of the comps as you move into '18?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes, Greg, on the pricing, we had the unique circumstance this quarter where an annual price increase that we may typically take in January, we<br>instead took in October this year. So what you had in the fourth quarter was the benefit of the pricing we took last January, plus what we took in<br>October. That will correct itself here in Q1. We won't be taking price this January, we just took it early. And so we would expect our pricing to be<br>flat to up 1% as a rule of thumb going forward. So we're definitely not pricing to try and offset the mix. In terms of the -- what we think about PPA<br>and mix going forward, if the guests desire and the way we can drive value, as Denny said, is to allow the Tavern mix to extend, I think we're okay<br>with that. I think as we talked about, affordability and values are very important component for us. So we're not necessarily trying to push hard to<br>drive our PPA higher. We want to make sure we maintain affordability for the guest. And of course, the best way to do that is to do the work in<br>fixing the fundamental business model so we can continue to offer that profitably.<br>

<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
Got it. And then maybe one last question. I think you talked about excess free cash -- excess cash flow going to paying down debt. When do you<br>start buying back stock? Is that towards the latter half of '18? Or is that more of a '19 focus?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes, our belief, Greg, is that we'll reach the point probably in early 2019, where we'll feel comfortable to blend both share repurchase and debt<br>repayment. We don't have to get all the way down to our 3x goal before we start doing that, but we're not yet at the point, we believe, in 2018<br>where we think we're ready to reintroduce the share repurchase.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll go next to Peter Saleh from BTIG.<br>
<b>Peter Mokhlis Saleh</b> - BTIG, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Restaurant Analyst<br>
Denny, can you guys just go over the rationale behind the change and the timing of pricing? Why did you take the pricing earlier versus your<br>traditional timing?<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Honestly, we had some menu changes we were making, and it was a way to save some money on having to reprint menus. So candidly, it was a<br>cost avoidance for us.<br>
<b>Peter Mokhlis Saleh</b> - BTIG, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Restaurant Analyst<br>
Okay. Fair enough. And then on the investments that you're planning to make this year, can you give us a sense of the cadence? Will it hit more in<br>one quarter than in others? How do you spread it out throughout the year? I know it just makes a pretty sizable difference in the model as we model<br>it out.<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes. The new unit spend will be skewed more towards the front of the year. Peter, you'll recall that when we decided to pause the traditional unit<br>growth, those that were already, kind of, in the pipeline we had to continue on with. And we were able to stop those that were off further into the<br>future. So the new unit spend will more consistently -- or most of it will occur in the front half of the year. In terms of the balance of the investment,<br>probably a little skewed to the front half, but generally, pretty consistent over the entire year.<br>
<b>Peter Mokhlis Saleh</b> - BTIG, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Restaurant Analyst<br>
Okay. And then just on the loss of the -- the 1-week loss in the -- and the first quarter that you said was a high-volume week, can you give us a sense<br>of maybe how much in EPS that may have impacted? Or maybe how much that benefited last year and didn't impact this year?<br>

<A name=558></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, RRGB - Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Well, so for example, we did give some detail in the prepared comments. And in the release, Peter, you'll see on what the 53rd week benefited us<br>in the fourth quarter. It was $0.39 of EPS. As we look to Q1, one of the issues, as you consider modeling, is while there -- it's a 16-week quarter this<br>year as it was last year. The first 2 weeks of the quarter last year were the week after Christmas and the week after New Year's which are 2 of your<br>highest volume weeks in the entire calendar year. This year, of course, because of the 53rd week, took us through to the end of the calendar year.<br>This year's first quarter will only have the week after New Year's in it. So when you're modeling, if you just use last year's Q1 base, you're probably<br>overstating the absolute benefit as we move now into 2018.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll go next to Will Slabaugh from Stephens Inc.<br>
<b>Hugh Gordon Gooding</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - Research Associate<br>
This is actually Hugh on for Will today. My first question is around off-premise, and specifically, what percent of restaurants are currently offering<br>delivery, and if you could just give us some more color around the incrementality or profitability impact that you're seeing from delivery?<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes. So about 240 of our locations or roughly half of our corporate locations have 1 or more tablets and partners in delivery. We continue to see it<br>as highly incremental. There seems to be a unique guest going to those sites, and are open to the possibility of adding more of this year. We'll see<br>how it goes. But as it stands, it's grown from, I guess, we've added about 10 more so far this year, but about 240 as of right now.<br>
<b>Hugh Gordon Gooding</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - Research Associate<br>
Okay. That's great. And we've heard on other calls about concepts seeing a recovery in consumer spending. Are you all seeing the same thing, and<br>if you noticed any geographical pockets to note there especially strong or soft?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Well, Hugh, we won't comment on what, if anything, we've seen in the first quarter. Although all of you are looking at the NAP and Black Box metrics<br>to kind of get a sense of how those things are impacting the restaurant industry. And of course, there's some speculation as to what the changes<br>in the tax legislation will mean for individuals moving forward. But through that, we wouldn't want to speculate how that's impacting us. In terms<br>of geographies, we certainly look at those, and in the markets where we're most penetrated, Pacific Northwest, West Coast, Mountain states, we<br>did very well. Some of our highest gaps to Black Box were in those states. The states, where we perhaps had a gap that wasn't quite as large are<br>the states where we're much less penetrated, which I think potentially does say something to you as well. That where we can be penetrated and<br>well known and can leverage our local marketing ability, we're able to drive exceedingly higher gaps to the rest of the industry in sales and traffic.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes, because we in the fourth quarter, we outperformed 10 -- in 10 out of 11 of the regions on traffic and 8 out of 11 on sales. So outperformance<br>is where we're focused.<br>

<b>Stephen Anderson</b> - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division - Senior VP &amp; Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
So saw the strong performance coming out of Q4. I mean, starting with the mix coming from the Tavern program by -- see a dramatic pull back<br>from Q4 and basically over the full year we see not much incremental improvement from 2017. And what do you see coming out of that? I mean,<br>do you factor in any kind of a pull-back in terms of traffic?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
No, other than what I've mentioned, Stephen, is that the first quarters are a little bit of apples and oranges to try and compare because we lose<br>one of those high volume weeks. What we're lapping to is the factor for the industry as a whole. January was a pretty strong period, last year for<br>the industry, and then it weakened again in February and March. But no, I don't think there's anything that would cause us to think differently<br>about the factors that are impacting the consumer from the third, fourth quarter into the first.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll go to Howard Penney from Hedgeye.<br>
<b>Howard W. Penney</b> - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC - MD<br>
I have 2 questions. First, it feels like the phrase, alternative service style, is new but it's not new. I understand you were looking at sort of different<br>ways of growing the business. But I'm just curious if there's anything new in your thinking along those lines? I know you're testing a store, but it<br>just feels like you're looking at something new. And then the second question, more specifically, Guy, is the delta in returns from a low margin unit<br>to high margin or a high return -- or a low return unit to a high return, other investments into improving your store performance? I'm just curious<br>of what the difference in the returns are, if you've seen those.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes, Howard. I mean, yes, alternative service models, and I put an S on the end of that, so I think what you're referring to is the 1 location that we've<br>opened that's currently just delivery and third-party carry-out or third-party delivery and self-delivery out of our Chicago location. We're continuing<br>to look at ways that we can address the rising labor costs and find new ways in our existing 4-walls to help the guest. And so you'll hear a lot of<br>that. That's what we consider transformation. And we've got a lot to focus on that right now, a number of different things we're looking at. But as<br>we bring those forward, expand them beyond very initial pilots, we'll share our results at that time.<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes, and maybe just to add to that before I answer your other question, Howard, we were leaning heavily into the technology investment. We're<br>in the process of expanding the technology capacity in our current restaurants. We're doing an upgrade to our current point-of-sale software and<br>our food cost management system. We're putting catering software in our restaurants. We're going to put technology in the hands of our servers<br>to improve their productivity, improve the guest experience. So we feel like improving those 4-wall economics, which does lead into your second<br>question, is an important focus of ours. Rather than building new 4 walls, we need to make the 4 walls that we've got operate much better. In terms<br>of the delta between returns, I mean, I don't know that I'd want to get into the specifics, but we've got units, as you might imagine, that do north<br>of 6 million in volume on an annual basis and we've got some that do 2 million. And so as you can imagine, the return profile is dramatically different<br>between those 2. As we think about refranchising the system, those factors enter in to our equation as we think about would we earn a better<br>return with those models being franchised as opposed to being company-owned. Which is why we set the goals around increasing our franchise<br>mix. And of course, any of these initiatives we're working on to drive comp sales or invest in technology and improve labor productivity will -- sort<br>of will be the tide that lifts all the boats in the system. And so that's where we're focused on right now, improve the 4-wall economics. Doing better<br>

with the investments that you've already made is always going to provide a better return than trying to search for new ideas to try and drive those<br>returns as we move forward.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
And improve those economics without making trade-offs to the guest experience. That's why it's challenging.<br>

<b>Howard W. Penney</b> - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC - MD<br>
Can I get you to potentially tier the investment that you're making by returns? Or -- what's the most -- what's the highest return...<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
That's how we do it internally, Howard. We look at the course of ideas that we have, and the ones that generate the highest return are the ones<br>that rise to the top of the ladder. And those could be and are, in fact -- and I know you've been in our kitchens and you've seen them, some very<br>simple kitchen investments that may not be high dollar amounts but provide great returns. But that's exactly how we do it. It's stack-ranked to<br>returns and make the investments in that order.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll go next to Robert Mollins from Wells Fargo.<br>
<b>Robert Michael Mollins</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
First question. Can you guys talk about curbside pickup is performing versus delivery? And are you guys seeing a difference in the average check<br>between the 2?<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Curbside is actually not -- again, curbside, we've only been able to implement in a percentage of our locations. And I'm looking for somebody to<br>tell me exactly the number, but yes, we're limited by, I want to say maybe 60%. Curbside uptake, I think, is not as high as perhaps we had expected<br>initially. Delivery is definitely the growing category. Third-party delivery is huge and growing rapidly. And for the fact that it's only in about half of<br>our locations, it's over-representing right now in terms of growth. In terms of difference in check average, really not much difference in check<br>average. The biggest challenge with anything in off-premise is the loss of the beverage sale, but the guest does seem to get more food even though<br>the average eaters per check is lower. So they embark, they take advantage of getting more food but don't get the beverage. But curbside has not<br>been the dramatic growth piece that we expected. A lot of folks are still walking in. We're seeing about equal balance between online and call-center<br>orders, and continue to see one of the largest components is folks just walking in to the restaurant, which is what we've been doing for years.<br>

I just want to say that about -- of the overall price increase for the year, I want to say about 60% of it was in the earlier price increase and about 40%<br>of it in the October price increase.<br>
<b>Brian Michael Vaccaro</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - VP<br>
Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then on the food cost side, you said modest inflation. Could you provide some more color on the puts and takes<br>within that line, what you're expecting in terms of ground beef and other moving pieces?<br>

<A name=562></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, RRGB - Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes. Ground beef, we're expecting moderate inflation, Brian. And then steak fries is the other one that we called out as being fairly significant. Those<br>are the 2 primary drivers of the food cost inflation that we're expecting for the year. No other real unique issues to point out that are material.<br>
<b>Brian Michael Vaccaro</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - VP<br>
Okay. And then on the labor productivity initiatives. I wanted to ask about just how the teams have adjusted to removing the bussers? And has<br>that initiative now been fully rolled out to the system?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
So we didn't -- aren't commenting specifically about what's been done in quarter, Brian, but the Maestro, as I mentioned on my comment, the<br>Maestro had gone well. All the targets were hit. So I think there's a lot of momentum coming off of that. And we did -- we made those changes in<br>a quarter, where our comp sales and our traffic were very strong. So I think that's building confidence in our operators that we can make these<br>kinds of changes, and that we're making them with an eye towards making sure that the guest experience is at least as good, and in many cases,<br>hopefully better than what we saw before. And getting momentum on these kinds of changes and seeing that they can work and be a positive for<br>the guest experience is helpful for us to get other changes done in the future. The team service approach is obviously an important one for us to<br>get the year started but we have other things in the queue as well.<br>
<b>Brian Michael Vaccaro</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - VP<br>
Okay, so just to be clear, the team service changes though, they are going in during the first quarter as we speak?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes, again, we don't want to give any of the specifics, Brian. But we are making labor changes, we have, as of the start of the year. We're seeing<br>productivity improvements continue.<br>
<b>Brian Michael Vaccaro</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - VP<br>
Okay. And then just one last one on that. Can you quantify, as you think about your labor outlook for 2018, can you quantify the labor savings<br>between the Maestro and other initiatives that are embedded in that guidance? Or have you just embedded the Maestro at this point and there<br>could be potentially more to come? Can you give us some perspective there?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Oh, no, we have other changes embedded in the guidance because the Maestro is worth about $8 million, you will recall, Brian, and we started<br>that in the fourth quarter. So call it 3 quarters of that benefit or $6 million of the improvement will come from Maestro. And for us to offset<br>mid-single-digit inflation on our labor basket, we obviously need a lot more than the Maestro program in order to get to that down 25 to up 25 on<br>labor as a percent of revenues. So we are definitely assuming some other changes in that guidance.<br>
<b>Brian Michael Vaccaro</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - VP<br>
Technology [of] your guidance.<br>

<A name=563></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, RRGB - Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll take our next question from Gregory Francfort from Bank of America.<br>
<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
I just had an extra question. Just in terms of the quantification of the shift in the week. I think from what you've given us, the extra week from 2017,<br>there's probably 15% to 20% higher than a normal week, which if I do the math, sort of suggests the $5 million move from the first quarter to the<br>fourth quarter. And so we should be like removing $5 million from the first quarter and then adding that on to the fourth quarter. Is that roughly<br>the right way we should be thinking about kind of the math there?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes. I think that's roughly correct, Greg. That if you take into account how much higher the 53rd week is than a typical week, and obviously you<br>have to think about it in a typical Q1 week, that's probably a reasonable assumption as to how you should move the dollars around.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll go next to Will Slabaugh from Stephens Inc.<br>
<b>William Everett Slabaugh</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Just wanted to do a quick follow up on the tax rate if I could. On the 0% to 5% guide, I wanted to make sure that was a sort of a sustainable number<br>as we think about '18 into '19. Is that a number we can count on kind of going forward? Is there anything to point out in '18 that might be a little<br>bit different than what we might expect in future years?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
No, I don't think so, other than just the normal factor in our industry, Will. As earnings rise, tax rate tends to rise, and as earnings go down, tax rate<br>goes down. But assuming the numbers that we guided to, that's a reasonable rate to assume going forward.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Denny Post for any closing remarks.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
That's it. We thank you all for your interest today, and look forward to talking to you individually on the follow-ups. Take care.<br>

<A name=567></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, RRGB - Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>PRESENTATION SUMMARY</b><br>
<b>I. 4Q17 REVIEW (D.P.)</b><br>
<b>A. Highlights:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Outlook for the year ahead is already 13% behind Co.<br><b>2. </b>Last qtr., stated about commitment to leverage brand and organizational strengths to stay strong in near term while making<br>
necessary changes to achieve continued long-term success.<br>
<b>a. </b>Made progress.<br>
<b>3. </b>Closed 2017 stronger than expected.<br>
<b>a. </b>Believes Co. has fundamentals in place to carry RRGB through 2018.<br>
<b>4. </b>Closed books on full-year with positive traffic up 40 BP.<br>
<b>a. </b>300-points-plus ahead of casual dining category, which was down for the year according to Black Box.<br><b>b. </b>This annual outperformance was best in over five years.<br>
<b>c. </b>4Q17 marked six quarters in a row where Co. has outpaced competition and taken share.<br>
<b>d. </b>Considers this traffic outperformance even more meaningful today, as consumers have more options than ever to choose<br>
from.<br>
<b>e. </b>Believes winners in this category over time will be defined by their ability to continually connect with guests in way they<br>
prefer with strong brand that can bridge different occasions and modes of access.<br>
<b>i. </b>Last year performance benefited from multi-generational brand relevance and agility to meet different guest needs<br>
while making changes to operating model that benefit middle of P&amp;L.<br>
<b>5. </b>Operators continued to step-up their game in on-premise dining service as measured by Net Promoter Score (NPS), taking<br>
dramatic improvements they made in 2016 even higher to avg. NPS of over 70, with under 7% detractors for 2017, not<br>missing a beat with guest while dropping expediter role of what Co. calls Maestro.<br>
<b>a. </b>They accomplished this while significantly growing off-premise business via carry out, third-party delivery and catering,<br>
which combined were up 45% YoverY to 8.3% mix in 4Q.<br>
<b>b. </b>[Misses] good start toward goal of mixing on par with others in low-to-mid teens.<br>
<b>6. </b>Marketing team continued to fine-tune messaging and media spending, targeting markets where Co. has best unit penetration<br>
with incremental corporate investment.<br>
<b>a. </b>They continued to smartly segment and leverage Co.'s best-in-class royalty program, which is now in its eighth year with<br>
7.4m registered members, up about 1m members again last year.<br>
<b>7. </b>Combination of improved operations and smarter marketing added up to positive same-store topline sales of 2.7%.<br>
<b>a. </b>Exceeded expectations, particularly in higher-than-anticipated 53rd week.<br>
<b>8. </b>As first major step in changing labor model and controlling [Mountain] costs, restaurant teams successfully implemented<br>
Maestro, over delivering on control and leveraging topline growth.<br>
<b>a. </b>This resulted in labor at 34.1%; down 100 BP YoverY.<br><b>b. </b>This is level of executional precession and collective effort that Co. will need moving forward to successfully implement<br>
other service model solutions that work for guests, team members and shareholders.<br>
<b>9. </b>Continued to promote Every Day Value via $6.99 Tavern Double menu; moved to 14% menu mix by year-end.<br>
<b>a. </b>Made choice thoughtfully, informed by research in 4Q15 to expand Tavern menu to regain edge on value.<br>
<b>i. </b>Made progress.<br>
<b>b. </b>Will not see leadership on this measure.<br>
<b>c. </b>Will continue to drive affordable abundance as key differentiator.<br>
<b>10. </b>2017 set Co. up to maximize profitability via further productivity improvements while continuing to build same-store sales<br>
and traffic, primarily through off-premise channels.<br>
<b>11. </b>Co. knows it must improve returns to earn right to grow again.<br>
<b>a. </b>Does not necessarily believe that traditional unit prototype is best means through which to grow in future, which is why<br>
Co. paused unit development beginning in 2019.<br>
<b>12. </b>Full service, as Co. has always defined it, likely won't [hunt] in changing cost and operating environment ahead.<br>

<b>i. </b>53rd week.<br>
<b>ii. </b>Strong comp sales.<br>
<b>iii. </b>New restaurant openings.<br>
<b>3. </b>Comparable restaurant sales grew 2.7%, driven by:<br>
<b>a. </b>1.9% increase in guest traffic.<br><b>b. </b>0.8% in avg. guest check.<br>
<b>4. </b>Mix decreased 1.8%, primarily driven by heavier guest usage of Tavern value menu.<br><b>5. </b>Overall price, after considering impact of discounting, increased 2.6%.<br>
<b>a. </b>Higher level of price was due to change in timing for price increase vs. a year ago, as Co. took price increase in Oct. vs. Jan.<br><b>b. </b>Would expect to be at expected price level of 0-1% starting this qtr. and moving forward, consistent with focus on driving<br>

<b>6. </b>Restaurant-level operating margin 20.5%; up 70 BP YoverY driven by:<br>
<b>a. </b>Cost of sales 23.7%, increased 90 BP, driven primarily by higher [cost of cig] price and higher ground beef costs.<br><b>b. </b>Restaurant labor costs 34.1%, decreased 100 BP, driven by decreases in management labor costs, improved hourly labor<br>
productivity and health insurance costs, partially offset by increase in restaurant manager bonus costs.<br>

<b>a. </b>Restaurant managers delivered on all targets related to the program.<br>
<b>8. </b>Earlier this year, made significant investments to improve payout levels of restaurant manager incentive programs.<br>

that were nearly $8m higher than in 2016.<br>
<b>D. Key Metrics:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Other operating costs 13.2%.<br>
<b>a. </b>Decreased 50 BP, primarily due to decreases in repair and maintenance costs, and lower utilities, offset partially by higher<br>
third-party delivery costs and restaurant technology expenses.<br>
<b>2. </b>Occupancy costs decreased 20 BP due to lower real estate taxes.<br><b>3. </b>General and administrative expense 6.4%.<br>
<b>a. </b>Improved 10 BP, due primarily to sales leverage and despite an increase of $3.3m in performance-based compensation<br>
YoverY.<br>

marketing, and media expenses, now all represented in this line.<br>

<b>a. </b>Improved 120 BP.<br>
<b>7. </b>Net interest expense and other $2.5m.<br>
<b>a. </b>Up $500,000 YoverY, driven by higher interest rates on revolving credit facility.<br>

<b>9. </b>Adjusted diluted EPS $0.78 vs. 4Q16's $0.35.<br>

in diluted EPS.<br>
<b>11. </b>Recognized impairment charge of $5.3m related to nine existing restaurant locations.<br>
<b>a. </b>Due to US government's [enaction] of comprehensive tax legislation, recorded decrease related to deferred tax liabilities<br>

<b>A. Summary:</b><br>
<b>1. </b>Recently hosted all general managers and regional operations directors from US and Canada, and many franchisees and<br>
business partners at Annual Leadership Conference, where Co. laid out the case for urgent change.<br>
<b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Alex Slagle from Jefferies.<br>
<b>Alexander Russell Slagle</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
A question on your 4Q performance. I just want to kind of get a feel for how big the Tavern menu was in terms of being a driver<br>versus off-premise and other drivers, and then how far you're willing to let that Tavern Double menu mix grow as you sort of balance<br>the traffic with loyalty metrics with the lighter check that comes with that.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, we think Everyday Value is a place that we can win long term, Alex, so I'm less concerned with absolutely where the mix goes.<br>As we said, for FY '17, I think we ended up about 430 basis points year-over-year compared to the prior year on Tavern mix. We made<br>that choice deliberately, and continue to kind of focus on that. It's hard to parse the difference between Everyday Value as it shows<br>up in off-premise versus dine-in, but there is no doubt that the off-premise occasion is the one that's growing the most rapidly. Is<br>that helpful?<br>
<b>Alexander Russell Slagle</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Yes, that is. And then maybe if you could provide some color on the dine-in trends that you've seen and kind of where you see that<br>heading into '18?<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
They were better in Q4 than what we've seen in Q3. So certainly, again, not being certain which one is the trend and which is the up<br>and down with regards to dine-in. So we were off about 0.5 point in dine-in traffic, more than offset by, obviously, our growth in<br>on-premise. And for the first time, honestly, we saw our mall locations not do as well, our in-line and mall locations not do as well<br>as we had in the prior years. So certainly, that continues to be a relative drag on our business. So again, we've only got about 17%<br>of our locations that are in that group.<br>

<b>Alexander Russell Slagle</b> - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst<br>
Great. And one final question, just on the first quarter, I don't know if you altered your media spend at all with the Winter Olympics.<br>I recall a couple years back, you had sort of moved that around a little bit.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes, we did some things around messaging a few years ago. And we continue to try to make sure that we're trying to drive our guests<br>in more for lunch. I'm glad the Olympics only come once every 4 years. Let's put it that way. Viewership is down, but, I don't know.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And next we'll go to Gregory Francfort from Bank of America.<br>
<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
Maybe just first a clarification. I think in the prepared remarks, Denny, you had said you are generally pleased with trends to start<br>the year, but Guy, you were highlighting part of the reason why you gave the first quarter earnings guidance is because of a challenging<br>start for the industry. I guess I'm trying to reconcile those 2 comments.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
You filled in a blank I didn't fill in. I said we are generally pleased with the trend's coming out of last year. I did not say in this year.<br>
<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
Got it. Understood.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
So yes. Greg, you filled in a sentence I didn't state.<br>
<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
No, I hear -- I guess I'm hearing -- I may be hearing things.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
We don't comment -- yes, it's okay. I understand because I know, some have, we don't comment in quarter where -- our continued<br>commitment is to outperform the set, and we want to do that.<br>

<A name=573></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, RRGB - Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
Understood. And then just how do you think about the average check going forward? I mean clearly mix continues to be about 150,<br>200 basis point drag, and now you're starting to take more pricing against that. Do you expect mix to start to turn more or start to<br>contribute sort of a meaningful portion of the comps as you move into '18?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes, Greg, on the pricing, we had the unique circumstance this quarter where an annual price increase that we may typically take in<br>January, we instead took in October this year. So what you had in the fourth quarter was the benefit of the pricing we took last<br>January, plus what we took in October. That will correct itself here in Q1. We won't be taking price this January, we just took it early.<br>And so we would expect our pricing to be flat to up 1% as a rule of thumb going forward. So we're definitely not pricing to try and<br>offset the mix. In terms of the -- what we think about PPA and mix going forward, if the guests desire and the way we can drive value,<br>as Denny said, is to allow the Tavern mix to extend, I think we're okay with that. I think as we talked about, affordability and values<br>are very important component for us. So we're not necessarily trying to push hard to drive our PPA higher. We want to make sure<br>we maintain affordability for the guest. And of course, the best way to do that is to do the work in fixing the fundamental business<br>model so we can continue to offer that profitably.<br>
<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
Got it. And then maybe one last question. I think you talked about excess free cash -- excess cash flow going to paying down debt.<br>When do you start buying back stock? Is that towards the latter half of '18? Or is that more of a '19 focus?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes, our belief, Greg, is that we'll reach the point probably in early 2019, where we'll feel comfortable to blend both share repurchase<br>and debt repayment. We don't have to get all the way down to our 3x goal before we start doing that, but we're not yet at the point,<br>we believe, in 2018 where we think we're ready to reintroduce the share repurchase.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll go next to Peter Saleh from BTIG.<br>
<b>Peter Mokhlis Saleh</b> - BTIG, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Restaurant Analyst<br>
Denny, can you guys just go over the rationale behind the change and the timing of pricing? Why did you take the pricing earlier<br>versus your traditional timing?<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Honestly, we had some menu changes we were making, and it was a way to save some money on having to reprint menus. So<br>candidly, it was a cost avoidance for us.<br>

<A name=574></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, RRGB - Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Peter Mokhlis Saleh</b> - BTIG, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Restaurant Analyst<br>
Okay. Fair enough. And then on the investments that you're planning to make this year, can you give us a sense of the cadence? Will<br>it hit more in one quarter than in others? How do you spread it out throughout the year? I know it just makes a pretty sizable difference<br>in the model as we model it out.<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes. The new unit spend will be skewed more towards the front of the year. Peter, you'll recall that when we decided to pause the<br>traditional unit growth, those that were already, kind of, in the pipeline we had to continue on with. And we were able to stop those<br>that were off further into the future. So the new unit spend will more consistently -- or most of it will occur in the front half of the<br>year. In terms of the balance of the investment, probably a little skewed to the front half, but generally, pretty consistent over the<br>entire year.<br>
<b>Peter Mokhlis Saleh</b> - BTIG, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Restaurant Analyst<br>
Okay. And then just on the loss of the -- the 1-week loss in the -- and the first quarter that you said was a high-volume week, can you<br>give us a sense of maybe how much in EPS that may have impacted? Or maybe how much that benefited last year and didn't impact<br>this year?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Well, so for example, we did give some detail in the prepared comments. And in the release, Peter, you'll see on what the 53rd week<br>benefited us in the fourth quarter. It was $0.39 of EPS. As we look to Q1, one of the issues, as you consider modeling, is while there<br>-- it's a 16-week quarter this year as it was last year. The first 2 weeks of the quarter last year were the week after Christmas and the<br>week after New Year's which are 2 of your highest volume weeks in the entire calendar year. This year, of course, because of the 53rd<br>week, took us through to the end of the calendar year. This year's first quarter will only have the week after New Year's in it. So when<br>you're modeling, if you just use last year's Q1 base, you're probably overstating the absolute benefit as we move now into 2018.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll go next to Will Slabaugh from Stephens Inc.<br>
<b>Hugh Gordon Gooding</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - Research Associate<br>
This is actually Hugh on for Will today. My first question is around off-premise, and specifically, what percent of restaurants are<br>currently offering delivery, and if you could just give us some more color around the incrementality or profitability impact that you're<br>seeing from delivery?<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes. So about 240 of our locations or roughly half of our corporate locations have 1 or more tablets and partners in delivery. We<br>continue to see it as highly incremental. There seems to be a unique guest going to those sites, and are open to the possibility of<br>adding more of this year. We'll see how it goes. But as it stands, it's grown from, I guess, we've added about 10 more so far this year,<br>but about 240 as of right now.<br>

<A name=575></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, RRGB - Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Hugh Gordon Gooding</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - Research Associate<br>
Okay. That's great. And we've heard on other calls about concepts seeing a recovery in consumer spending. Are you all seeing the<br>same thing, and if you noticed any geographical pockets to note there especially strong or soft?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Well, Hugh, we won't comment on what, if anything, we've seen in the first quarter. Although all of you are looking at the NAP and<br>Black Box metrics to kind of get a sense of how those things are impacting the restaurant industry. And of course, there's some<br>speculation as to what the changes in the tax legislation will mean for individuals moving forward. But through that, we wouldn't<br>want to speculate how that's impacting us. In terms of geographies, we certainly look at those, and in the markets where we're most<br>penetrated, Pacific Northwest, West Coast, Mountain states, we did very well. Some of our highest gaps to Black Box were in those<br>states. The states, where we perhaps had a gap that wasn't quite as large are the states where we're much less penetrated, which I<br>think potentially does say something to you as well. That where we can be penetrated and well known and can leverage our local<br>marketing ability, we're able to drive exceedingly higher gaps to the rest of the industry in sales and traffic.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes, because we in the fourth quarter, we outperformed 10 -- in 10 out of 11 of the regions on traffic and 8 out of 11 on sales. So<br>outperformance is where we're focused.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And next we'll go to Stephen Anderson from the Maxim Group.<br>
<b>Stephen Anderson</b> - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division - Senior VP &amp; Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
So saw the strong performance coming out of Q4. I mean, starting with the mix coming from the Tavern program by -- see a dramatic<br>pull back from Q4 and basically over the full year we see not much incremental improvement from 2017. And what do you see<br>coming out of that? I mean, do you factor in any kind of a pull-back in terms of traffic?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
No, other than what I've mentioned, Stephen, is that the first quarters are a little bit of apples and oranges to try and compare because<br>we lose one of those high volume weeks. What we're lapping to is the factor for the industry as a whole. January was a pretty strong<br>period, last year for the industry, and then it weakened again in February and March. But no, I don't think there's anything that would<br>cause us to think differently about the factors that are impacting the consumer from the third, fourth quarter into the first.<br>

And we'll go to Howard Penney from Hedgeye.<br>

<A name=576></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, RRGB - Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Howard W. Penney</b> - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC - MD<br>
I have 2 questions. First, it feels like the phrase, alternative service style, is new but it's not new. I understand you were looking at<br>sort of different ways of growing the business. But I'm just curious if there's anything new in your thinking along those lines? I know<br>you're testing a store, but it just feels like you're looking at something new. And then the second question, more specifically, Guy,<br>is the delta in returns from a low margin unit to high margin or a high return -- or a low return unit to a high return, other investments<br>into improving your store performance? I'm just curious of what the difference in the returns are, if you've seen those.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes, Howard. I mean, yes, alternative service models, and I put an S on the end of that, so I think what you're referring to is the 1<br>location that we've opened that's currently just delivery and third-party carry-out or third-party delivery and self-delivery out of our<br>Chicago location. We're continuing to look at ways that we can address the rising labor costs and find new ways in our existing<br>4-walls to help the guest. And so you'll hear a lot of that. That's what we consider transformation. And we've got a lot to focus on<br>that right now, a number of different things we're looking at. But as we bring those forward, expand them beyond very initial pilots,<br>we'll share our results at that time.<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes, and maybe just to add to that before I answer your other question, Howard, we were leaning heavily into the technology<br>investment. We're in the process of expanding the technology capacity in our current restaurants. We're doing an upgrade to our<br>current point-of-sale software and our food cost management system. We're putting catering software in our restaurants. We're<br>going to put technology in the hands of our servers to improve their productivity, improve the guest experience. So we feel like<br>improving those 4-wall economics, which does lead into your second question, is an important focus of ours. Rather than building<br>new 4 walls, we need to make the 4 walls that we've got operate much better. In terms of the delta between returns, I mean, I don't<br>know that I'd want to get into the specifics, but we've got units, as you might imagine, that do north of 6 million in volume on an<br>annual basis and we've got some that do 2 million. And so as you can imagine, the return profile is dramatically different between<br>those 2. As we think about refranchising the system, those factors enter in to our equation as we think about would we earn a better<br>return with those models being franchised as opposed to being company-owned. Which is why we set the goals around increasing<br>our franchise mix. And of course, any of these initiatives we're working on to drive comp sales or invest in technology and improve<br>labor productivity will -- sort of will be the tide that lifts all the boats in the system. And so that's where we're focused on right now,<br>improve the 4-wall economics. Doing better with the investments that you've already made is always going to provide a better<br>return than trying to search for new ideas to try and drive those returns as we move forward.<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
And improve those economics without making trade-offs to the guest experience. That's why it's challenging.<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Absolutely.<br>

<b>Howard W. Penney</b> - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC - MD<br>
Can I get you to potentially tier the investment that you're making by returns? Or -- what's the most -- what's the highest return...<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
That's how we do it internally, Howard. We look at the course of ideas that we have, and the ones that generate the highest return<br>are the ones that rise to the top of the ladder. And those could be and are, in fact -- and I know you've been in our kitchens and<br>you've seen them, some very simple kitchen investments that may not be high dollar amounts but provide great returns. But that's<br>exactly how we do it. It's stack-ranked to returns and make the investments in that order.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll go next to Robert Mollins from Wells Fargo.<br>
<b>Robert Michael Mollins</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
First question. Can you guys talk about curbside pickup is performing versus delivery? And are you guys seeing a difference in the<br>average check between the 2?<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Curbside is actually not -- again, curbside, we've only been able to implement in a percentage of our locations. And I'm looking for<br>somebody to tell me exactly the number, but yes, we're limited by, I want to say maybe 60%. Curbside uptake, I think, is not as high<br>as perhaps we had expected initially. Delivery is definitely the growing category. Third-party delivery is huge and growing rapidly.<br>And for the fact that it's only in about half of our locations, it's over-representing right now in terms of growth. In terms of difference<br>in check average, really not much difference in check average. The biggest challenge with anything in off-premise is the loss of the<br>beverage sale, but the guest does seem to get more food even though the average eaters per check is lower. So they embark, they<br>take advantage of getting more food but don't get the beverage. But curbside has not been the dramatic growth piece that we<br>expected. A lot of folks are still walking in. We're seeing about equal balance between online and call-center orders, and continue<br>to see one of the largest components is folks just walking in to the restaurant, which is what we've been doing for years.<br>
<b>Robert Michael Mollins</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Great. And then do you guys have any learnings from the self-delivery test that you guys were doing?<br>
<b>Denny Marie Post</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Not to share yet, but we're looking at it very carefully.<br>
<b>Robert Michael Mollins</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst<br>
Okay, great. And now one more if I could. What are your thoughts around wage inflation for 2018?<br>

<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
I just want to say that about -- of the overall price increase for the year, I want to say about 60% of it was in the earlier price increase<br>and about 40% of it in the October price increase.<br>
<b>Brian Michael Vaccaro</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - VP<br>
Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then on the food cost side, you said modest inflation. Could you provide some more color on the<br>puts and takes within that line, what you're expecting in terms of ground beef and other moving pieces?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes. Ground beef, we're expecting moderate inflation, Brian. And then steak fries is the other one that we called out as being fairly<br>significant. Those are the 2 primary drivers of the food cost inflation that we're expecting for the year. No other real unique issues<br>to point out that are material.<br>
<b>Brian Michael Vaccaro</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - VP<br>
Okay. And then on the labor productivity initiatives. I wanted to ask about just how the teams have adjusted to removing the bussers?<br>And has that initiative now been fully rolled out to the system?<br>

<A name=579></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, RRGB - Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
So we didn't -- aren't commenting specifically about what's been done in quarter, Brian, but the Maestro, as I mentioned on my<br>comment, the Maestro had gone well. All the targets were hit. So I think there's a lot of momentum coming off of that. And we did<br>-- we made those changes in a quarter, where our comp sales and our traffic were very strong. So I think that's building confidence<br>in our operators that we can make these kinds of changes, and that we're making them with an eye towards making sure that the<br>guest experience is at least as good, and in many cases, hopefully better than what we saw before. And getting momentum on these<br>kinds of changes and seeing that they can work and be a positive for the guest experience is helpful for us to get other changes<br>done in the future. The team service approach is obviously an important one for us to get the year started but we have other things<br>in the queue as well.<br>
<b>Brian Michael Vaccaro</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - VP<br>
Okay, so just to be clear, the team service changes though, they are going in during the first quarter as we speak?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes, again, we don't want to give any of the specifics, Brian. But we are making labor changes, we have, as of the start of the year.<br>We're seeing productivity improvements continue.<br>
<b>Brian Michael Vaccaro</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - VP<br>
Okay. And then just one last one on that. Can you quantify, as you think about your labor outlook for 2018, can you quantify the<br>labor savings between the Maestro and other initiatives that are embedded in that guidance? Or have you just embedded the<br>Maestro at this point and there could be potentially more to come? Can you give us some perspective there?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Oh, no, we have other changes embedded in the guidance because the Maestro is worth about $8 million, you will recall, Brian, and<br>we started that in the fourth quarter. So call it 3 quarters of that benefit or $6 million of the improvement will come from Maestro.<br>And for us to offset mid-single-digit inflation on our labor basket, we obviously need a lot more than the Maestro program in order<br>to get to that down 25 to up 25 on labor as a percent of revenues. So we are definitely assuming some other changes in that guidance.<br>
<b>Brian Michael Vaccaro</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - VP<br>
Technology [of] your guidance.<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll take our next question from Gregory Francfort from Bank of America.<br>

<b>Gregory Ryan Francfort</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
I just had an extra question. Just in terms of the quantification of the shift in the week. I think from what you've given us, the extra<br>week from 2017, there's probably 15% to 20% higher than a normal week, which if I do the math, sort of suggests the $5 million<br>move from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. And so we should be like removing $5 million from the first quarter and then adding<br>that on to the fourth quarter. Is that roughly the right way we should be thinking about kind of the math there?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
Yes. I think that's roughly correct, Greg. That if you take into account how much higher the 53rd week is than a typical week, and<br>obviously you have to think about it in a typical Q1 week, that's probably a reasonable assumption as to how you should move the<br>dollars around.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we'll go next to Will Slabaugh from Stephens Inc.<br>
<b>William Everett Slabaugh</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - MD<br>
Just wanted to do a quick follow up on the tax rate if I could. On the 0% to 5% guide, I wanted to make sure that was a sort of a<br>sustainable number as we think about '18 into '19. Is that a number we can count on kind of going forward? Is there anything to<br>point out in '18 that might be a little bit different than what we might expect in future years?<br>
<b>Guy J. Constant</b> - Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - CFO &amp; Executive VP<br>
No, I don't think so, other than just the normal factor in our industry, Will. As earnings rise, tax rate tends to rise, and as earnings go<br>down, tax rate goes down. But assuming the numbers that we guided to, that's a reasonable rate to assume going forward.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Denny Post for any closing remarks.<br>

I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer and President, John Plueger.<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Thanks, Mary Liz. Good afternoon to all of you and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to report that Air Lease closed a strong quarter and<br>another successful year in 2017. Excluding the benefit of favorable tax reform, ALC achieved diluted earnings per share of $1.06 for the fourth<br>quarter, up 19% from the same period of 2016, and ALC's diluted EPS was $3.65 for the full year, up 6% from the full year 2016.<br>
Including the positive impact of tax reform, for the fourth quarter, we're reporting diluted EPS of $4.22, including $3.16 per diluted share, due to<br>the remeasurement of our deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As a result of tax reform, ALC's effective tax rate will be<br>approximately 22% going forward, a decrease from our historical effective tax rate of 35.5%. This means that 38% more of ALC's pretax earnings<br>will hit the bottom line, thereby building shareholder equity faster than previously planned.<br>
As we look around the marketplace, we see good opportunities to deploy this capital to generate strong returns for our shareholders, in line with<br>our current returns. ALC achieved a number of milestones in 2017. To start, Air Lease now has exceeded $15 billion in total assets, up 12% from<br>$14 billion in 2016, and up almost 70% in the past five years. Total revenues exceeded $1.5 billion for the first time in 2017, up 7% year-over-year<br>alone and up more than 75% over the past five years.<br>
Since inception, just eight years ago, our platform has grown to almost 300 aircraft owned and managed by ALC today. This growth has been<br>achieved with a focus on profitability and shareholder returns in mind, and without sacrifice to our profit margins. In fact, over the last four years,<br>ALC has averaged an adjusted pretax margin of 42%. IATA reported just earlier this month that, in 2017, global passenger traffic rose 7.6% compared<br>to 2016, yet again, well above the 10-year average annual growth rate of 5.5%. Load factors were the record calendar year high of 81.4% in 2017.<br>IATA forecasts passenger growth of 6% for 2018, again, above the average annual growth rate. This strong industry backdrop with growing levels<br>of passenger traffic and an ongoing need to replace aging aircraft has driven all around demand for ALC aircraft. Looking forward with a view<br>towards our customers, IATA is projecting an overall growth in global airline profitability for 2018 with slight margin or yield compression forecasted<br>for the airlines.<br>
Despite this slight expected compression, we believe the industry continues to be in relatively good shape and envision no change in demand<br>going forward.<br>
Over the fourth quarter, ALC delivered 12 aircraft, including eight new aircraft from our order book and four used aircraft purchased in the secondary<br>markets. Included in our new aircraft deliveries was our first 737-8 Max to LOT Polish Airlines and A350-900 to Malaysia Airlines.<br>
The demand for new aircraft continues to drive our forward lease placements, which remain at a very robust, 97% through 2019 and now 79%<br>through 2020. So, we are nearly done with placements through 2020. These placements, together with the aircraft we already have on lease, result<br>in ALC having over $23 billion in committed cash flows. We also profitably sold two aircraft in the fourth quarter, one to ALC's managed business,<br>and one to an airline customer. We see continued demand for the used aircraft in our fleet.<br>

<hr>
<A name=585></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, AL - Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call<br>
As many of you are aware, over the last three years, ALC sold $2.8 billion worth of aircraft, and as a result, only 10% of our current fleet is comprised<br>of aircraft over eight years of age, which means we now have fewer candidates for sale. So in 2018, we remain opportunistic as it relates to potential<br>sales, as we always do, but sitting here today, I can tell you that we anticipate no aircraft sales in the first half of 2018.<br>
As to our sidecar platforms and management businesses, they're all performing well and proceeding on track. They continue to complement our<br>core business nicely.<br>
ALC has commitments to purchase over $27 billion worth of aircraft, a total of 368 new aircraft from Airbus and Boeing, with deliveries through<br>2023. ALC's fleet will more than double in size over the next five years as we deliver over 300 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing. We expect 45 of these<br>aircraft to deliver in 2018, accounting for approximately $3.7 billion of capital expenditures.<br>
As should be no surprise to you, we anticipate further delays in our deliveries from Airbus due to engine issues. So as happened in 2017, there may<br>be shifts from quarter-to-quarter in CapEx. The commitment table in our 10-K includes deliveries as best as we know them today. Right now, we<br>anticipate 10 A320 or A321 Pratt &amp; Whitney-powered neos accounting for approximately 15% of the year's total CapEx delivering in 2018.<br>
In the wake of these ongoing delays, we continue to help our impacted customers by extending existing leases, offering substitute aircraft and<br>seeking other remedies from the OEMs. The leasing industry and ALC, in particular, shines in its ability to solve problems and smooth over rough<br>spots in the industry, acting as a buffer and stabilizer. And Air Lease does so profitably.<br>
As to other perceived challenges ahead, of course, we're looking at higher interest rates, but fortunately, all of you who followed us know that we<br>have interest rate adjusters in our lease contracts for forward deliveries, which increased our lease rates as interest rates rise. Additionally, 85% of<br>our debt is fixed on the long end of our maturity curve with 15% floating more on the short end. We continue to issue prudently in the debt capital<br>markets, enjoying very strong demand on our bond offerings, which Greg Willis will talk to you more about. And as a result, you've seen a continued<br>drop in our overall cost of funds. So, I believe, we're in good shape as to the interest rate environment. We believe lease rates for the industry will<br>rise over time as a result of interest rate increases.<br>
Equally as important as how we left 2017 is how we enter 2018. And I can tell you, we believe in the strength of our business, and with the tailwinds<br>from additional capital available through tax reform, the ALC team proceeds enthusiastically and confidently into the remainder of 2018.<br>
I want to extend our heartfelt thanks to our outstanding team at ALC who delivered our results for 2017. They are quite simply the best in the<br>business.<br>
In conclusion, 2017 was a great year for Air Lease. Accordingly, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share on our<br>outstanding common stock for the fourth quarter of 2017.<br>
And with that, let me now turn the call over to our Executive Chairman, Steve Hazy, who will provide further ALC remarks and color on the industry.<br>
Steve, over to you.<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Thanks, John. That was very good. I echo John's sentiments surrounding Air Lease's strong performance in 2017 and the strong outlook for our<br>business going forward.<br>
Air Lease is firing on all cylinders consistently, and our team continues to execute on our business plans and deliver outstanding financial and<br>operating results. The strategy that we envisioned at the inception of the company only eight years ago continues to underpin the strength of the<br>results you see today. We are continuously setting new milestones as we execute with diligence and focus, and we are now concentrated on the<br>landscape ahead. How we can best serve our airline customers and generate superior returns to our shareholders.<br>

<A name=586></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, AL - Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call<br>
On the back of a strong 2017, fundamentals in the operating environment continue to be very, very healthy. We have now seen several consecutive<br>years of overall global airline profitability. Interest rates and fuel are rising but at a manageable pace. Globally, passenger traffic continues to grow<br>ahead of our expectations, and the substantial replacement cycle for aircraft is further driving demand for our leases. We see continued demand<br>from our customers globally. In Asia, for example, this demand is further validated by IATA's report that passenger traffic in the Asia-Pacific region<br>increased 10% in 2017. We're also very pleased to observe that demand out of Europe, specifically, Eastern and Southern Europe, is very strong<br>and grew at a fast clip in 2017. And that continues in the first two months of 2018.<br>
For Europe overall, IATA reported that passenger traffic increased more than 8% year-over-year, with load factors of almost 84%. In the Middle East,<br>there has been incremental need from the LCCs and ULCCs, as we have mentioned in the past few calls, there continues to be an improving airline<br>picture in Latin America.<br>
So, despite a few airline bankruptcies in 2017, as in most other years, this is nothing new to our industry, and we believe the operating environment<br>for airlines remains healthy. Over the last several years, the aircraft lessor community has used our relationships and knowledge of the marketplace<br>and the various regions of the world to help propel the industry when airlines are healthy or assist with moving our mobile assets worldwide when<br>airlines need relief.<br>
Moreover, as key players of scale in the space, we have worked hard to validate the strength of the lessor business model, proving that the right<br>aircraft assets are a strong source of resilient cash flows. The success that Air Lease and other large lessors have had, together with search for returns<br>in the low interest rate environment, have resulted in new interest and an emergence of new capital, particularly, in the sale leaseback market.<br>There are few items related to this that I would like to touch on.<br>
Throughout 2017, there were key reminders that the protections built into our lease agreements, the flexibility gains from our largely unsecured<br>capital structure are vital. There's no better example of this than the Air Berlin and Monarch situations where we were able to find new lessees for<br>the aircraft quickly and at no loss to Air Lease. That is largely due to the fact that ALC collected substantial cash security deposits and cash maintenance<br>reserves, and that the aircraft were not encumbered so we could act with maximum speed and efficiency. We continue this discipline going forward<br>on security deposits, maintenance reserves and very strong return conditions.<br>
Another common misconception is that our airline customers are choosing a lessor solely based on price, but that is unique to the sale leaseback<br>markets where ALC is not active as a participant.<br>
I remind you that, often times, we have been working with an airline for years before a lease agreement is signed. And that there are other factors<br>such as delivery positions, availability of aircraft, which are two of just many items taken into account when an airline is evaluating an aircraft lease.<br>While we remain very competitive on price, most of our campaigns are not won solely on that factor alone.<br>
Finally, I would like to touch on something John noted, interest rates. We are entering a period of rising rates, and we need to see how this new<br>capital will behave. Meanwhile, our airlines know that Air Lease is a reliable strong partner. And we know that funding for our mostly non-investment<br>grade customer base will rise more quickly than our own cost. So, we would expect this to result in incremental and robust demand for aircraft<br>leases, which, ultimately, provide our airline customers with more flexibility and capital relief. So, in conclusion, our view is that there are blue skies<br>ahead, regardless of some noise in the marketplace.<br>
Air Lease's success is driven off the same fundamentals that allowed us to achieve the level of success we have today. And those are choosing the<br>right aircraft types, placing a solid order book years into the future, including appropriate protections in our agreements and continuing to manage<br>our capital structure smartly and conservatively. The dynamics of the industry will continue to evolve, but it is the very consistency of sticking to<br>ALC's founding principles and our strong disciplines that allow us to succeed and be a reliable long-term partner to the airline industry that we<br>always have been.<br>
And with that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Greg, to provide an update on ALC's financing activities for the quarter.<br>

<b>Gregory B. Willis</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Thank you, Steve. As mentioned earlier, we reported another great quarter, generating diluted earnings per share of $1.06 before the effect of tax<br>reform, which added an additional $3.16 to the quarter. The quarterly results were driven by a number of factors, for which I will spend a few<br>minutes walking you through the details.<br>
First off, our total revenues increased by 7.6% to $398 million, which was driven by our aircraft activity and our portfolio lease yields remaining<br>constant. The fourth quarter was our largest quarter of the year in terms of CapEx. Our team purchased 12 aircraft, representing $904 million in<br>CapEx, of which 60% delivered in December. Aircraft sales, trading and other activities increased slightly to $20 million, which included $14.4 million<br>in gains from the sale of two aircraft and insured losses of two aircraft, as well as $3 million in management fees. Also contributing to the increase<br>in revenues was an increase in overhaul revenue, net of amortization of initial direct costs. The increase stems from the recognition of End of Lease<br>income from the Air Berlin and Monarch bankruptcies and is a testament to the strength of our lease security packages. These security packages<br>protect us against airline and credit events and are used to offset the impacts of lost revenues during the periods of transitions, shelter us from the<br>cost incurred during these transitions and provide us security against the condition of the aircraft. As we said in the last call, we experienced strong<br>demand for these aircraft and have executed lease agreements with new airlines.<br>
And as you would expect, we anticipate the remainder of these aircraft will be re-delivered in the first quarter. Accordingly, this End of Lease income<br>has more than offset the transition costs that elevated our SG&amp;A in the quarter and compensated us for these aircraft not contributing rental<br>revenue in the period, which, in aggregate, represented $7 million.<br>
Transitioning to expenses. First off, SG&amp;A was higher when compared to the prior year and prior quarter. And as I just noted, this is partially a result<br>of the aircraft transition costs. As you'll recall, SG&amp;A was exceptionally low in the third quarter as there were fewer transitional-related items. It's<br>worth highlighting that we ended the year with 87 employees with over $15 billion assets. We continue to deliver best-in-class operating efficiency<br>and expect that our revenue growth will continue to outpace our SG&amp;A growth going forward.<br>
Second, interest expense for the quarter was slightly higher as compared to the third quarter of 2017 as a result of higher debt balances. You will<br>see, however, that we continue to benefit from a reduction of our composite cost of funds. Our composite cost of funds is now 3.2%, down more<br>than 6% for the year ended 2016, and our fixed-rate cost is now 3.3%, down more than 100 basis points from 2014 when the 10-year treasury was<br>at similar levels as it is today.<br>
Transitioning to tax, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017, we recorded a net tax benefit of $354 million in the fourth<br>quarter, resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities at a new statutory rate of 21%. This revaluation increased ALC's equity<br>base, providing us increased flexibility for opportunistic growth. In addition to the effects of tax reform, we recorded an $11 million tax benefit<br>from the utilization of foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 22%, as compared<br>to around 35.5% historically. Looking forward to 2018, we expect to deliver 45 aircraft from our order book, representing $3.7 billion in capital<br>expenditures. We are expecting $440 million in CapEx in Q1, $1.25 billion in Q2, $770 million in Q3 and $1.2 billion in Q4. Consistent with prior<br>years, these numbers do not include any incremental purchases as this relates to aircraft sales. Consistent with John's comments, we're anticipating<br>no aircraft sales in the first half of 2018.<br>
Moving to the financing side of the business. Since our last call, we issued $2.3 billion in senior unsecured notes across the curve, issuing 3s, 5s, 7s<br>and 10s. The weighted average cost of these issuances was 3% with the weighted average life of these issuances being 6.4 years. ALC ended 2017<br>with a substantial level of liquidity at $3.2 billion including our four-year revolving credit facility, which stands at $3.9 billion.<br>
Looking ahead, we remain committed to our financing strategies of 80% fixed rate debt, 90% unsecured debt and a debt-to-equity target ratio of<br>2.5:1. As of 12/31/2017, we were at 85% fixed, 95% unsecured and a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.35x. As John noted, revaluing our deferred tax liability<br>in the fourth quarter resulted in our debt-to-equity ratio decreasing to 2.35x. However, there's no change to our target leverage ratio of 2.5x. This<br>concludes my review of the results and financing activities of the company. I'll now turn it back to Mary Liz.<br>

<b>Mary Liz DePalma</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Assistant VP of IR<br>
Thanks, Greg. This concludes the management's remarks. (Q&amp;A Instructions) I'd like to turn the call over to the operator to open the line for the<br>Q&amp;A.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jason Arnold with RBC Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Jason Michael Arnold</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Director in the Equity Research and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Just curious if you have any further color or thoughts around what you might do with the $354 million uptick to the equity account. Just curious,<br>you're the taxman there. Basic math-wise, it's, I, guess, a $1.2 billion of extra aircraft you could theoretically buy now, but any other color there<br>would be helpful.<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, Jason, as I hope I alluded to or came up strong in, in my opening remarks, yes, we see great opportunities in the marketplace to deploy this<br>additional capital effectively, and those are our plans. We have already signed an LOI on a couple of additional aircraft, more are on the way. And<br>we continue to work with the manufacturers in accelerating anything forward that we can but, basically, we believe in deployment of that capital<br>consistently along the same lines as we deploy the rest of our capital.<br>
<b>Jason Michael Arnold</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Director in the Equity Research and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay, great. And then, I guess a follow up, just curious if you can update us on your views around the supply chain. Some of the OEMs are talking<br>about some for their production rate hikes and just curious to hear your updated thoughts there.<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
I think the OEMs are making adjustments based on demand and also on the supply chain's ability to sustain that demand. We've seen increases in<br>the 787-9, 787-10 production rates. We've seen decreases in the Boeing 777 production rates, leading up to the introduction of the Boeing 777X<br>planned for 2020. We've seen reduction in production rates on the A330s, as the A330neo comes online later this year. The A350 production rates<br>are almost now at 10 a month, so that's the target rate that Airbus has forecast. And on the single aisle airplane category, you see the results that<br>Boeing and Airbus published in terms of how many units they actually delivered in 2017. And you can just divide that by 12 and see what the<br>average output was. There was a surge of deliveries for both companies, Airbus and Boeing, in the December month to get as many aircraft delivered<br>to their customers. We'll see a much slower level of activity in January and February. But both are working very hard to make some small production<br>rate increases on a progressive basis and, basically, to cure a problem that they have in that they're overbooked right now on single aisle aircraft.<br>They have more orders for the next three years than they can actually produce. So, you're going to see some reshuffling of some deliveries by some<br>airlines. You'll see decelerations, you'll see some postponements, you'll see some accelerations like Air Lease. So, I think, overall, it's a pretty balanced<br>equation.<br>

<b>Moshe Ari Orenbuch</b> - Cr�dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst<br>
Greg, you talked a little bit about some of the impacts on the revenue side of the aircraft that you took back. Is all of that in other income? Is some<br>of it in the lease, in the quarter lease revenue line? Where does that show up?<br>
<b>Gregory B. Willis</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
It shows up in the rental revenue line. If you look in the MD&amp;A, you can see it. We call out overhaul revenue net of prepaid lease cost amortization<br>and you can see that number right there.<br>
<b>Moshe Ari Orenbuch</b> - Cr�dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst<br>
Got it. Okay, you hadn't had a chance to go through that yet.<br>
<b>Gregory B. Willis</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
No, of course.<br>
<b>Moshe Ari Orenbuch</b> - Cr�dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst<br>
And I guess, as kind of a follow up, there's been some bit of disruption in the leasing market in terms of the corporate ownership of a couple of<br>lessors, some real, some talked about. Any thoughts about whether that kind of creates opportunities for Air Lease between some of the things<br>we've heard out from Nordic and some...<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
What do you mean by disruption?<br>
<b>Moshe Ari Orenbuch</b> - Cr�dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst<br>
Well, I mean that there are companies that have talked about putting things up, Nordic Aviation possibly being -- its leasing business up for sale<br>and obviously the issues that are around the ownership of Avolon.<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Right. So Moshe, thanks. We constantly review, as we should, all these opportunities. And anything that's for sale, you can rest assure that many<br>investment banks bring them promptly to our attention. We always have an inherent bias to buy assets, and we are poised now with a lot of capital<br>to buy well-priced assets but on a disciplined basis. In terms of anything else that's for sale, I think our answer is, as it always is, we always take a<br>look, and if we see that there's any strategic advantages beyond just bulk purchases of fleets or aircraft, we will act accordingly. But so far, we like<br>our organic growth and anything that we would do from an M&amp;A perspective, comes with a lot of trade-offs and we look at those trade-offs. But<br>at the end of the day, I can only tell you, rest assured, that we do evaluate any opportunities, and whenever we see something, that looks appealing,<br>we will act on it. But so far, I know what you're talking about in terms of ownership, et cetera. We're watching the landscape and looking for<br>opportunities, and that's about all I can say.<br>

<A name=590></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, AL - Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
As John said earlier, we actually will more than double in size in the next, roughly, four and a half to five years. So to our organic growth, even if<br>we don't add any incremental orders or we don't purchase opportunistic groups of aircraft or distress situations, the company has a very strong<br>growth path ahead of it over the next four or five years without any M&amp;A activity. If, however, there is an M&amp;A opportunity, which is significantly<br>accretive and boosts our overall shareholder value, we're certainly going to take a look at it.<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes, look, we certainly do not feel that we have any lack of scale. So doing something just for scale overnight or in a quarter, it's just not something<br>that we find that we're short of in the industry. We're able to compete very, very effectively and we believe we have quite sufficient scale today.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.<br>
<b>Nishant Mani</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst<br>
This is actually Nish Mani on for Jamie. I want to ask you about the new midsized aircraft type that could potentially launch from Boeing. And I was<br>hoping to get your thoughts on whether you would expect a launch potentially this year at an air show or if you think it has come down the road<br>and whether or not you've thought about any launch customers being lessors relative to airline customers?<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Yes. Boeing would love nothing more than for Air Lease to be a launch customer. Look, for the last five or six years, we've been deeply, and in great<br>detail, engaged with Boeing on defining what is the optimal aircraft size and capability, because they do have a gap between the 737 and the 787,<br>an airplane that could replace 757, 767, some of the older smaller widebody aircraft. And I think Boeing is going through a continued refinement<br>of that definition. They're also looking very closely internally as to what the cost of implementing such a program, and then coming up with an<br>economical pricing formula that the airlines and the leasing community can actually afford and justify. So that process is ongoing. I know that<br>Boeing had a lot of resources dedicated to this. But we're just not in the position to make any predictions whether it would be launched at the air<br>show this year or next year or later this year. It's all got to come together. The business case has to come together for Boeing. The supply chain has<br>to be properly lined up to avoid the catastrophes of the 787 startup. It's got to be affordable. It has to be an airplane that's capable of filling those<br>gaps that I mentioned earlier. And it has to be an attractive economic proposition for the lessors and the airlines. And when all those things are<br>satisfied, then we would hope to see progress. But we just don't see that in the next couple of months. I mean this is a very ambitious undertaking<br>and with lots of moving pieces. And just keep your eyes and ears open to developments.<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Nish, it's price, price, price.<br>
<b>Nishant Mani</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst<br>
I'm sure the guys in Renton don't want to hear that necessarily. Just one quick follow-up question. We know we've talked in the past about low-cost,<br>long-haul operators and the disruptive threat they can kind of pose over the Atlantic. Since we've had that conversation, Norwegian, in particular,<br>has seen losses increase and part of that has obviously been driven by the Transatlantic activity. My question is, have you guys thought about kind<br>of that business model having changed over the past several months and years? Or are you still optimistic on that business model and is that an<br>area where Air Lease wants to increasingly be exposed to?<br>

<A name=591></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, AL - Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes, well, look I understand your question, and it's always been a classic question about the long-haul low-cost model. But truthfully, we think that<br>train has left the station. While there may be property lease squeezes in Norwegian, from a macro perspective, whether a low-cost, long-haul<br>operator is formed or birth from a legacy carrier, like we have examples of today, or whether it's a standalone Norwegian, there's just too many<br>examples. And folding into those examples, even using single aisle aircraft like a number of carriers are doing across the Atlantic, and you pointed<br>out, we believe the long-haul, low-cost model is probably here to stay.<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Yes, no question.<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
And it's so far out of the gate that there really is no going back.<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
You do have to observe, however, that the North Atlantic market is very seasonal. It's highly seasonal. So, a long-haul, low-cost operator doesn't<br>have a network balance to offset some of that degradation in traffic in the winter months, it's going to have issues in the fourth and the first quarter.<br>So, what we'll see is some of these airlines will make adjustments to perhaps capture North, South traffic or entry into the Caribbean or other ways<br>of sort of neutralizing those seasonalities. But -- because when you have a very high capital cost airplane flying 400 hours a month, and you're<br>flying at a 50% or 60% load factor, there's no way to make money. So, these airlines will have to figure out ways of using those assets, year-round<br>on an efficient basis. Now what we've seen in other parts of the world, like AirAsia X and Jetstar, which is owned by Qantas, those airlines are now<br>profitable on a year-round basis because they have -- they've been around longer, and they've made adjustments to the way they operate their<br>networks. So, we do see some light at the end of the tunnel but Norwegian definitely has challenges. We don't have any aircraft there. But they'll<br>have to deal with these realities of the market place.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Caintic of Stephens.<br>
<b>Vincent Albert Caintic</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Specialty Finance Analyst<br>
I wanted to focus on the interest rate impact, specifically. So maybe a couple of things. First, if you can give us a flavor of how quickly should we<br>start to see, maybe lease rates rise. Rental income was strong in this quarter. Just kind of wanted to get a sense for that. And then, broadly speaking<br>from your experience, how does rates rising affect how airlines think about the attractiveness of leasing versus other types of aircraft financing?<br>And then, on lessor competition, I'm wondering what you've seen in the past for how rising rates affects competition. You've heard of some<br>competitors with liquidity issues, maybe they funded short. And so, you've alluded to ALC being a reliable partner, and so how do you think about<br>the other competition going forward?<br>
<b>Gregory B. Willis</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
So Vincent, I'll take the first one with regard to lease rates. On our new delivering airplanes that have interest rate adjusters, we're seeing the impacts<br>of a rising rate environment show up today, right. So as a function of those adjusters, rates rise, our lease rates adjust at delivery. So, we are definitely<br>seeing the benefit of those adjusters.<br>

<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
As to your second part of your question, Vincent, can you repeat the second part?<br>
<b>Vincent Albert Caintic</b> - Stephens Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Specialty Finance Analyst<br>
Right. So just -- I guess how airlines view the attractiveness of leasing versus other types of financing and rising rates. And then also, how does<br>other aircraft -- the lessor competition that you see out there, how do they behave in a rising rate environment, particularly as some of them might<br>not have much fund.<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Look. As compared to alternative forms of financing, airlines that finance classically through their balance sheet, whether it's double ATC or whatever<br>financing structure, those costs are going to go up. And I think we made the point earlier that most of our customers are noninvestment grade<br>credits. And so, we believe their interest rate cost will probably go up at a faster clip than ours will as an investment grade company. So, we see<br>that actually as a net positive in how airlines view the operating lease specifically. Competitively, everyone pays for money. I don't care where<br>you're from. And so, I really see everybody on a more equal playing field there with the cost of funds going up. That's a consequence that all<br>financiers and lessors have to have. I think the advantage that we have is with our investment grade credit, we're going to continue to enjoy a<br>benefit as to what our -- most of our customers could borrow at.<br>
<b>Gregory B. Willis</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
I would just add that, as rates rise, the sale leaseback guys aren't as committed to -- the ones without order books are not committed to the business.<br>So, you don't know for certain if they're going to be there next year or not. They have CapEx targets, they like to deploy capital, and if there's other<br>opportunities that are more attractive to them, they're going to deploy that capital elsewhere. So, it's hard to say if they will be there as compared<br>to us, where we have an order book, and we are committed to the business.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Deutsche Bank.<br>
<b>Catherine M. O'Brien</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
So I'm going to ask the first one and hand it over to my colleague, Michael Linenberg, who's also on the line for a follow-up. So my question is, can<br>you talk about how you expect management revenue to grow over the medium terms? Do you guys have any target in terms of percentage of<br>total revenue? And then, also given your comments earlier on fewer expected sales for 2018, should we assume your managed fleet and the<br>associated revenue will grow at a slower pace this year than in 2017?<br>
<b>Gregory B. Willis</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
The management business -- the management fees are tied to assets under management. And as we find attractive opportunities for our managed<br>ventures, they will take those on, and those will drive management fees. We haven't given color as to how fast we're seeing -- we anticipate those<br>fees growing, but as we find good opportunities that are suitable, the management ventures will buy them and then they'll start generating<br>management fees. But the first and foremost step is to figure out -- is to find assets that are profitable for our partners because we want them to<br>be there for the long term.<br>

Okay, and so then just given your comments on fewer sales this year, that includes sales into your management businesses, correct?<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Well, what we said is that in the first half of '18, we're not currently planning or projecting sales because we're trying to build up the owned portfolio<br>as much as possible. But to the extent that we find attractive assets to put into the managed platforms, we will do so.<br>
<b>Gregory B. Willis</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, we're trying to keep the asset decisions separate from the other capital decisions.<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes, look, we are asset managers, and we are residual managers. So, if we find an unbelievable -- we do have a lot of people coming to us, but we<br>just have less aircraft in the eight-year old space to sell. So even though we say we don't anticipate any, there's a -- in the first half of the year, there's<br>some chance that somebody may come to us and we may make a determination opportunistically, as we always do, then, okay, we'll sell it. But<br>we're just calling it as we see it here today.<br>

<b>Catherine M. O'Brien</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Oh, go ahead.<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Yes, I was just going to say the first half of the year, we're more focused on building our balance sheet, our revenues on the leasing side, our core<br>business because we did have this impact in the fourth quarter of the tax law change that gives us more capital to deploy. So, we're focused on<br>growing the company as opposed to shedding assets. But we're out in the marketplace looking for assets into the managed platforms. And we're<br>working very hard on that to add additional aircraft to the managed platforms along with additional assets for our basic core business. So, first half<br>of the year, we're very focused on building the business and growing assets and revenues.<br>

Just a quick kind of technical question. There have been some reports out there that Airbus is considering another stretch of the A321neo, I guess,<br>as a response to Boeing's NMA aircraft. And I'm just -- based on your knowledge in customers, I mean, you stretch an A321neo and you got a really<br>narrow shell, and obviously you're going to need more powerful engines on one hand.

shell, what does it take, 45 minutes for people to get on and off the airplane? I mean, I'm just -- is that even -- logistically, would that be possible?<br>Certainly not for an airline like a low-cost carrier doing quick turns. Just your thoughts on that.<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Yes, Boeing already tried that with the 757-300. And even though, on paper, it's the lowest seat mile cost, single-aisle airplane, it didn't sell very<br>well. I think there are opportunities for Airbus to make some relatively small improvements to the A321neo. But our belief is, with the current<br>management changes and issues that Airbus is facing, I don't think this is their number one priority right now. And I think it's also in their interest<br>to see what Boeing does and doesn't do before they make any product decisions along those lines.<br>

What has already been announced by Airbus previously is they are looking at a slightly higher weight version that can accommodate some more<br>seats, a few more seats but not a drastic model stretch or a re-wing or anything else like that. I'm sure there's many things on the drawing board.<br>But right now, what seems the most obvious and the easiest to do is a little bit of gross weight increase and a few more seats.<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
But that would involve additional engine thrust. And obviously that's an issue that they'll have to sort out with CFM and with Pratt &amp; Whitney. So,<br>I think on their list of priorities, if you think, 10 of the highest, I don't believe that the -- or what we call, the super A321 is, right now, at the top of<br>the list.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen.<br>
<b>Helane Renee Becker</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
Just a couple of questions. The first question is with respect to the geography. Maybe you can give us an update on what you're seeing in your<br>various markets? And I noticed that, in the past year, you've actually leased in more aircraft to the EMEA region, specifically actually, Middle East<br>and Africa. Is that a trend that you think will exist going forward?<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well we've seen a lot of demand for the growing low cost and ultra-low-cost carriers in the Middle East. And so yes, we have leased additional<br>aircraft to that region. And we think that that's pretty straightforward. And as to the rest of our business, you see from our tables, about Asia is still<br>overall about 43% of our business and about half of that is China. But I think -- Steve outlined in his comments the surprising strength we see still<br>in Europe, and Eastern and Southern Europe, going forward. And I think, you're going to see us adding a little bit to South America as that region<br>is improving. Brazil has actually turned the corner, we believe it's in a positive growth mode, the airlines, Argentina, Chile, et cetera, et cetera. And<br>as a result, you see a lot more LCC and ULCC growth and startups in that region as well. They take advantage of it.<br>
<b>Helane Renee Becker</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
And then, may I just follow up with one another question? Do you put the U.K. into Europe category?<br>

<A name=595></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, AL - Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Yes. Yes, I mean, today, they are still formally part of Europe. And it's too early to tell what effect on interline and bilateral treaties Brexit will have<br>from a regulatory point of view. So at this point in time, we have aircraft with companies like British Airways, we have aircraft going into Virgin<br>Atlantic, we have Thomas Cook group. So we have a strong presence there. We have not seen any issues with those customers. But for the time<br>being, we count the United Kingdom as part of Europe.<br>
<b>Helane Renee Becker</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
Right. So that was actually my question, and you anticipated part of it. I was just kind of wondering, if you will -- we will need to have a bilateral<br>agreement in place for you to continue doing business there or if that's a separate -- your business is completely separate from any of their...<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Yes. We're not regulated.<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Yes, we're separate.<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Yes, we're separate. It's the individual countries that the United Kingdom will have to negotiate with either collectively as the EU or with individual<br>countries to reinstate what we call the old bilateral airline treaties. But we don't expect the island of Great Britain to be cut off from the rest of the<br>world in terms of airline transportation. I think there will be deals forged because, after all, a lot of foreign airlines do tremendous business flying<br>to the U.K. and the U.K. airlines fly outside the U.K. So I think, there will be a solution, and it will probably have minimal, if any, effect on Air Lease.<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
I would just say, we see no evidence of a decline in demand. We have several ongoing campaigns, specifically with carriers in the U.K. sitting here<br>today. It's just really hard to see that there's any change as a result of Brexit.<br>
<b>Helane Renee Becker</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst<br>
All right, okay. And then may I just ask Greg one question about the table on this page whatever it is, right before the conference call where your<br>debt is listed, you have export credit financing having declined last year. Is that just maturities rolling off?<br>
<b>Gregory B. Willis</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. We did a deal back in 2012 for two 737-800s, and that just represents the standard amortization profile of the deal.<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Yes, it's a 12-year amortization profile on two 737-800s that are leased to an Asian, a large Asian airline, where we have bank guarantee and we<br>issued bonds. So that it comes down every what? Six months?<br>

<b>Gregory B. Willis</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes, quarterly amortization, but the -- those deals were done before they changed the rules and increased the upfront fees.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.<br>
<b>Rajeev Lalwani</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director<br>
John, actually, a question for you. Can you just talk about the overall used aircraft market? Do you think it's more of a buyer or a seller's market<br>today? It seems like with some of the actions you're taking here in the first half of the year, it might be more of a -- maybe more of a buyer's market,<br>but would just love your thoughts.<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
No. We still have more people coming to us to buy airplanes than, frankly, we have to sell. What I'm trying to say in our remarks is, with the success<br>of a transfer of a number of midlife aircraft at Thunderbolt that we did last year, we have just under 10% of our aircraft left in our fleet that are over<br>eight years of age. And we adhere to our founding principles which is we like to enjoy the aircraft about the first 1/3 of its useful life or 25 years, so<br>that's eight-plus years and change. So I would say, no, I would say, it is still a seller's market for aircraft as evidenced by everybody that keeps coming<br>to us and others for a robust demand of all aircraft. Our -- I think Steve framed it well, we're focusing on growth of our asset base. Because we're<br>earning good yields, good returns on these products, and we have a little bit of capital now additionally through the benefit of the tax Reform Act.<br>So naturally, we're going to utilize that, grow accordingly. But I would not say -- no, I don't think it's a buyer's market, I think it is still a seller's market.<br>
<b>Rajeev Lalwani</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director<br>
Okay, very helpful. And then a separate question. As it relates to your comments around just lease yields going up with higher interest rates can<br>you provide maybe some historical perspective? Did we in fact see some pressure on lease yields over the last several years as interest rates were<br>low such that, if they reversed, we should see some upward pressure?<br>
<b>Gregory B. Willis</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. In our last Investor Day, we show show our chart of our historical portfolio lease yield over the last five, six years, and it was incredibly consistent.<br>We've done a great job of preserving our lease yields as rates went down. Also it graphs out of our average age and our average lease term to show<br>that those two key variables were also constant. So we weren't playing with the age or the lease duration. And then as I mentioned earlier, right,<br>we're starting to see upward pressure on our lease rates on our aircraft that are delivering with interest rate adjusters as a function of the current<br>higher interest rates environment that we're looking at today, right? But it's also really important to point out on the financing side that the last<br>time the 10-year treasury was this high, our fixed-rate financing costs were 100 basis points higher. So we've completed the transition to being<br>investment-grade. We have BBB ratings from S&amp;P, Fitch and an A- from Kroll, and I think we're in a really strong position with 85% of fixed-rate<br>debt.<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
And as we look back in 2017, we're not seeing margin compression.In other words, the difference between the lease rental factors and our cost of<br>funds.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.<br>
<b>Kristine Tan Liwag</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
Steve and John, the engine OEMs have been pushing power by the hour contracts with these new engine derivatives compared to the previous<br>variants. And so, to the extent that they do, how do power by the hour contracts change how you think about maintenance costs and maintenance<br>reserves? And then, ultimately, how do you assess maintenance risk of these new technologies coming into the market?<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, look, the engine care agreements have actually been there for quite a number of years. And yes, of course the engine OEMs are pushing these<br>engine care agreements. There's a benefit to us in that it helps our airline customers manage the return, the condition of the engines at return of<br>the lease. And we are assured also of the quality maintenance pursuant to delivery of these engines to the OEM shops during the course of the<br>lease. So, it actually is a strength to our residual values. As to the reliability, et cetera, well, things haven't started off really robustly, I would just say.<br>But nevertheless, those things are getting fixed. And most of the engine care programs, properly drafted, put the burden back on the engine guys<br>if there's any reliability or performance degradation issues across the board. So, I would say in a nutshell, it helps us with the residual value of our<br>assets and I think, it helps our operators because the engine OEMs, it's on their nickel, to replace whatever needs fixing or updating or modifying<br>in the new technology engines.<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Kristine, one of the things that we're very conscious of and watch very carefully is that these packages are transportable from one airline to another.<br>In other words, if we have a lease on an airline and it goes for, say, seven or eight years, the airline has paid in a certain amount of reserves to the<br>engine supplier under this total care program and then we lease the aircraft to another airline, so we want to make sure that those funds that have<br>been paid in and have not been utilized by the OEMs are available to the next airline when they have shop visits and other maintenance activity<br>that's covered under the total care agreement. So that's something that's special and unique to the leasing community to make sure that the assets<br>continue to have the benefit of whatever funding went in there to support the engines.<br>
<b>Kristine Tan Liwag</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP<br>
I see. So, for the aircraft that are under power by the hour, does that mean that the lessee pays directly to the engine OEMs or do they still go<br>through your maintenance reserves and your balance sheet? And then second, what percent of your total aircraft order will be under power by<br>the hour?<br>
<b>John L. Plueger</b> - Air Lease Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director<br>
Well, let me just start with the first part. We have both. So, three large engine providers, Pratt, Rolls and GE. We have both types of, agreements.<br>We have agreements where we are past the reserves and that, at various points, we pass them on to the OEM. We also have --[agreements] where<br>the engine care payments go directly to the OEMs. And sometimes, we receive a separate reserve for, what's called LLPs. So, we have all kinds of<br>agreements. I have no idea what -- I mean we have 360 some odd airplanes on our forward orders which we have today. I have no idea what<br>percentage from that total is going to be covered under engine care programs. I mean just sitting here today, that is the business model of the<br>engine manufacturers. And by the way, that model transfers risk to them as I indicated in my comments. So, it's hard for us to sit here and say how<br>far forward our order book will be. Not all, not all of our customers, are using the engine care program. So, I would say the majority of the aircraft,<br>

the new technology, the neos, the MAXs, 787s, probably more than half of our customers will want to avail themselves of these engine care programs<br>because they shed risk.<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Yes, the other thing is that as more and more airlines set up their own shops and their own capability to maintain and overhaul these engines, then<br>it gives other airline operators that could potentially normally sign up for a total care agreement with the manufacturer, they might then shop<br>around between the OEM's program and airlines that will offer fixed price contracts to do a shop visit. So as more and more shops are able to handle<br>these engines, these new technology engines that could actually be some headwinds toward an airline, joining this program because they'll have<br>various alternatives where to send the engines for heavy maintenance. So, we're seeing headwinds and tailwinds at the same time going forward.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next question comes from the line of Scott Valentin with Compass Point.<br>
<b>Scott Jean Valentin</b> - Compass Point Research &amp; Trading, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Research Analyst<br>
Just with regard to the two aircraft you sold, I think the gain was $14.4 million. Did you guys disclose what the margin was, again, sell margin was<br>for the aircraft?<br>
<b>Gregory B. Willis</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
14.4 includes the two that were sold as well as the insured loss on the other two aircraft. But we did not -- I mean, we you can see it in the -- we<br>don't disclose individual gains. But you can see on average if you go to our 10-K what the gain percentage was for the year going forward.<br>
<b>Scott Jean Valentin</b> - Compass Point Research &amp; Trading, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Research Analyst<br>
All right, and I assume that nothing really changed in the fourth quarter, it would be consistent with the whole year average, is that fair?<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Correct.<br>
<b>Scott Jean Valentin</b> - Compass Point Research &amp; Trading, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Research Analyst<br>
And then on the CapEx, the $3.7 billion, does not include any of the LOIs you mentioned? Or is that just straight OEM deliveries for the year?<br>

<b>Scott Jean Valentin</b> - Compass Point Research &amp; Trading, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Research Analyst<br>
OEM only. Okay, and then one last follow-up question. There's been some talk about some of the neo/MAX lease rates and the premium you're<br>getting over the current tech. Have you seen any change in the premium? Has it declined at all? Or has it been relatively stable from when you first<br>started putting the orders in and thinking about where lease rates would be -- the premium would be when you put the orders in?<br>
<b>Steven F. Udvar-Hazy</b> - Air Lease Corporation - Founder &amp; Executive Chairman<br>
Yes. There was some pressure on the premiums last year. But since the very end of the fourth quarter, where we began to see oil prices begin to<br>sort of inch up, the premium, again, is coming back into life. Obviously, for an airline, the analysis between current generation versus the neo or<br>MAX, a $10, $20 oil price difference does enter the equation. So, we're monitoring that very carefully. There is a premium. It's not as good as we<br>were hoping. But I think the trend now is getting better.<br>

And I'm showing no further questions at this time. So, I'd like to return the call to Miss Mary Liz DePalma for any closing remarks.<br>

<A name=602></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:00PM, FTI.N - Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call<br>
<b>Douglas J. Pferdehirt</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CEO and Director<br>
Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call.<br>
We delivered another quarter of solid results, further demonstrating our commitment to strong operational execution, the realization of merger<br>synergies and a commercial focus that's driven to take a completely new business model to market and win. Q4 serves as another important<br>milestone in our brief history that further validates our commitment to deliver results for all of our stakeholders.<br>
Total company revenues were $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter, with all segments delivering strong performance in the period. Total adjusted<br>EBITDA was $573 million, demonstrating strong growth over the prior year period, with margins up 360 basis points to 15.6% on a pro forma basis.<br>Total company orders were $3 billion and year-end backlog stands at $13 billion. And in Subsea, we achieved a full year book-to-bill of just under<br>1 on the strength of a solid Q4 inbound.<br>
2017 proved to be a strong start to our first year as TechnipFMC. The women and men of our new company stepped up to the challenge in this<br>time of significant change, achieving early and important success for our company. Executing and winning, that's how we drove our success in<br>2017, and we see even more opportunity ahead given the strength of our market positions and our advantages in both new business models and<br>new technologies. Solid execution led to our strong financial results. Operationally, we have relentlessly focused on project execution. And despite<br>the usual distractions of merger integration, our operational performance was both ahead of plan and market expectations.<br>
We have been delivering some of the most complex and challenging projects across the globe. Importantly, we have executed without losing<br>focus on the most important element, the health and wellbeing of our employees and partners.<br>
I would also like to reiterate that we're delivering on our merger synergies and doing so ahead of plan, and we are well on track to generate $450<br>million in annualized savings by the end of 2019.<br>
In addition to executing on our large backlog of projects, we also secured several new awards over the course of the year. 2017 marked the inflection<br>in Subsea order activity, with operators moving forward on final investment decisions for several major developments. This resulted in a significant<br>step-up in our full year Subsea inbound to $5.1 billion, a 27% increase year-over-year.<br>
Our integrated business model is expanding the deepwater opportunity set with new Subsea projects, many of which would have never moved<br>forward without the significant benefits we can bring to the market. And our differentiation extends beyond iEPCITM, with a continued focus on<br>developing the next generation of technology.<br>
In November, we announced the launch of a completely new suite of products we call Subsea 2.0. This technology portfolio significantly reduces<br>the size, weight and part count of the equipment installed on the seabed. The market reception has been highly encouraging, with strong operator<br>interest. We also continue to make substantial progress with new offerings in the LNG, FLNG and Surface markets.<br>
Now let me discuss the market outlook. When we consider the Subsea market over our longer-term time horizon, 3 themes are very evident to us.<br>Smaller projects and direct awards are becoming a much more meaningful portion of our order mix. In 2017, these awards represented just over<br>half of our total inbound, with the remainder being named projects and Subsea services. Subsea tiebacks are often part of this mix. These shorter-cycle<br>brownfield expansions provide operators with faster paybacks and higher returns. We also see a growing trend towards independents and new<br>entrants undertaking subsea developments. TechnipFMC is the natural partner for this customer group. And natural gas developments are growing<br>in prominence. By early next decade, we could see more than half of offshore capex directed at gas developments.<br>
Looking more broadly to the natural gas markets. Natural gas continues to take share of global energy demand. This trend is structural, driven by<br>market preference for cleaner energy sources and the need to satisfy growing domestic demand in markets such as the Middle East. To meet this<br>demand, large gas projects will need to be sanctioned between now and 2020 and more beyond that.<br>

<A name=603></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:00PM, FTI.N - Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call<br>
TechnipFMC is very well suited to this market dynamic, and we are seeing a resurgence of prospects in this market. For example, we recently were<br>shortlisted on the LNG Canada project, and we have further opportunities in the Arctic region and the Middle East in the medium term. Genesis,<br>TechnipFMC's agnostic engineering services provider, is very active on concept studies across the globe. FEED activity has also picked up more<br>broadly. For example, we are currently active on the Dalma FEED, which is part of the United Arab Emirates' desire to become energy independent.<br>And we're also working on several brownfield projects in Asia Pacific that will be required to supply existing LNG infrastructure. Furthermore,<br>discoveries offshore East Africa, West Africa and the Mediterranean Sea continue to provide multiple opportunities for our company.<br>
In the downstream sector, we continue to see a good level of project activity in the near term, where we are pursuing several refining, petrochemical<br>and fertilizer projects. We have previously discussed near-term prospects with an aggregate inbound value to TechnipFMC of over $5 billion. In<br>December, we announced the signing of the BAPCO Sitra Refinery award in Bahrain, one of the projects contemplated in this list. The remaining<br>prospects are progressing well, and we are confident of further awards during 2018.<br>
We continue to track LNG and downstream projects that amount to additional revenue potential in the coming years. Our involvement in any of<br>the mentioned LNG projects could provide considerable incremental inbound value. Our early involvement in these projects is critical to our success.<br>We do not chase volumes in this market. Our differentiated model is supported by strong process technology portfolio, our involvement and<br>front-end capabilities, robust risk management process and our 60-year track record of project delivery.<br>
With respect to the outlook for Surface Technologies, we expect global activity levels to continue to improve in 2018. In our business, we anticipate<br>that most of the improvement will occur in North America, while the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Europe are best poised for international growth,<br>although pricing remains challenged. In North America, we believe that we will see further market improvements, primarily driven by increased<br>unconventional activity.<br>
And while the rig count has recovered off the cycle lows, the number of active rigs today is still over 40% below the 2014 peak. In products that<br>are highly correlated to rig count such as wellheads, the effect on sales is fairly easy to quantify. But not everything is tied to the rig count. In fact,<br>the most accretive portion of our North America portfolio is driven by the hydraulic fracturing market, where activity has benefited from the trend<br>towards longer laterals and a higher number of frac stages per well. The frac stage count per well has moved steadily higher through this down-cycle,<br>owing to increased frac intensity per well. This translates into more activity, more product sales and more services on each individual well. For us,<br>this benefits several of our key consumable product and service lines, particularly flowlines, fluid ends and our frac rental services.<br>
To put this recovery into perspective, we believe that revenues in 2018 for our North America Surface business will begin to approach the levels<br>we achieved at the cycle peak in 2014. This is despite materially lower prices and rig count and reduced product and service pricing. While our<br>expectations for commodity prices are largely in line with current levels, we do expect a modest increase in rig count throughout the year.<br>
Now let me close the outlook with a deeper look at the Subsea project landscape. Back in 2016, we called the inflection point in Subsea orders.<br>What transpired was even greater than we had anticipated, with our Subsea orders increasing by 27% year-over-year.<br>
I'd now like to share with you some of the key opportunities we see in our updated Subsea opportunity slide. The changes from the previous update<br>demonstrate that the industry continues to move forward. 5 projects from the prior list where approved for development and have now been<br>removed. We have also added 5 new projects to this update. In total, we now show 18 large projects that could be sanctioned over the next 24<br>months. This list represents both Subsea production systems and SURF scope, a significant opportunity set for us given the breadth of our product,<br>service and unique commercial offering.<br>
At our Analyst Day, I stated our confidence in a further step-up in Subsea inbound orders in 2018. With the momentum in FEED and tendering<br>activity for both traditional and integrated EPCI projects, we continue to expect that we will see an increase in overall market activity. We remain<br>confident that our inbound orders will grow year-over-year, and that as much as 25% of these new orders will come from our new iEPCITM integrated<br>model in 2018.<br>
In closing, the fourth quarter marked another period of strong performance for TechnipFMC, providing a powerful reminder of the many successes<br>we shared throughout the year. We are executing, and we are winning, and we continue to take further actions around costs, new business models<br>

and new technologies to further improve our competitive position. Despite near-term revenue pressure in our 2 largest businesses, the markets<br>in which we operate continue to improve. We expect to benefit from continued operational momentum and further progression of our synergy<br>savings. And our 2017 performance gives us greater confidence in 2018.<br>
I will now turn the call over to Maryann.<br>
<b>Maryann T. Mannen</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CFO and EVP<br>
Thanks, Doug. While our discussions today focus on fourth quarter results, we are pleased with our full year results as well, which demonstrated<br>solid execution in all of our business segments throughout the entire year. Our previous restructuring activities, the merger synergies we have<br>captured and the further plans we have for sustainable cost reductions should all be supportive of achieving 2018 expected results.<br>
Let me now focus on the quarter. As Doug said, and I will reiterate given its importance, total company adjusted EBITDA was $573 million in the<br>quarter. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 360 basis points to 15.6% despite a revenue decline of 16%. This is the result<br>of good project execution and incremental cost savings. Our execution both in our Onshore/Offshore and Subsea projects supported the margin<br>performance in the quarter and full year. Improving activity levels in Surface Americas and the benefit of the restructuring initiative and client-focused<br>actions demonstrated the leverage in our North American land business. We believe these quarterly results are another example of our improving<br>operational performance.<br>
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the quarter were $0.20 when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.53<br>per diluted share. These charges and credits totaled $245 million, including the impact of tax reform. We have provided more detail for these items<br>in the accompanying schedules to our release. We incurred $138 million of charges related to tax reform in the quarter, most of which was related<br>to U.S. tax reform. When you exclude these charges and other discrete items, the effective tax rate in Q4 was approximately 33%. Also recorded in<br>the quarter was $91 million of additional liability related to our joint venture partners that was recorded within net interest expense. We ended<br>the quarter with net cash of $2.9 billion.<br>
Looking more closely at the segment highlights. Subsea EBITDA margins showed resilience against a significant top line reduction, declining just<br>70 basis points with revenue down 36%. The strength in margins reflect strong project execution and the cost-reduction initiative that helped<br>mitigate the negative impact of the reduced project activity. Subsea backlog increased sequentially to $6.2 billion, achieving our strongest<br>book-to-bill of the recovery cycle so far at over 1.3. And $3.4 billion of this backlog can be executed in 2018.<br>
Onshore/Offshore posted very strong adjusted EBITDA margin performance of 14.6%, benefiting from the realization of key milestones on several<br>major projects and from projects with net favorable commercial closeouts. This also reduces risks looking forward.<br>
In the quarter, we announced the award for the BAPCO Refinery Expansion project. This award will be reflected in our first quarter inbound. Similar<br>to the treatment of the Coral FLNG project award, we will not fully consolidate the financial results as we are not the majority owner of the joint<br>venture. However, this project has significant economic value for our Onshore/Offshore operations.<br>
Inbound orders of nearly $900 million in the period were mostly made up of a collection of smaller awards. As we foreshadowed last quarter, we<br>saw the potential for large project inbound in the coming quarters.<br>
Moving to Surface Technologies. Margins increased more than 1,400 basis points to 20.4%. Revenues increased nearly 23% from the prior year<br>period. The significant year-over-year improvement in surface reflects the sharp recovery in the North American land market, strong operational<br>leverage on a restructured cost base, and some pricing improvements. We expect that our product offering and integrated model will further<br>improve the top line in 2018. In comparison, international markets were largely stable with continued pricing pressures in some regions.<br>
Turning to guidance. We provided preliminary segment guidance for our 2018 with our Q3 results in October. Today, we are confirming segment<br>guidance for Subsea and Surface Technologies while raising Onshore/Offshore EBITDA margin guidance. Please note that this guidance includes<br>the effect of merger synergies expected to be realized in 2018 and excludes all charges and credits.<br>

<hr>
<A name=605></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:00PM, FTI.N - Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call<br>
Let me now provide some additional thoughts on a few of the new and updated guidance items. First, in Onshore/Offshore, we are raising EBITDA<br>margin guidance to at least 10.5% from at least 9.5%. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved sequentially throughout 2017, with notable strength in<br>Q4 that was driven by strong execution as well as favorable completion on several projects in the quarter. While it may be difficult to match this<br>performance throughout 2018, we are further adjusting our margin expectations higher on the continued strength of our operational performance.<br>Our revenue expectations for Onshore/Offshore remain the same and incorporate a lower contribution from Yamal LNG. We remain confident in<br>the execution of our backlog.<br>
Turning to corporate expense. We are seeing the benefit of corporate synergies, and therefore, expect corporate cost in a range of $40 million to<br>$45 million per quarter, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. While much of our merger integration work is complete, the majority<br>of the expected $100 million in spending is for further restructuring efforts in 2018. With respect to our guidance for tax, we now expect our tax<br>rate for 2018 to fall in the range of 28% to 32%. Earnings mix should revert to lower rate tax jurisdictions as a result of both business mix and an<br>anticipated reduction in project cost in lower tax regions, where such losses have no offsetting tax benefit.<br>
Much of the tax-related restructuring work initiated since the merger close has now been completed. While the benefits of this work are reflected<br>within our guidance, we do anticipate some additional improvement in 2019 before contemplating the effects of any change in earnings mix. The<br>remaining guidance items are all outlined on slide 12 of the earnings call presentation and in the earnings release.<br>
The fourth quarter concluded a successful first year of TechnipFMC. While our focus is clearly on the opportunity for 2018 and beyond, some of<br>the accomplishments made in our first year should serve as catalyst to our longer-term plans. Our risk management discipline contributed to strong<br>project execution in both Subsea and Onshore/Offshore segments. All of our operations performed well, meeting or exceeding operational margin<br>performance while identifying cost-reduction opportunities for the benefit of future periods. This remains a focus for us today. And our organization<br>delivered synergies ahead of our plan for $200 million in 2017, and we have raised the total savings target to $450 million in annualized savings<br>by the end of 2018. We commenced our capital allocation plan, taking a disciplined and balanced approach toward business investment and<br>shareholder distributions. We remain committed to repurchasing the full authorization of up to $500 million in ordinary shares no later than the<br>end of 2018. In addition, the company's Board of Directors has once again authorized and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13. We focus<br>our actions in 2018 with confidence in the objective we control, confidence in future market penetration of our commercial models and new<br>technologies and confidence on our execution and project delivery performance, plus the achievement of synergies and cost targets with sustainable<br>cost benefit. We think these items form the major building blocks from which we will create shareholder value.<br>
Operator, you may open the call for questions.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons.<br>
<b>Bill Herbert</b> - Simmons &amp; Company International, Research Division - MD, Head of Energy Research &amp; Senior Research Analyst of Oil Service<br>
So Maryann, I was curious with regard to the components of Subsea revenue in 2017, especially Book &amp; Turn and service and what you expect<br>those to be in 2018.<br>
<b>Maryann T. Mannen</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CFO and EVP<br>
Yes, thanks, Bill. So as we have previously mentioned, our service revenue from 2017 and 2018, we really don't expect much change. We've talked<br>about that being in the range of about $1.4 billion services. So the lion's share of the change from 2017 revenues to 2018 is driven by our project<br>revenues.<br>

<A name=606></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:00PM, FTI.N - Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call<br>
<b>Bill Herbert</b> - Simmons &amp; Company International, Research Division - MD, Head of Energy Research &amp; Senior Research Analyst of Oil Service<br>
Okay. And with regard to Book &amp; Turn?<br>
<b>Maryann T. Mannen</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CFO and EVP<br>
So as you see, we've got about $3.4 billion in our backlog that is executable for 2018. And then if you will assume roughly another $1 billion in<br>services, that would say we need about $800 million in what we would consider Book &amp; Turn or revenues that will come from new inbound in 2018.<br>
<b>Bill Herbert</b> - Simmons &amp; Company International, Research Division - MD, Head of Energy Research &amp; Senior Research Analyst of Oil Service<br>
Okay. And secondly for me, Doug, with regard to LNG FIDs. What are you tracking now in terms of numbers? And how many industry awards,<br>roughly speaking, would you expect for each, 2018 and 2019, with the backdrop of less than a handful effectively have been awarded over the last<br>2 years?<br>
<b>Douglas J. Pferdehirt</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CEO and Director<br>
Thank you for the question, Bill. So let's go from the beginning. In terms of the concept work that we're doing through our Genesis team, as noted<br>in my prepared remarks, their activity level has really accelerated and is quite high right now. I'd prefer not to give out exact counts, but it has<br>certainly seen a significant recovery from where we were over the last couple of years. In terms of active LNG FEED studies, some, as we've -- I talked<br>about in my prepared remarks, I did not mention the Arctic LNG 2 FEED study that we have previously discussed on the earnings call as that<br>continues to progress right well -- quite well, as well as we've talked about the potential on some of our existing terrestrial LNG facilities, the<br>opportunity to add additional trains. So that work is going on, on the, let's say, on the Onshore portion. On the Offshore portion, there's actually a<br>few FEED studies going on. Some of them are around some of the big new discoveries. I'd rather let the operators comment than myself. But there's<br>some associated gas on some of these larger new oil discoveries in these new regions. And one option to address the associated gas would be to<br>introduce FLNG into those projects. In terms of the timing of projects in 2018/2019, Bill, I think you represented it well. We have been in a period<br>of oversupply in LNG. There are, by most expectations, that should come into balance around 2025, which would mean if you want a FID and FLNG,<br>which is a 60-month delivery or terrestrial project, which is closer to 7 years, it puts you into that time frame of '18, '19, '20, I'm needing to start to<br>see some FIDs move forward. So we're seeing it on the concept. We're seeing it flow through to the FEED. And as I highlighted in my prepared<br>remarks, we see some of the larger projects now being discussed and actually shortlisting the amount of companies that are going to be participating<br>in those going forward. The actual timing to the award though, as you know, these are large projects. The timing tends to be a bit fluid, so I'd hate<br>to predict if it's going to be '18 or '19 or how many are actually going to occur. But we do see a ramp-up in activity and do expect to see some<br>additional LNG awards in the coming years.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Brown from Cr�dit Suisse.<br>
<b>Gregory Brown</b> - Cr�dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Firstly then, in the LNG market, you mentioned LNG Canada and the operator group has suggested that yourselves in partnership with KBR and<br>another consortium have been invited to bid for lump sum EPC contract. It was obviously a very large opportunity, but you've also mentioned the<br>risk management. I was wondering if you'd be able to comment on your appetite to take on such a project on a lump-sum basis and how you<br>would intend to assess the risk involved? That's the first question. And on the second one, perhaps on Subsea. Are you seeing any sort of a trend<br>whereby aftermarket or services work is bundled into an additional order? I guess that's part of your integrated life of field offering. So are you<br>seeing any positive momentum there?<br>

<A name=607></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:00PM, FTI.N - Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call<br>
<b>Douglas J. Pferdehirt</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CEO and Director<br>
Thank you, Gregory, for the questions. So I'll take them in the order that you presented them. So we have a very robust process in terms of the<br>selectivity around the types of projects, the projects and the types of commercial models that we will accept on projects. And you'll see over a<br>period of time, as we've demonstrated at our Analyst [Day] event just back in November, that we moved our portfolio from being predominantly<br>lump sum, turnkey projects to really introducing a much more robust reimbursable or services component to our Onshore/Offshore portfolio. And<br>we're really quite proud of that, really supported by the strength of our process technologies group and the differentiation that, that brings as well<br>as our project management consulting, both of which drive a large portion of our service or our reimbursable activities. The contract that you<br>mentioned, the LNG Canada, indeed, we've been shortlisted. We're very excited about the project. We're working closely with the customer, and<br>we believe that there's a lot of learnings that we could bring to make that project successful both in the use of the fabrication of mega modules<br>and a lot of the work that we've done on other recent LNG terrestrial projects that we're currently working on. So we think we have a lot to bring<br>to that project. I will maybe correct you on the lump-sum turnkey portion of that. This is a contract that's still under discussion. There's still discussions<br>between us and the customer in terms of which portion of the contract, if any, would be taken as a lump-sum turnkey portion. It would be reasonable<br>to expect that a portion of the contract would be lump-sum turnkey. It is not reasonable to expect that the full contract would be lump-sum turnkey,<br>but that's a discussion, an ongoing discussion we're having with the client. In terms of some Subsea and Subsea services and the bundling, there's<br>really 2 components. Typically, the activity you're associated with the project, or if you will, the installation of the equipment, the initial installation<br>of the equipment indeed tends to be part of the initial project and part of the scope of that project. But it's important to understand that we have<br>over 50% of the installed base of all Subsea equipment in the world as TechnipFMCs. It requires ongoing inspection maintenance and repair,<br>upgrading, et cetera. There's automation and control systems that naturally need to have firmware and software upgrades. All of these types of<br>things are on a reoccurring basis and not normally part of that original contract. So it really depends how you look at the Subsea services. Again,<br>the initial phase, the installation is typically part of it. But as we continue to grow and expand our offerings around Subsea services, some of them<br>would -- could be bundled as part of the initial integrated offering, but many of them will end up being call-up services. For instance, if the Subsea<br>well is in need of intervention, nothing to do with the Subsea equipment, the wellbore itself, maybe there's a failure in the sand screen or maybe<br>there's some other problem with the downhole, part of the downhole completion, the only way to access those Subsea wells is by using a company<br>like ourselves. And we're the market leader in Subsea well intervention, to be able to go out and be able to provide those services so that you can<br>reenter those Subsea wells.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan.<br>
<b>Sean Meakim</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
So Doug, just to start, I think we talked about the Subsea margin trajectory, just considering the strong performance in the fourth quarter, we've<br>talked before about expectations for some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But how should that 4Q result guide investor expectations for the trajectory<br>between first half and second half '18? Then I guess the other thing I was thinking about in that context is how should we think about the margin<br>outlook relative to the guidance band for revenue that you've offered? I mean, effectively, higher end of the revenue, should we think about at<br>being positively correlated with the margin or negatively correlated? Just can you say anything about that flex within the guidance band?<br>
<b>Douglas J. Pferdehirt</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CEO and Director<br>
Okay, Sean, thank you. So indeed, we're very proud of the performance in -- of our Subsea -- across all 3 operating segments, but as you pointed<br>out specifically in subsea in the fourth quarter. And I realized that in the context of the guidance of our 2018 even made it more -- even put more<br>focus on it. But it is important to point out, and we've said it before, there are headwinds as we transition and start to move from the existing<br>backlog in the inbound. We're very happy with the inbound in 2017. We'll start to see some of that flow through in 2018. We need to maintain the<br>competencies and the capabilities to continue to deliver world-class projects to our customers. And therefore, we will continue to ensure that we<br>have the right workforce and assets to be able to manage that going into 2018 and beyond. We've talked a bit about the utilization of our fleet,<br>

<A name=608></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:00PM, FTI.N - Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call<br>
and there will be some softness as we transition into a greater SURF activity, which tends to come late -- at a later stage in the life cycle of the<br>project. You see the equipment side first and then the SURF-side a little bit later. So those are some of the headwinds that we face and why we<br>think that the margin guidance that we provided for 2018 is the appropriate margin guidance. In terms of the sequencing of it, I'd rather not get<br>into attempting to do quarterly guidance because so much of it really comes down to projects and project milestones. And when we achieve and<br>close out certain projects in a successful manner, that can have an impact as it did, by the way, in the fourth quarter of 2017. It is important to note<br>though and has been historical, the first quarter is always a soft quarter, and that mainly has to do with the weather associated with many of the<br>areas that we operate our fleet. And therefore, we'll see less activity in our Riserless Light Well Intervention activity that I was referring to earlier on<br>Gregory's question, indeed is very soft in the first quarter as is historical. It picks up and hits its stride in Q2 and Q3. So indeed, we would expect a<br>step-down in the first quarter. And in terms of the band relative to the revenue, I was going to let Maryann add some additional color on that<br>comment.<br>
<b>Maryann T. Mannen</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CFO and EVP<br>
Sean, thank you. So maybe just a few other comments to add to Doug. Keep in mind, we -- as Doug said earlier, we had planned for the inflection<br>point in 2016 to see the recovery of Subsea, and timing has a critical element attached to our margin performance. Obviously, the sooner we get<br>inbound in, the faster we can execute. The later we get it, obviously the bit of a challenge to get it executed in a given year. One of the things that<br>we've said is that we want to be sure that we retain all of the core competencies of our ongoing project management and our engineering<br>organization. So we see that backlog growing. As Doug reiterated on his comments here this morning, we expect '18 to be another positive year<br>with respect to Subsea inbound. So the timing of that, the sooner we get inbound, our ability to leverage that inbound improves, we could see<br>some positive momentum around the margins. And the other thing is we also talked about our investment in R&amp;D to maintain our technology<br>development, and that's certainly a part of our 2018 guidance as well.<br>
<b>Sean Meakim</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Great. Just one more on Subsea, if I could. Just thinking about the Subsea 2.0 customer reception and plans for commercialization this quarter. Can<br>you maybe give us an update on getting the first set of equipment wet, how that's progressing and what we should expect going forward beyond<br>that?<br>
<b>Douglas J. Pferdehirt</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CEO and Director<br>
Thank you, Sean. And it's important to note, when we talk about the next generation of Subsea equipment, as we had a chance to demonstrate<br>first hand at our Analyst [Day] event in November, it's about making it real. Everybody can talk about things that they're doing. Ours is real. It has<br>been -- as we talked about at the Analyst [Day] event, it was there live and in person. And most importantly, we have already begun to receive<br>orders. As we indicated at the Analyst Day, we had not put the full suite of offering to the market. I'm very happy to say today that I can report that<br>we received our first order for our automation and control, our new automation and controls, our next-generation automation and control system.<br>We had previously informed the group that we had the first orders on the trees, and I don't remember if we said 8, 9 or 10, but it's in -- it continues<br>to grow our orders for our new compact robotic manifold. So we're now able to actively bid that entire suite to your point, Sean, and we're very<br>excited about the impact that, that will have on the tenders that we're currently submitting. Up until now, we have not been able to tender that<br>entire offering because we were still going through qualification and -- well, just, yes, qualification and testing. That's now complete. We're in the<br>process, the manifolds, as we discussed back in November. Or there, the tree will be installed very soon. And now we have the commitment on<br>the next-generation automation and control. And we always said it's as much about time as it is about cost, and it's just stunning. The next-generation<br>automation and control system, we're going to be able to do this in terms of months, not in terms of years in terms of being able to respond to the<br>customer. And the customer need really making a long-cycle business, a short-cycle business.<br>

<A name=609></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:00PM, FTI.N - Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call<br>
<b>Rob Pulleyn</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Three questions, if I may. The first one is, if we look at what's happening in the Subsea installation market, whereby, including yourselves, the<br>industry is installing projects, which were sanctioned at the tail end of the last cycle. And yet we also hear that the new raft of projects essentially<br>are becoming much shorter in lead time, shorter from FID to first oil. Surely, that also means that the time between FID and when the vessels are<br>needed also will be a lot faster. Is that leading to any bunching effect whereby key-enabling vessels, both in your fleets and your competitors, are<br>busy, and yet actually these inbound orders and the projects you see require these vessels, and that's creating actually some tightness maybe<br>ahead of expectations and the installation market? The second and third questions, please, to Maryann are a little bit on the housekeeping side.<br>Could you possibly give us a bit of a steer on the working capital move to 2018, which will clearly be a key driver of free cash flow? And finally, in<br>terms of the U.S. tax reform, obviously, we saw the charge. Given you're already planning a significant improvement in the tax effect and that seems<br>to be captured in 2018 guidance, should we expect any further improvements in the tax range beyond 2018?<br>
<b>Douglas J. Pferdehirt</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CEO and Director<br>
Okay, Rob, I'll take the first one then. Actually, quite an intriguing insight. Clearly, if you make a long-cycle business short-cycle, if you are able to<br>deliver the Subsea equipment as we described, in some cases, in 10 months versus 24 months, and now as TechnipFMC, the only Subsea company<br>that can deliver the equipment installed and commissioned on the seafloor, what you are describing is indeed a new reality in the business. The<br>good news is we have that visibility because we're the ones doing the integrated FEED studies. So we have an idea where are those shorter-cycle<br>opportunities. We build that into our roadmap. Clearly, we will prioritize the iEPCITM opportunities that we have to where we can do the fully<br>integrated Subsea system installed on the seafloor. Speaking more broadly for the market, I don't think that the market is necessarily tight at this<br>point, to be blunt. I think that what's your pointing out is that the tightness could occur sooner than most people anticipate, and I think that's a<br>fair statement.<br>
<b>Maryann T. Mannen</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CFO and EVP<br>
And rob, Maryann here. So first question, working capital. For 2018, we do not expect to see the same level of working capital use as we did in 2017,<br>in part because many of our projects are obviously coming to significant completion, but also because of the inbound that we're expecting. We're<br>also assuming that we will see incremental milestones in advance payments. So I would estimate somewhere in the range of about 50% of the<br>working capital use that we saw in 2017. Your second question was around U.S. tax reform, and I will tell you, for TechnipFMC, the U.S. tax reform<br>is a net benefit. It's a plus. First and foremost, as you saw in the release, our charge is a noncash charge. Much of the restructuring work that we've<br>been sharing with you was completed by the end of October, and so our tax adjustment that was reported is really a noncash charge. We were<br>able to benefit from most of the work that we'd done with the restructuring or what we call the &quot;out from under&quot; net operating losses in the U.S.<br>as well as foreign tax credits. So as we increase the amount of North American income, Doug talked about the strength in the North American<br>market recovering to similar peaks of '14 and the leverage that we're seeing, this will be a net benefit. So in other words, what we normally would<br>pay only on U.S. income at a 35% tax rate, we'll now pay a 21%. So as that North American income improves, we would expect to see incremental<br>benefit going forward.<br>
<b>Rob Pulleyn</b> - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Analyst<br>
That's extremely helpful. And just one follow-up, if I may, very quickly. When we think about the Yamal project and the cost-plus component, which<br>is not entirely called into backlog, I was just wondering whether you could quantify how much of that is still outstanding given the progress that's<br>actually been made on the construction of the second and third trains, if possible.<br>
<b>Maryann T. Mannen</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CFO and EVP<br>
Sure. So we are through Phase 1, which includes obviously all the modularization as well as the first train. And as you know, we're happy to announce,<br>of course, the successful start-up of first -- of Train 1 and first cargo. So what's remaining is Train 2 and Train 3. In the backlog that you see reported<br>

for the Onshore/Offshore business, a total of about $6,369 million at the end of 12/31/2017, you can see a big portion of that, about $4.2 billion, is<br>recognizable in '18. And obviously, there is much of that backlog that is associated with Yamal. Having said that, there's still portions of reimbursable<br>scope associated with Yamal that could help influence revenue in 2018. Because Train 2 and Train 3 are left, we still have revenues in the backlog<br>both for 2019 and a portion for 2020 currently in our $6.4 billion backlog.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of from Bertrand Hod�e from Kepler Cheuvreux.<br>
<b>Bertrand Hod�e</b> - Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division - Head of Oil and Gas Sector Research<br>
Two questions, if I may. The first is on the next generation of LNG, FLNG technologies that you're putting in place. Can you give us a flavor of what<br>is at stake here and what are the potential benefits for the clients? And second question relates to iEPCITM momentum. Can you disclose what was<br>the amount of order intake that was linked to iEPCITM in 2017? So out of the $5.1 billion Subsea order intake, how much related to iEPCITM?<br>
<b>Douglas J. Pferdehirt</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CEO and Director<br>
Bertrand, thank you for the questions. So in terms of the next-generation LNG, FLNG, obviously, different applications, being offshore and terrestrial,<br>but the objective remains the same, which is to achieve, as we are in the rest of our 2.0 portfolio and the vision for our company, to drive the project<br>economics by driving towards simplification, more system integration as well as new technologies that will result in a 50% reduction. So here, we're<br>talking about really driving towards being able to deliver LNG projects at a much lower cost, and therefore, a much more improved project<br>economics, be it from 2,000 metric ton down to 1,000 metric ton, which will bring LNG, particularly FLNG, into a completely new market, one that<br>I inferred earlier, which we market where there's associated gas with oil developments, which today would not bear the cost because of the reserve<br>capacity for the current scale of FLNG. So that's one example of what we're working on there. In terms of iEPCITM in 2017, it was not a material portion.<br>Again, it was -- the company was created in 2017. We were early in the conversion of integrated FEEDs to integrated EPCI. We didn't have that<br>many opportunities. What we have said though is that by our second year of operation, which is this year 2018, we expect that to approach 25%<br>of our total inbound will come from this new integrated model. Why is that important? These are direct awards, so we're not in the competitive<br>marketplace. And it's also our ability to get engaged early through the integrated FEED, demonstrate to our customer the value of our integrated<br>business model as well as our new technologies and then go into direct award for the execution phase of the project. This is unique to us and<br>creates an opportunity set that others do not have access to.<br>

Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC.<br>
<b>Kurt Hallead</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Co-Head of Global Energy Research and Analyst<br>
So I want to just maybe follow up a little bit on the -- you mentioned earlier in your prepared commentary, Doug, about high degree of enthusiasm<br>for the Subsea 2.0. Just wondering, post your Analyst Day that you had in November to where we are now, is there some additional color or<br>commentary that you may provide around potential timing of, well, additional awards for the projects that relate specifically to Subsea 2.0?<br>
<b>Douglas J. Pferdehirt</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CEO and Director<br>
Okay, I'll try to be brief, but you know this, I can get pretty excited on this question, so and I'm going to do my best. Understand that prior to the<br>Analyst Day, we had taken every major Subsea client, and in many cases, their Executive team through the technology demonstration area that<br>you were able to see back at the Analyst [Day] event. So we -- they've been aware of it for some time. They've been looking at it. We've been,<br>

therefore, setting up qualification programs with different clients or collectively with groups of clients, which is certainly the more efficient way to<br>go about it, and we're past that. And that's a challenging Subsea, it takes quite a bit of time to go from the concept and the idea to really having<br>something qualified to be able to use in the Subsea environment. As we stated at the Analyst Day, the manifold was completed. The tree was near<br>completion, and we had, had our first order and we're looking forward to actually the installation of that in short order. Indeed, that's moving<br>forward and will happen in the coming quarters. What is new from the Analyst Day was that the next-generation automation, which is actually a<br>significant step change, it really changes our entire operating model and makes it much more efficient for us as well, has now been -- we've now<br>received that award, and we'll be going to what's called TR level 4 and 5 as a result of that very soon. That now allows us to take that complete<br>package, including the access now to the flexible jumpers to be able to move towards our vision as we demonstrated at the Analyst Day.<br>
<b>Kurt Hallead</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Co-Head of Global Energy Research and Analyst<br>
That's great color. I appreciate that, Doug. And then maybe one follow-up I have for Maryann. So I appreciate the transparency on all the guidance<br>provided. And we look at the Onshore/Offshore business, obviously that went up. But I think -- just wanted to get a general sense like longer term,<br>do you think that there is going to be outside of the Yamal project and the benefit that's providing? Are you guys kind of thinking about the<br>longer-term margin dynamics in that business? I think historically, you guys just don't think about 10%, think about more like 5% or 6% kind of<br>margins. But I'm just wondering if execution, your excellence in execution really kind of alters your view on how you can drive margins in that<br>business.<br>
<b>Maryann T. Mannen</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CFO and EVP<br>
Yes, thanks, Kurt. Over the next couple of years, we -- as I mentioned, we've got work left to do on Yamal. But when we think about beyond that<br>time period, we are really trying to continue to capitalize on the strengths of the risk management approach. If you look historically, even in the<br>prior years, without as much revenue coming from Yamal, the execution has been good and the margins really better than -- are competitive --<br>better than the competitive landscape. When we think about going forward, our approach is really to try to continue to change the amount of<br>lump sum and focus more on reimbursable scope. You saw from Analyst Day how we've already become that movement. Second, we are really<br>looking for that opportunity to improve margins beyond that time period. We've said that we think margins in the range of 5% to 6% EBITDA are<br>clearly a target, and we'll continue to work diligently to ensure that that's sustainable beyond that time period. But we feel good about our ability<br>to deliver that, post the completion of Yamal.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from the line of Amy Wong from UBS.<br>
<b>Amy Wong</b> - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Analyst<br>
Two questions for me, please. First one is, one of your Subsea competitors just acquired a majority stake in early energy consulting business and<br>all in the name of providing -- getting in early to engagement with their clients. So kind of just get -- can we have some of your thoughts in terms<br>of TechnipFMC's position in terms of providing that integrated solution? How do you differentiate your offering, please? And do you see a threat<br>of your competitors trying to replicate your offering? How would you react with -- to that, please?<br>
<b>Douglas J. Pferdehirt</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CEO and Director<br>
Thank you for the question, Amy. So I'll do this, the second one, and then I'll go back to the first one. To be very blunt, I would be quite surprised<br>if our competitors did not try to emulate what has been created with TechnipFMC. We've talked about 25% of our inbound in 2018 coming from<br>this new integrated model. It's clearly having a level of market acceptance that I think far exceeded anyone's expectation because it's delivering<br>real substantive and sustainable change needed in the industry. So actually, I would be surprised to the opposite if someone did not react. In terms<br>of the actual transaction that you referenced, it's important to note that we have Genesis. Genesis is our agnostic front-end concept and front-end<br>

engineering organization. It is extremely well known in the market. We have a phenomenal group of people within our Genesis team, and we are<br>an industry leader. So just to put it in perspective, our Genesis organization is twice the size of the other organization that you were referencing.<br>So again, no surprise that others are trying to emulate, but it's going to be very difficult. What was created with TechnipFMC by just bringing<br>together 2 companies will not be possible by the combination of any other 2 companies. So we're a year into it. Second year of operation, we're<br>seeing 25% of our revenue come from this new integrated model. Integrations take time and integrations have challenges, and we're well on our<br>way in operating and continue to maintain a strong focus both on execution as well as the safety and wellbeing of our workforce. So I couldn't be<br>more proud of where we were, and I'm awful glad we went first.<br>
<b>Amy Wong</b> - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Analyst<br>
Could I just -- I just have a quick follow-up also on your Subsea business, and this time just focusing a little bit on your flexible pipes business<br>because we're really losing any kind of granularity in that. And I know you guys are always reluctant to give any specific metric, but could you give<br>some indication on activity levels in 2018 versus 2017 on your flexible pipes business? How loaded up are your manufacturing plants, please?<br>
<b>Douglas J. Pferdehirt</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CEO and Director<br>
Yes, the -- it's one of the interesting parts of our business that's may be a little countercyclical to some of the other parts of our business, in that<br>the activity level will actually be up in 2018 versus 2017. That's a result of several key project awards from our largest customer, which is Petrobras,<br>but also due to other awards that we're receiving and the influence that iEPCITM has on our flexibles business. The flexibles and the application of<br>flexibles is very intricate and integral to our integrated offering. So when you hear us talking about integrated EPCI, indeed, we're creating additional<br>market for our flexibles offering as well. There's a lot of we can do on the technology side, and you should expect to hear more from us through<br>2018 and what we're going to do to drive to a future of flexibles 2.0.<br>
Your last question comes from the line of Byron Pope from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.<br>
<b>Byron Pope</b> - Tudor, Pickering, Holt &amp; Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD of Oil Service Research<br>
Doug, I was wondering if could -- needed you to provide some additional color on one of the Subsea industry trends that you touched on, which<br>is the growing prominence of independents. And naturally, the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea come to mind as 2 of those markets where you might be<br>seeing that trend. But as you look out on the horizon over the next couple of years, could you speak to some of the Subsea areas, regions where<br>you see that growing prominence of independents?<br>
<b>Douglas J. Pferdehirt</b> - TechnipFMC plc - CEO and Director<br>
Sure. Thank you, Byron, and I appreciate your patience. So clearly, we have seen the first movement. If you go back in time, it really first occurred<br>in the Gulf of Mexico, and we have some very strong long-term relationships with independents in the Gulf of Mexico, more -- and I would say and<br>also the U.K. sector, the North Sea. More recently, we're seeing the Norwegian sector of the North Sea where we have been very successful at<br>aligning with the new operators, who we think -- and we're just a natural -- we're a natural partner for those type of projects because of our ability<br>to be able to provide the full integrated Subsea system. We're also seeing from a private equity point of view and from other small independents<br>movement in other parts of the world, be it the Mediterranean or be it in Asia Pacific. And there, it's very interesting. And again, we -- because of<br>our relationship, because of the way that we have, we always form deep intimate relationships with our customers, very transparent and very --<br>with a high track record of success in terms of delivering on the projects that we say we'll deliver on at the price we say we'll deliver on. I think we<br>just built -- the brand is quite strong and quite important in that area. Going forward, I think we'll see more of those types of awards. I would expect<br>those type of awards to also influence our iEPCITM in a very positive way as well as you could see awards where we may be offer even beyond just<br>the traditional integrated Subsea and include the FPSO or additional production capability because of the unique footprint of TechnipFMC.<br>

<A name=616></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:00PM, SM - Q4 2017 and Full Year SM Energy Co Q&amp;A Discussion<br>
<b>Javan D. Ottoson</b> - SM Energy Company - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thank you, David. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us. I recognize that we released a lot of material last night and there's a lot there to digest.<br>So I very much appreciate you taking the time to call in today.<br>
I do have one introductory comment before I open the floor for questions. Over the past year or so I've spent a lot of time talking to people who've<br>been disillusioned with investing in the oil and gas space because they believe industry management teams don't really care much about making<br>high returns on capital. My response to that concern is always that we agree with that. And that SM Energy's singular focus on achieving top-tier<br>returns as a measure of success in our business currently has us on a path of demonstrating a very high rate of change in the improvement of our<br>business relative to our peers.<br>
I listened to our recorded call notes again and I'm sure we must have said 50 times that we focus on achieving high returns as measured by growth<br>and cash flow per debt adjusted share. And that is how we have built our business plan, a plan that achieves about a 35% cash flow per debt<br>adjusted share growth rate over the next several years. To be clear, production is an output from that planning process, not an input.<br>
We have never had a production growth rate metric in our long-term incentive plans here at SM. And even though we've averaged over a 98.5%<br>approval rate on our say-on-pay votes over the last 5 years, we are going to modify our long-term incentive plan metrics this year to explicitly<br>include cash flow growth per debt adjusted share as a key performance measurement. We'll be disclosing more about that in our upcoming proxy.<br>
So with that, I'll open the floor for questions.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) And our first questioner today will be Michael Glick with JPMorgan.<br>
<b>Michael Adam Glick</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst<br>
Jay, could you talk a bit about the rationale behind the deceleration in the rig and crude count in the Permian as you move through the year and<br>perhaps its implications on 2019?<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Michael, this is Herb. I'll take that one. So you're probably aware we've been getting quite a bit more efficient on our rig rate drilling, how fast we're<br>drilling. And for example, what we would drill with 11 rigs in 2016, we can do with 8.5 rigs this year. And we also are going to large pads with<br>co-development. And by doing that, we wind up with a large number of DUCs at a certain time and then we complete them and we bring them<br>all online pretty quickly. So what you'll see is a large increase in the DUC count at the end of '18. And shortly thereafter, in '19, we bring those all<br>online. So we'll be spending completion dollars in '18 for a bunch of wells that come on in '19. I think -- does that answer the question for you?<br>
<b>Michael Adam Glick</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst<br>
Yes, I think so. And then also, Herb, maybe you could talk about that Sundown pad and how well performance, particularly in the Wolfcamp B, is<br>comparing to that Viper well?<br>

<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Okay. So it's still relatively early compared to the Viper experience. But the IP was quite good on that Wolfcamp B. It reaffirmed our views from that<br>Eastland well that Apache had drilled just to southwest of there. So it's on that same trend, which we see -- which is relatively low decline. We'll<br>see where it goes, but it's a strong well.<br>
<b>Michael Adam Glick</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst<br>
Yes, it is. And then lastly, could you talk about any noncore asset sales such as Halff East out there?<br>
<b>Javan D. Ottoson</b> - SM Energy Company - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, we look at the opportunity to core up all the time. We are exploring the idea of selling Halff East. Don't know if we'll get a number that we<br>like yet, and we'll let you know where that goes. We're kind of in that exploration phase at this point.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) And our next questioner today will be Brad Heffern with RBC Capital.<br>
<b>Bradley Barrett Heffern</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Associate<br>
Just as a follow-on on the Sundown wells, it looked like they used a tighter stage spacing than the other new Howard County well results. Can you<br>talk about why you did that and whether you think it had a meaningful impact on production?<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Brad, yes, you're right. We went with tighter stage spacing there. I think it's probably around 84 -- 82 to 84 stages in that well compared to -- so<br>effectively 125-foot stage spacing versus our standard 167. We've been trying that in a number of places. So we're trying to do direct offset<br>comparisons in some cases to see is the incremental investment in the additional stages worth it. So we're still in the testing stage on that. And<br>those Sundown wells, we applied it there. We also had that in the Viper well.<br>
<b>Bradley Barrett Heffern</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Associate<br>
Okay, got it. And then on the water handling front, you guys are obviously making some big investments this year. Understanding that you gave<br>some color around LOE sort of declining throughout the year, so it's come online. Can you give any sort of quantification as to what the scale of<br>the LOE decrease is from that?<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
No, I don't think we're really prepared to do that. Obviously, we're in the core areas where we're building out that infrastructure and then there's<br>other areas where we'll still be using third party. But yes, I wouldn't put a number on that yet. We're just in the building phase right now.<br>
<b>Bradley Barrett Heffern</b> - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Associate<br>
Okay. And then finally, can you just talk through service costs a little bit? I know the budget assumes 10% to 15% increase. Have we seen any sort<br>of stabilization in the market and just how is capacity looking in general?<br>

<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
So first of all, let me address the capacity question first. So we have not had any issues with capacity. We've got vendors lined out and we've been<br>using the same ones over and over again. They know our program, they know what to expect so that it can work quite effectively for them -- very<br>efficient for them. That goes to our rigs and our completion crews and then some of the ancillary services like cementing and logging. So we've<br>baked in a certain amount of escalation. Some of it is where we have no escalation, we've got firm contracts. And then some, there's some linkage<br>to prices where there's escalation based on certain price parameters. And we know those will be coming in and we baked those in. So bottom line<br>is availability looks good for us. And the escalation, we've baked in -- a lot of it is relatively firm for the first half of the year, and then we'll see where<br>the second half goes.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next questioner today will be Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna.<br>
<b>Biju Z. Perincheril</b> - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Can you talk a little bit about the Griswold pilot and the performance of those wells and how you're thinking about spacing in the Wolfcamp A on<br>that southeast part of your acreage?<br>
<b>Jennifer Martin Samuels</b> - SM Energy Company - VP of IR<br>
Biju, will you repeat the first part of that?<br>
<b>Biju Z. Perincheril</b> - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Yes. I was wondering if you could talk about the Griswold pilot and the performance of those wells and how you're thinking about development<br>spacing.<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Okay. So the Griswold, there's a few wells over there in that area, and those are on the periphery and there's a number that we've drilled over there<br>for our acreage holding. The real pilot areas for where we're downspacing that's like the Iceman pad would be an example, where we've gone<br>down to 500 -- sorry, 420-foot spacing there and stacked Wolfcamp A over -- Lower Spraberry over Wolfcamp A's. So we do have a spacing model<br>that we're using, so typically, 500, 660 feet in Wolfcamp A. That's really the -- what we've determined is optimal based on all the work we've done<br>in both Sweetie Peck and Rock [Ridge]. Is there something specific about the Griswold you wanted to know?<br>
<b>Biju Z. Perincheril</b> - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Analyst<br>
No. I was wondering -- I thought that was a 420-foot spacing test. Maybe I misunderstood that.<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Yes. And the Griswold -- let me just pull up the results there. Actually, what I'll do is I'll have Jennifer get back to you on that one.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next questioner today will be Chris Stevens with KeyBanc.<br>
<b>Chris Stevens</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
You gave us a 2018 rig cadence over the course of the year. You're going to enter 2019 with 7 rigs in the Permian, 1 in the Eagle Ford. How does<br>that activity trend through '19? Do you kind of keep that rig count flat there? And I guess, how much CapEx -- or directionally, how does that look<br>when you're assuming that you'll be free cash flow neutral by mid-2019?<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Yes. Our assumption for 2019 is we keep the activity relatively flattish, but you just have to watch the DUC count versus the rig count. As we get<br>more efficient, that can influence things considerably. But we have not provided capital guidance on that one.<br>
<b>Javan D. Ottoson</b> - SM Energy Company - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Directionally, it will be lower than '18.<br>
<b>Chris Stevens</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And so I guess, how many DUCs are you going to enter 2019 with? And how many of those will you be working down? I mean, are you going<br>to complete more wells in 2019 than in 2018?<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
I think the DUC count we provided at end of December is around 110 to 115.<br>
<b>Jennifer Martin Samuels</b> - SM Energy Company - VP of IR<br>
That's at Slide 34 that we give it by month. You can see the build at the end of the year.<br>
<b>Chris Stevens</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And so are you going to work that down pretty significantly in 2019?<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Yes. This is where it gets real lumpy. As we go to these 25 well type of co-developments, you see 25 wells come on in a very short period of time.<br>So then your DUC count drops within a month by 25 wells. And then you build it up again and [cut down]. So that's just what we've determined is<br>very much the optimal way of developing.<br>
<b>Chris Stevens</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay, got it. And just lastly for me, did you incorporate the in-basin sand cost savings into the 2018 CapEx budget? Or is there maybe some downside<br>if that comes in at some point in time?<br>

<A name=620></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:00PM, SM - Q4 2017 and Full Year SM Energy Co Q&amp;A Discussion<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Yes, there's some of it. I guess, the way to look at it is -- I just checked, last month, we ran about 20% local sand in our completions. And by the end<br>of the year, we hope to get to around 80%. So for the year, what the actual savings will be will depend on how quickly those local sand mines come<br>on. And we indicated that U.S. Silica has told us first quarter and third quarter, and they're on track for that. So that's really -- yes, there is an<br>opportunity to get more local sand to reduce further, but we've got something that's very reasonable baked into that plan.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) And our next questioner today will be Nitin Kumar with Deutsche Bank.<br>
<b>Nitin Kumar</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
If I can just go back to that Slide 34. As you exit this year, you're building about 30 additional DUCs, but you're reducing the rig count. What's a<br>normalized DUC count for your rig cadence right now?<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Okay, that's a tough one. I usually think of it in terms of frac spreads per rig. And that's usually the way -- and basically, you can see we run about<br>2:1. So 2 rigs per frac spread. And then how it actually moves through time is really pad dependent. If we do 2 well pads, they come on pretty<br>quickly. If we do 6 well and we do a number of 6 wells together to co-develop, then it's a different story.<br>
<b>Nitin Kumar</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
I'm sorry, what I meant to ask -- what I'm trying to say is how many DUCs is normal inventory? Let's say you were running 7 rigs through '19. How<br>many DUCs would you hold in normal inventory given normal operations?<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
I think you just run an average line through what we've got there, and that would be a pretty good indicator.<br>
<b>Nitin Kumar</b> - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And then can you maybe talk about -- you mentioned the Austin Chalk in the Eagle Ford. What are you seeing there and kind of what are<br>you looking for?<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Yes, there's 2 things on the Austin Chalk. First, we know a lot of other operators in the Eagle Ford have gone and test the Austin Chalk and had<br>some great results. Second piece of information is that we had 1 Eagle Ford well that was initially in the Eagle Ford for a good portion of the lateral<br>but then went up into the Austin Chalk. And we find that the condensate yield and NGL yields are higher in the Austin Chalk. So that's an attractive<br>economic proposition. Deliverability looked good, too. So we'll be testing that. It would be a potential big inventory add for us if we could add<br>another layer of Austin Chalk across our full acreage position.<br>

Would it command capital in '19 and '20 if you had success?<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Too early to say.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next questioner today will be Gregg Brody with Bank of America.<br>
<b>Gregg William Brody</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD<br>
With your PRB sale, you noted that you retained 20% of your acreage. What's your plan with that? And is that something that you would consider<br>developing down the line?<br>
<b>Javan D. Ottoson</b> - SM Energy Company - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
This is Javan. No, I think our plan would be to exit that acreage over time. Most of that acreage that's remaining is small dribs and drabs of things<br>in mineral interest, small interest in other wells. It's not a big, cohesive thing that we can really develop. So I think it would probably -- most of it<br>would probably get sold in auction processes or in small processes. And it will take quite a bit of time. None of it is operated to any significant<br>extent, so it wouldn't impact our ability to exit operationally.<br>
<b>Gregg William Brody</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD<br>
That's helpful. And then just other than the Bakken, what else is there that you could -- that you're considering selling? You kind of hinted at<br>continuing that with whatever's left. What else is...<br>
<b>Javan D. Ottoson</b> - SM Energy Company - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, as was mentioned earlier in the call, we're exploring the sale of Halff East, which is a nonoperated property we have in the Permian. We'll look<br>over time. We're not shy about selling things. And I think we're getting to the point where a lot of what we own has great inventory in it, and that<br>makes all those decisions more difficult. But certainly, we're going to continue looking at our portfolio every year and deciding whether it fits. Our<br>objective is to own top-tier assets. And if we can find ways to get better assets, we're always going to look for opportunities to trade up or do<br>whatever we need to do.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And our next questioner today will be Chris Stevens with KeyBanc.<br>
<b>Chris Stevens</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
I guess, how much additional facility in water infrastructure CapEx should we expect in 2019? And I guess, is that something you plan to keep<br>in-house? Or could that be potentially monetized at some point?<br>

<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Chris, yes, this is Herb. So for 2019, well, first let's get our backbone going in 2018. 2019, we'll have most of the backbone in there, and it will just<br>be a matter of whether we extend it from there. So no, we haven't really looked beyond that. And there's always the opportunity to sell a water<br>system if it makes sense.<br>
<b>Chris Stevens</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. So it's not necessarily something that you've built it with the intention of selling, it's just something that maybe opportunistically you would<br>evaluate?<br>
<b>Javan D. Ottoson</b> - SM Energy Company - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. Chris, it's Javan. We've done this before. We've built water systems in the Bakken and it's sold and then kind of had a leaseback arrangement.<br>And I think that makes sense to us. At this point in the development, having control of these assets has a lot to do with maintaining schedule. We<br>have great relationships with the landowners and everything we need to build these out. It just makes sense to us. When you run the economics,<br>it's just really a compelling story to go ahead and build these ourselves. And we can make the decision here in a year or 2 about, okay, do we need<br>to continue to own those or can we make a turn here by passing that on to someone else. So we'll make that decision. We can go either way. It's<br>certainly an opportunity. I think it's going to create a lot of economic value for us. And that's why we're willing to spend the capital over the next<br>12 months.<br>
<b>Chris Stevens</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay, got it. And I guess, in terms of the spacing, the wellbore spacing, how do you guys plan to go and develop Howard County in 2018? Is it going<br>to be all 660-foot spacing or are you going to do some 500-foot spacing on a portion of the acreage? And I guess, also if you can just kind of talk<br>about that in regards to your inventory at year-end '17. Does that include anything on -- tighter than 660-foot spacing?<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Yes. Chris, I will say we've got the -- Slide 33 shows kind of some of the assumptions. But I'll just go over a little bit more color on that. So yes, typically<br>in the Wolfcamp A, we're going to be between 513 and 660-foot spacing. There's -- some of the Wolfcamp B further to the east will be going to<br>wider spacing because it makes sense there. And then in Sweetie Peck, we'll still be doing some 420s. And typically, the Lower Spraberry in Sweetie<br>Peck will be 420 to 513-foot spacing. And that's just because of how thick Lower Spraberry is over there. Lower Spraberry will vary between 660<br>and 1,320 feet in the RockStar area.<br>
<b>Chris Stevens</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP &amp; Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay, got it. And just lastly for me, you guys are obviously seeing a lot of efficiency gains out there. What should we assume now for how many<br>wells a rig can now drill in a year?<br>
<b>Herbert S. Vogel</b> - SM Energy Company - EVP of Operations<br>
Okay. Here, I'll do it kind of the reverse. You can figure out the math here. We have a record well of -- I believe we did 1 10,000 foot lateral spud rig<br>release in 12.5 days. That's the record. But the average would be a little bit longer than that. So call it about -- yes, last 12 pads averaged 18.5 days<br>from spud of the first well in the pad to rig release on the last well. So -- and that's with 10,000-foot wells. So you can figure that's about 20 wells<br>per rig. Oh, yes, and you see the -- if we can get 18.5 down to 12.5, that's a lot of efficiency gains.<br>

<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call today.<br>
2017 was a good year for Stepan Company. The company delivered record reported and adjusted net income for 2017, and we now have had<br>record income for 7 of the last 10 years. Reported net income in 2017 was $91.6 million, up 6% versus last year despite the $14.9 million unfavorable<br>net impact of the new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's legislation.<br>
Adjusted net income was $108.7 million, 11% higher than 2016. Adjusted net income as a percent of net sales was 5.7%, an increase of 10 basis<br>points versus 2016.<br>
Improved product mix, increased asset utilization and enhanced internal efficiencies continued to drive results. Both Surfactants and Polymers<br>benefited from our diversification strategy, and we anticipate further contributions in 2018.<br>

<A name=626></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:00PM, SCL - Q4 2017 Stepan Co Earnings Call<br>
For the full year, Surfactants delivered record operating income due to an improved product mix, lower manufacturing costs and the accretive<br>impact of our 2016 Brazil acquisition. Sales benefited from our diversification efforts into Functional Products, higher sales within the household,<br>industrial and institutional end markets and continued growth in more specialized applications.<br>
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the company approved a plan to restructure a portion of our production activities at our Fieldsboro facility. We<br>transitioned impacted products to other Stepan sites in North America, and we expect to benefit from improved asset utilization and a reduced<br>cost base going forward.<br>
Polymers delivered its second best full year results despite increased competitive pressure and higher raw material costs within our North American<br>Polyol business. Global Polyol volumes were up slightly, despite share loss in North America. The market for insulation materials remains strong<br>due to continued global energy-conservation efforts.<br>
The definitive agreement with BASF to acquire its surfactant production facility in Ecatepec, Mexico is on track to close this quarter. We believe the<br>acquisition will significantly enhance our market position and supply capabilities for surfactants in Mexico and position us to grow in both the<br>consumer and functional end markets.<br>
Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on Stepan's common stock of $0.225 per share, payable on March 15, 2018.<br>
At this point, I would like Matt to walk through a few more details about our fourth quarter and full year results.<br>
<b>Matthew John Eaken</b> - Stepan Company - Corporate Controller, Interim VP &amp; CFO<br>
Thank you, Quinn. My comments will generally follow the slide presentation. Let's start with Slide #5 to recap the quarter. As Quinn stated, adjusted<br>net income for the fourth quarter 2017 was a record $24.6 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, a 100% increase versus $12.3 million, or $0.52 per<br>diluted share, in 2016. Because adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure, we provide full reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures<br>and these can be found in Appendix 2 of the presentation and Table 2 of the press release.<br>
Specifically, regarding adjustments to reported net income, this quarter included deferred compensation income of $1 million, or $0.04 per diluted<br>share, compared to deferred compensation expense of $2.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Naturally, all employee<br>compensation expenses are reflected in our normal operating income. However, we allow employees the opportunity to defer their incentive<br>payouts until some future date and the future payment changes based on the company's stock price. When the stock price declines, income is<br>generated as we mark this item to market value. Because the future liability of employee compensation only changes consistently with the change<br>in the stock price, we exclude this item from our operational discussion.<br>
The new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation resulted in a net onetime expense of $14.9 million, or $0.64 per diluted share. The current quarter<br>results also included $800,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, of after-tax business restructuring charges. These charges related to decommissioning<br>costs from the closure of our Canadian plant announced in 2016 and severance costs associated with the partial restructuring of our Fieldsboro<br>site. We expect an additional $2 million to $3 million of after-tax restructuring charges in 2018 related to decommissioning cost at these plants.<br>
Slide 6 shows the total company earnings bridge for the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, and breaks down the increase in<br>adjusted net income. Because this is net income, the figures noted here are on an after-tax basis. Fourth quarter 2016 results were negatively<br>impacted by $8.9 million of pretax nonrecurring costs, of which $8.3 million impacted Surfactants and $600,000 impacted Polymers. In addition,<br>fourth quarter 2017 results were positively impacted by $4.7 million of pretax income related to the favorable resolution of a Surfactant product<br>claim in Europe. We will cover each segment in more detail, but Surfactants and Polymers were up, while Specialty Products was down versus the<br>prior year.<br>
The bridge on Slide #6 excludes the impact of the new tax reform legislation because the onetime cost was excluded to arrive at adjusted net<br>income. Therefore, excluding the onetime impact, our effective tax rate did not significantly impact results for the quarter. For the full year, our<br>effective tax rate was 34.3% in 2017 compared to 24.3% in 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and<br>

Jobs Act, which resulted in a net tax cost of $14.9 million in 2017. The onetime net impact was comprised of a $19.4 million transition tax expense<br>on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a $4.5 million favorable impact related to the remeasurement of a net<br>U.S. deferred tax liabilities at a lower future corporate tax rate. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 was partially offset by favorable<br>nonrecurring discrete items.<br>
We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 23% in 2018.<br>
Our material on Slide #7 focuses solely on the Surfactant results of the segment for the fourth quarter. Surfactant net sales were $324.2 million, up<br>15% from the same quarter a year ago. Prices were 11% higher due to the pass-through of certain raw material costs. Sales volumes were up 2%,<br>mainly due to higher demand in the Functional Product end markets and higher sales through our distribution partners. This increase in volume<br>was partially offset by lower consumer product commodity volumes. The positive translation impact of a weaker U.S. dollar increased sales by the<br>remaining 2%. The segment delivered $28.3 million of operating income, a 94% increase over the prior year quarter, mainly driven by $8.3 million<br>of nonrecurring expenses in the prior year, settlement of a European product claim, savings from the Canadian plant shutdown and improved<br>product mix and growth in agriculture end markets in Europe. The prior year acquisition in Brazil also contributed positively.<br>
In the bridge, we showed North America and Asia in the same category because our Surfactant business in Asia is relatively small and much of the<br>Surfactant production in the region is used to support business in the United States. North American results were positively impacted by higher<br>demand for oilfield products, sales through our distribution channel as well as savings from the Canadian plant shutdown. Latin American results<br>were up slightly due to accretive income related to the Brazil acquisition in 2016. European results were higher year-over-year due to improved<br>product mix and growth in agricultural chemicals.<br>
The $11.4 million of nonrecurring costs primarily relate to the year-over-year impact of the Surfactant product claim commitments in Europe,<br>recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the positive impact due to the favorable resolution of one of the claims in the fourth quarter of 2017.<br>
Now turning to Polymers on Slide 8. Net sales were $131.1 million, up 13% from the same quarter a year ago. An 8% increase in selling prices was<br>related to the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Sales volume was up 1%, primarily due to higher European Rigid Polyol volume and higher<br>global Specialty Polyol volume, which was partially offset by lower North American Rigid Polyol and phthalic anhydride volumes. Foreign exchange<br>translation positively impacted net sales by 4%. Operating income was $19 million compared to $16.5 million in the same quarter last year. The<br>increase was primarily due to a 2% increase in global polyol volumes.<br>
Global Rigid Polyol volumes increased despite share loss in North America. Global Specialty Polyol volumes increased supported by the capacity<br>addition in Poland. Operating income in North America was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs during the quarter. European results<br>continued to improve due to higher Rigid and Specialty Polyol volumes and slightly higher margins. Phthalic anhydride results increased despite<br>lower volume and margins due to the nonrecurrence of costs associated with the scheduled maintenance shutdown in the fourth quarter of 2016.<br>The nonrecurring expense of $600,000 represents remediation costs in the fourth quarter of 2016.<br>
Specialty Product operating income decreased $2 million for the quarter, primarily due to the timing of orders in our flavor business and lower<br>volume and margins in our food business.<br>
We will now take a moment on the Slide #9 to recap the full year 2017 financial performance. Adjusted net income was, again, a record of $108.7<br>million, or $4.65 per diluted share, an 11% increase from $98.2 million, or $4.25 per diluted share, in 2016.<br>
Surfactant operating income was a record $120 million, up 20% from 2016. The increase was due to $10.2 million of nonrecurring expenses in the<br>prior year, settlement of a European product claim in 2017, growth in key global markets and savings from the Canadian plant shutdown.<br>
The Polymer segment delivered $82.8 million of operating income, a 14% decrease versus prior year. Polymer results for 2017 were the second<br>best on record. The decrease versus last year was primarily due to higher raw material costs despite higher European Rigid Polyol and global<br>Specialty Polyol volumes.<br>

<A name=628></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:00PM, SCL - Q4 2017 Stepan Co Earnings Call<br>
Specialty Product operating income was $10 million versus $10.7 million in the prior year.<br>
Slide #10 shows the total company earnings bridge for the full year 2017 compared to 2016. Like the quarterly bridge, the figures here are noted<br>on an after-tax basis.<br>
Turning to Slide #11. It is important to note that our balance sheet remains strong as we had no net debt at year-end. The company generated<br>$101 million of free cash flow during 2017, a 10% increase versus prior year. The company entered into a $350 million unsecured revolving line of<br>credit in January 2018, which will provide the company with flexibility to fund future growth opportunities.<br>
In 2017, we also increased our cash dividends for the 50th consecutive year, placing us in a very select group of companies.<br>
Beginning on Slide #12, Quinn will now address our path forward to further increase shareholder value.<br>
<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
Thank you, Matt. After record results in 2016 and 2017, we believe our Surfactant business will continue to benefit from our diversification efforts<br>into Functional Products, new technologies, expanded share into our broad customer base globally and the stabilization of commodity surfactant<br>volumes.<br>
However, headwinds in our North American Polymer business related to last year and lower margins will continue to challenge us in 2018. Results<br>will benefit from the lower U.S. corporate tax rate. Longer term we believe that our strategy to leverage our market leadership positions to diversify<br>our products and end markets, to collaborate with customers on new chemistries and to focus on operational excellence will drive shareholder<br>value.<br>
Turning to Slide #13. We believe that our market leadership position in several of our businesses is a strong foundation from which we can grow.<br>First, we are the largest producer of anionic and amphoteric surfactants for the merchant market in the Western Hemisphere. And we will advance<br>this position with the acquisition of the BASF plant and associated business in Ecatepec, Mexico. We believe our commodity anionic position should<br>stabilize and potentially grow in 2018.<br>
Next, we are the second-largest supplier of biodegradable fabric softener actives globally. Esterquats are the preferred technology in the developed<br>world and are being adopted in the developing world. With plants in all 4 regions of the world, Stepan is positioned to capture market growth.<br>
Finally, as a leading producer of rigid polyester polyols globally, we remain optimistic about the continued growth of the market due to increased<br>insulation standards, energy-conservation efforts and growth in construction.<br>
Although we experienced headwinds in our North American Polyol business during 2017, our European business remains strong.<br>
Now turning to Slide #14. Our diversification efforts continue to be a key component of our long-term strategy. First, over the last several years,<br>we have worked very closely with many large agricultural companies, and we believe Stepan chemistries will be included in many of their product<br>launches over the next 36 months.<br>
With regards to surfactant chemistries for oilfield, Stepan has a relatively low market share today. But we have significant opportunities to grow.<br>Stepan's portfolio of chemistries including biocides and foamers are well suited for use in the production of oil. And in fact, volumes on these<br>chemistries grew over 20% last year, albeit from a small base.<br>
Next, growth within the Tier 2 and Tier 3 customer base continues to be a key priority for our Surfactant business. And our sales to this segment<br>grew 8% in 2017.<br>

<hr>
<A name=629></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:00PM, SCL - Q4 2017 Stepan Co Earnings Call<br>
Our Surfactant customer portfolio includes many large consumer product customers, which cover a significant part of our overhead. But today,<br>Tier 2 and Tier 3 customers generate 35% to 40% of our Surfactant operating income. As such, our strategy to expand this segment to reach, to<br>delight and to acquire more new customers, local heroes, if you will, around the world is the top priority for our Surfactant team.<br>
Our knowledge and expertise in applications within the consumer product industry positions us well to help smaller companies create products<br>so that they can compete and win in their local markets. In order to reach these customers effectively, we are adding sales personnel and enhancing<br>our digital strategy.<br>
Finally, with respect to our CASE Polyol business, we experienced double-digit growth in 2017. We remain optimistic about the growth of the global<br>market and our business, in particular.<br>
Production from our new specialty polyol reactor in Poland, which began production in the fall of 2016, contributed to the strong volume growth<br>during 2017. In addition, a new specialty reactor in Columbus, Georgia began production in January of this year.<br>
Turning to Slide 15. Collaborative chemistry is a key foundation of our long-term strategy. First, as a leader in the Rigid Polyol market, we continue<br>to work on developing the next generation of value-added technologies for our customer base. We are excited about a few advances in our research<br>pipeline today. We continue to innovate and create more environmentally friendly green solvent chemistries, including our partnership with<br>Elevance, a metathesis-based technologies for the agricultural market. We recently launched a new solvent for the personal care end market that<br>allows customers to replace more expensive solubilizers while maintaining performance and reducing cost for liquid cleansing applications, such<br>as shampoo, body wash and hand soaps.<br>
Finally, within the oil market, stimulation segment is projected to grow at 13% per year over the next 5 years. Although U.S. oil producers have<br>reduced the cost of hydraulic fracking over the last decade, new chemistries can help reduce production costs further. Stepan has developed<br>patent-pending technology for use in fracturing including flowback modifiers and friction-reducer boosters that offer significant cost advantages.<br>Use of biocides is growing in the fracturing market due to regulations that restrict the use of freshwater, which should provide opportunities for<br>our biocidal quaternary products as is in blends.<br>
Turning to Slide 16. Our continued focus on operational excellence is a key aspect of our long-term strategy. We continue to actively pursue<br>opportunities to reduce excess capacity in our networks. Our 2017 results benefited significantly from previous actions in Canada, Brazil and<br>Singapore, and will from our plans to restructure our Fieldsboro plant. We will continue to examine our asset base for opportunities to further<br>optimize and improve our capacity utilization and more effectively serve our customers around the world.<br>
Next, we are delivering on our plans to increase our polymer production capacity by focusing on process improvements. We recently completed<br>debottlenecking project at our Wesseling plant, which should increase capacity by 20%. We believe we have further opportunities to increase our<br>polyol capacity at our Millsdale and Wesseling sites in 2018.<br>
DRIVE, our internal efficiency program, is now ingrained in our culture and is part of the way we do business. The DRIVE program will continue to<br>focus on supply chain optimization, procurement opportunities and SG&amp;A expense reduction.<br>
Finally, we will continue to focus on improving Stepan's working capital and free cash flow by standardizing and streamlining our processes and<br>by optimizing our inventory position.<br>
The market provides challenges and opportunities. We feel we are well positioned to capture opportunities for you, our shareholders.<br>
This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we would like to turn the call over for questions. Lena, please review the instructions for the<br>question portion of today's call.<br>

<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.<br>
<b>Michael Joseph Harrison</b> - Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Chemicals Analyst<br>
Just looking at the Surfactants business and the site closure that you announced. Can you walk through the timing and the expected savings related<br>to that closure in New Jersey? And how does capacity utilization look in North America after this action is complete?<br>
<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
So let me just talk about 2018 going forward. If we look at 2018, the cost savings that we will generate will primarily be offset by some of the<br>transition costs in 2018. We anticipate it to be beneficial in 2019 going forward. So minimal impact in '18. In terms of capacity utilization of our<br>North American network, we're getting to a position where we think we still have some excess capacity that allow us to grow in the marketplace.<br>But we have a comfortable amount of excess capacity today the way I would describe it.<br>
<b>Michael Joseph Harrison</b> - Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Chemicals Analyst<br>
All right. And looking at the Latin America business, you seem to be mentioning that the Brazil business contributed to the growth year-on-year.<br>What -- can you just kind of walk us through what the underlying growth has been in Latin America? I know that's been a good business at times,<br>but had some challenges more recently.<br>
<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
The growth that we're experiencing is primarily coming from 2 areas. One is continued growth in the agricultural end market, and the second is<br>the expansion of our Tier 2 and Tier 3 customer base, selling more of Stepan products to the business that we acquired, selling more Stepan products<br>to those customers, and also growing the number of customers where we're providing services.<br>
<b>Michael Joseph Harrison</b> - Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Chemicals Analyst<br>
All right. And then on...<br>
<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
And those 2 will perform well in 2018.<br>
<b>Michael Joseph Harrison</b> - Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Chemicals Analyst<br>
All right. And then on the Polymers business, just trying to dig in a little bit on the challenges that you're dealing with in North America. You<br>mentioned some share losses. But is the weakness there primarily volume related and therefore, related to fixed costs or throughput? Or are you<br>also seeing pricing competition that's weighing on your margin there?<br>

<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. We are experiencing both. So we have -- I would say, the decline in that business is equally split between volume loss and margin loss.<br>
<b>Michael Joseph Harrison</b> - Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Chemicals Analyst<br>
All right. Last question from me is just on the CFO search front. Obviously, you guys have a lot going on in terms of internal initiatives and growth<br>initiatives. Just wondering if you can kind of walk through the qualities or skill sets that you're going to be looking for in a new CFO?<br>
<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
So, yes -- so we are out in the marketplace looking. We have seen a number of very strong candidates and have a couple of them coming back in<br>for the second round of interviews. And we'll also probably look at a few more coming in the door for the first time. So we've seen some very<br>high-quality candidates that have great financial acumen. Some of them have investor experience. Others do not have as much investor relationship<br>experience. But we're very excited about the people that we've had an opportunity to talk to so far.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of David Stratton with Great Lakes Review.<br>
<b>David Michael Stratton</b> - Great Lakes Review - Research Analyst<br>
Your DRIVE benefits, you say that's ingrained in the culture now. What kind of benefits can we expect to realize or see realize in this year and going<br>forward? I know that previously it was around $10 million. Is that the expected run rate going forward? Or do you see that increasing, decreasing?<br>Just kind of help us think about that.<br>
<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. So every year we have an objective that's passed on throughout the company that we want to try to generate $25 million of benefits from our<br>DRIVE program. And we break that down into kind of which we're looking for at least $10 million of cash savings. Generally targeting kind of a<br>number little bit higher than that. So $10 million to $15 million of cash savings, $25 million of benefits. And we look at that trying to offset other<br>inflationary aspects of our business. So we feel good about the opportunities in the pipeline, and we believe that will help us maintain our current<br>cost structure.<br>
<b>David Michael Stratton</b> - Great Lakes Review - Research Analyst<br>
Great. And then you mentioned inflationary aspects. Can you kind of give a little commentary around where you see your input prices going as<br>we move into the 2018?<br>
<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. I think generally speaking with the improving economy, we would tend to think that most of our input prices would potentially increase. As<br>you are aware, and I think as most shareholders are aware, that we have a large percent of our contracts are tied to and include raw material<br>pass-through agreement. So we believe we can maintain our margins, potentially increase those in the Surfactant market in 2018. But we do believe<br>that there will be some challenges to do that in our Polymer business.<br>

<A name=632></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 3:00PM, SCL - Q4 2017 Stepan Co Earnings Call<br>
<b>David Michael Stratton</b> - Great Lakes Review - Research Analyst<br>
All right. And then one final one from me. Given the current rising interest rate environment, is there any impetus that you see to may be take on<br>a little debt just to lock in some fixed rates at these otherwise historically low rates? Or are you happy with the current capital structure and don't<br>see that need?<br>
<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
I believe, we borrowed some more money at a fixed rate going back to 2016. I think we...<br>
<b>Matthew John Eaken</b> - Stepan Company - Corporate Controller, Interim VP &amp; CFO<br>
That's correct.<br>
<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
So we got another, -- I can't remember exactly off the top of my head, but it was like $150 million at a relatively low fixed rate in 2016. As you know,<br>we expanded our revolver access to cash significantly in January of this year. So I don't see getting additional fixed debt at this point in time. But<br>we will look for opportunities to spend some of the money that we do have to increase our opportunities to grow.<br>
<b>David Michael Stratton</b> - Great Lakes Review - Research Analyst<br>
And what's your fixed floating mix right now as it stands with your revolver?<br>
<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
I'm not sure of that off the top of my head. So we can get back to you on that, David.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our next question comes from the line of Curt Siegmeyer with KeyBanc Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Curtis Alan Siegmeyer</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - Associate<br>
Just in terms of your outlook for the Polymer business in 2018, the impacts from the customer share loss didn't seem to be too obvious in the<br>numbers. So just as you kind of think about that going forward, is that something that you expect to be able to offset as the year progresses and<br>see growth in that business? Or is that something that you think is going to prevent the business from growing in 2018?<br>
<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
If we look at our Polymer business overall, we would anticipate very modest growth from a volume perspective in 2018.<br>

Got it. And then just in terms of your balance sheet strength, what would you say is the most likely use of your balance sheet capacity in 2018 and<br>beyond? Have you seen anything from an M&amp;A standpoint that might drive you to be a little more opportunistic there?<br>
<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
We want to be strategic. We don't necessarily want to be opportunistic. We want to make sure we're buying something that is consistent with our<br>long-term strategy. So we do want to be more acquisitive. We have a healthy balance sheet today. We've got cash to spend. We will look at funding<br>some significant internal organic opportunities as well as we will look at and consider acquisitions. As you know, the multiples in the marketplace<br>today for chemical acquisitions are relatively high. So we want to make sure that we're prudent in spending our shareholders' money carefully and<br>generating a return on that. In 2018, we will probably slightly increase our share buyback as well.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
There are no further questions at this time.<br>
<b>F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.</b> - Stepan Company - Chairman, President &amp; CEO<br>
All right. Well, thank you for joining us on the call today. We very much appreciate your interest and ownership in Stepan Company, and we look<br>forward to reporting to you on our first quarter 2018 call. Have a great day. Thank you.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect<br>your line.<br>

Good day, and welcome to the Bel Fuse, Inc. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At<br>this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dan Bernstein, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thank you, Tiffany. Joining me on the call today is Craig Brosious, our Vice President, Finance; and Lynn Hutkin, our Director of Financial Reporting.<br>
Before we begin the call, I'd like to ask Lynn to go over the safe harbor statement. Lynn?<br>
<b>Lynn Hutkin;Director of Financial Reporting</b><br>
Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everybody. Before we start, I'd like to read the following safe harbor statements. Except for historical information<br>contained on this call, the matters discussed on this call, such as statements regarding the amendments of the company's credit agreement, the<br>possibility of future acquisition, the repositioning of the Cinch Connect -- the historic connectors business, potential growth in the company's<br>commercial aerospace business and the potential impact of increased backlog, are forward-looking statements as described under the Private<br>Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projections.<br>
Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements are: the market concerns facing our customers; the<br>continuing viability of factors that rely on our products; the effects of business and economic conditions; difficulties associated with integrating<br>recently acquired companies; capacity and supply constraints or difficulties; product development, commercialization or technological difficulties;<br>the regulatory and trade environment; risks associated with foreign currencies; uncertainties associated with legal proceedings; the market's<br>acceptance of the company's new products and competitive responses to those new products; our ongoing evaluation of the consequences of<br>the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and the risk factors detailed from time to time in the company's SEC reports. In light of the risks and uncertainties,<br>there can be no assurance that any forward-looking statement will in fact prove to be correct. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any<br>forward-looking statements.<br>
We may also discuss non-GAAP results during this call, and reconciliations of our GAAP results to non-GAAP results have been included in our<br>release.<br>
I would now like to turn the call back to Dan for a general business update.<br>

<A name=636></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, BELFA - Q4 2017 Bel Fuse Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thank you, Lynn. Before going through the financials, I want to provide a brief update on how the businesses did from the operation standpoint<br>this quarter and what we see going forward.<br>
Sales during the fourth quarter were $119.9 million, up 1.2% from the fourth quarter of 2016, led by sales growth within our Connectivity Solutions<br>group of 8.1%. This was partially offset by the decline in sales at our Magnetic Solutions products of 1% and our Power Solutions and Protection<br>group of 3.3%.<br>
While sales increased during the fourth quarter over last year, our bottom line was unfavorably impacted by the following items: an $18 million<br>increase to our TARP provision related to the new tax reform; $1 million of incremental interest expense related to the acceleration of deferred<br>finance costs at our prior credit facility in connection with our refinancing; inventory-relating charges totaling $2 million, which had 170 basis<br>points impact on our gross margins for the quarter; and a $1.1 million increase in consulting fees related to our ERP implementation. As many of<br>these items are not expected to reoccur in 2018, we anticipate improved profitability going forward.<br>
Looking at the full year, we are pleased that 2 of the 3 product groups showed year-over-year sales increase from 2016. Our Magnetic Solutions<br>group closed the year with $5.8 million increase in sales over 2016 levels, largely due to our new product introduction with our ICM and Signal<br>Transformer product lines. We have been expanding the presence of our magnetic products through our distributor channels, which also continue<br>to grow year-over-year sales growth.<br>
Our Connectivity Solutions group had year-over-year sales growth of $1.5 million. Our Cinch business increased revenue by $7.1 million compared<br>to 2016, led by a strong demand for our active optical products using flight-grade, high-speed communications and encrypted (inaudible). The<br>top line growth in Cinch was also aided by more breadth and depth of our products going through distribution channels throughout the year.<br>These gains on Cinch side were largely offset by a $5.6 million decline in sales within our Stewart Connector business due to customer consolidation<br>in late 2016. There has been renewed focus on repositioning the Stewart's business, which has led to a $1.5 million or 43% increase in Stewart<br>backlog since 2016.<br>
Our Power Solutions and Protection group had yet another challenging year in 2017, with a $15.8 million decline in sales in 2016. Much of that<br>decrease related due to a $10.1 million drop in sales from our NPS product line, which previously divested. Sales of our upfront -- front-end board<br>-- I'm sorry. Sales of our front-end and board-mounted power products declined further in 2017 as large OEM customers continue to have lower<br>demand for their hardware products. These declines were offset by growth within our Power Europe Group in Italy, which generated $3.1 million<br>of higher sales related to marine and broadcast applications.<br>
Our circuit protection business has also experienced much success in 2017 with better utilization of our distribution channels yielding of $1.2<br>million or 11% increase in circuit protection sales compared to 2016. Although our 2017 sales were not very impressive from the overall Power<br>Solutions and Protection group, we did see a turning point in the fourth quarter as that was the first quarter since 2014 acquisition of Power<br>Solutions business, where we saw a year-over-year growth excluding the effects of the NPS divestiture.<br>
On a regional basis, in Europe, increased sales by $3.2 million or 4.2% increase in 2017 as compared to 2016. Sales in North America decreased by<br>$10.9 million or 4.3%. And sales in Asia were lower by $770,000 or a 5% decrease.<br>
On a consolidated basis, the company's backlog has increased to $146.5 million at December 31, 2017, which represents a $33 million increase or<br>a 29% increase from its level at December 2016. While we're unable to predict the effect that this increase will ultimately have on 2018 sales, it's a<br>good parameter we're well positioned for organic growth in the future periods over the next 4 quarters.<br>
At this point, I'd like to turn over the call to Craig.<br>

<A name=637></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, BELFA - Q4 2017 Bel Fuse Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Craig Brosious</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - VP of Finance, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
Thanks, Dan. As previously mentioned, sales during the fourth quarter were $119.9 million, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross profit<br>margin declined to 18.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with 20.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. This was largely due to $2 million of<br>inventory-related adjustments recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017.<br>
Our selling, general administrative expenses were $21.2 million or 17.7% of sales as compared with $16 million or 13.5% of sales in the fourth<br>quarter of 2016. The $5.2 million increase in SG&amp;A costs from last year's fourth quarter resulted from several factors. Foreign currency gains of $2.7<br>million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 did not recur during the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, there were incremental costs in the<br>fourth quarter of 2017 related to our ERP system implementation and higher professional fees related to tax consulting and the adoption of the<br>new revenue recognition standard as compared to the 2016 period.<br>
On a go-forward basis, we would expect SG&amp;A to run between $20 million and $21 million per quarter in the near term, barring any significant<br>fluctuations in foreign currency. As a result of these factors, we generated income from operations of $708,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 as<br>compared to $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.<br>
Income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 also included $1 million gain on the sale of a property in San Diego, which had a favorable<br>effect on last year's operating income. Interest expense was $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up $900,000 from the same period last year.<br>During the fourth quarter of 2017, we refinanced our credit agreement, which caused us to accelerate $1 million of amortization related to our<br>prior deferred financing costs. The impact of higher interest rates in 2017 was mitigated by our lower debt balance compared to 2016.<br>
The terms under the new credit facility improved our pricing grid over the new 5-year term, which should help to offset increases in the LIBOR rate.<br>Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a provision of 1,219% compared to a provision of 46.9% during last year's fourth quarter.<br>The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an $18 million impact related to the U.S. tax reform recorded during the fourth<br>quarter of 2017. This consisted of a $16 million transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings and incremental tax provision of $2 million<br>related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets due to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate.<br>
Based on a 2-year average of where our profits have historically been earned, we are estimating that the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate<br>offset by the effects of the GILTI tax on our low tax foreign income will result in an estimated global effective tax rate of between 17% and 19% for<br>2018.<br>
Loss per share for the Class A common shares was $1.66 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with earnings of $0.27 per share in<br>the fourth quarter of 2016. Loss per share for the Class B common shares was $1.74 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with<br>earnings of $0.29 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.<br>
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes certain unusual and other nonrecurring items, EPS for Class A shares was a loss of $0.09 per share in the<br>fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with earnings of $0.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS for Class B shares was<br>a loss of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with earnings of $0.33 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.<br>
And now I'd like to go through some balance sheet and cash flow items. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2017, was $69.4<br>million, a decrease of $4.1 million from December 31, 2016. During 2017, we made net payments of $18.8 million towards our outstanding debt<br>balance. We also used cash for capital expenditures of $6.4 million, dividend payments of $3.3 million and interest payments of $4.4 million.<br>
Accounts receivables was $78.8 million at December 31, 2017, as compared with $74.4 million at December 31, 2016. Days sales outstanding was<br>60 days at December 31, 2017. The increase in our accounts receivable balance was largely due to the higher sales volume in the fourth quarter of<br>2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, coupled with an increase in DSO, which was primarily a function of the timing of payments from<br>larger customers in our Asia segment.<br>

Inventories were $107.7 million at December 31, 2017, up $8.8 million from December 31, 2016. The increase was seen mostly in raw materials and<br>finished goods to accommodate the increase in bookings during 2017. Accounts payable was $47.9 million at December 31, 2017, up slightly from<br>December 31, 2016, due to the increase in raw material purchases.<br>
Bel's total outstanding debt as of December 31, 2017, was $125 million, excluding deferred financing cost. This represents a net decrease of $18.8<br>million from our 2016 year-end debt level. Book value per share, which is calculated as stockholders' equity divided by our combined A and B<br>classes of stock, outstanding was $13.13 per share at December 31, 2017, as compared to $13.17 per share at December 31, 2016.<br>
And now I'd like to turn the call back to Dan and open it for questions.<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Tiffany, at this point, we'd like to accept questions from our listeners.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Sean Hannan with Needham &amp; Company.<br>
<b>Sean Kilian Flanagan Hannan</b> - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Former Senior Analyst<br>
First thing, I'm not sure if I perhaps had missed in the prepared comments. What were the explicit revenues for each segment in the quarter?<br>
<b>Lynn Hutkin;Director of Financial Reporting</b><br>
I can give that to you, Sean. Are you looking for the fourth quarter or the full year?<br>
<b>Sean Kilian Flanagan Hannan</b> - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Former Senior Analyst<br>
Fourth quarter.<br>
<b>Lynn Hutkin;Director of Financial Reporting</b><br>
Fourth quarter, sure. So for Power Solutions and Protection, fourth quarter was $39.4 million; Magnetic Solutions is $38.5 million; and Connectivity<br>Solutions is $42 million.<br>
<b>Sean Kilian Flanagan Hannan</b> - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Former Senior Analyst<br>
Okay. All right. And then in terms of that inventory affect that you had, it sounds like for the most part, you're not expecting that to continue or<br>repeat in any manner in the next few quarters. Is that accurate? Or is it just a much smaller magnitude? How do we think about that?<br>

<A name=639></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, BELFA - Q4 2017 Bel Fuse Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Craig Brosious</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - VP of Finance, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
Well, we continue to evaluate our inventories for net realizable value. In the fourth quarter, we -- in other words, say, it's a higher-than-normal<br>adjustment that we had in the fourth quarter. We would have adjustments every quarter, but this was just kind of an outlier in terms of the<br>magnitude.<br>
<b>Sean Kilian Flanagan Hannan</b> - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Former Senior Analyst<br>
Okay. And what specifically drove that? I mean, is there any further detail we can get to understand exactly what happened there?<br>
<b>Craig Brosious</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - VP of Finance, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
Well, there were 2 things. There was -- one was related to the valuation of some inventory, where we had to make an adjustment to our purchase<br>price variance allocation to the inventory -- between cost of sales and our inventory balance. So that was an item that kind of arose as we were<br>reviewing the year-end balances. The other item was some inventory that we had a reserve on in prior periods. Again, expecting that we would<br>be able to do some rework on some products that whether the design -- there was an incremental design change, and we thought, we'd be able<br>to rework our existing inventory to satisfy the customer requirements. As time went on, the customers made some additional incremental design<br>changes and we made a decision at the end of the year where we felt that it was going to be too costly to rework that inventory so we basically<br>reserve for the remainder of that product.<br>
<b>Sean Kilian Flanagan Hannan</b> - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Former Senior Analyst<br>
Okay. All right. That's helpful. All right. And so next question just in terms of looking at the backlog here, the first that I'd have is, can you remind<br>us -- as I think about your backlog and try to think about where the revenue opportunity is as we all have our models, say, for '18, what do you<br>typically see as a split in revenues that come through a quarter? What comes out of backlog versus what's typical book and ship? Is there a way to<br>characterize that for each of your segments? Don't know if it's maybe 40% out of backlog, 60% book ship, any help on that would be great.<br>
<b>Craig Brosious</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - VP of Finance, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
In our magnetic segment, the turnaround is typically pretty fast. I wouldn't say all of it turns in the following quarter, but a large majority will turn<br>in the following quarter because our lead times tend to be a little bit shorter there. In the connectivity segment, some of our -- some of these orders<br>are either in our aerospace or military applications, and those tend to be longer-term in nature. So I don't really have a good handle on how much<br>of our Q4 backlog will actually turn in the first quarter. And the Power and Protection segment, it's kind of -- that's kind of what's in the middle. We<br>have a couple of large orders that are longer term in nature, but then we also have our, let's say, recurring orders, which would, again, kind of follow<br>in the same pattern as the magnetic. So it's difficult to answer.<br>
<b>Sean Kilian Flanagan Hannan</b> - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Former Senior Analyst<br>
Okay. Well, at least, we have some perspective there. Okay. So moving on to another topic here. As we look at the costs incurred around ERP, what<br>should we continue to factor there? And how is that overall effort going? When you folks sense that the elevated cost burden from that would be<br>concluded, et cetera?<br>

<b>Craig Brosious</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - VP of Finance, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
Yes. I think the last -- the fourth quarter was -- we were making a very large push towards getting the first phase of the project completed at the<br>end of the first quarter or late spring. We expect, probably, we'd have more expense. I don't know if it would be similar to what we had in the fourth<br>quarter, hopefully little lighter in the first quarter. It should start to trail off in the second and third quarters.<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
But we're -- I think we're looking at $500,000 a quarter, and the fourth quarter was about $1 million. And we project it probably for another 1.5<br>year.<br>
<b>Sean Kilian Flanagan Hannan</b> - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Former Senior Analyst<br>
Okay. So 500k a quarter next 1.5 year, next 6 quarters. Okay. That's helpful.<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Trust me, it hurts me more than it hurts you to take up on that. But then again, I have a BlackBerry. So what do I know, right?<br>
<b>Sean Kilian Flanagan Hannan</b> - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Former Senior Analyst<br>
Understood. All right. And so last question here, and it's really kind of been the big topic for a while. It's been referenced a little bit in your prepared<br>comments, the Power business. What comments can you share with us in terms of understanding or thinking about or any incremental degree of<br>enthusiasm for finally getting a much more material uptick in that revenue generation? We've been waiting for a while as a lot that you've been<br>designed into. You're getting good indicators through increases in backlog. Just trying to get a better understanding around where you folks sit?<br>How you're thinking about this business? Do you feel you're almost out of the woods and we're going to start picking up here?<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. We thought that we're out of the woods over the last year or so. So we think we're pretty well in the bushes still to be honest. You look at our<br>backlog. We do have a -- it went from, again, in 2015, if you just look at the Bel Power Solutions, which is a large part of the Power-One, it was $32.2<br>million in 2015. Last year, it was $29.5 million. This year it's $34.4 million. So again, I think we have made some really good strides and good roads.<br>What's really hurt us tremendously is the quality issues what we have at Facebook, where we think we addressed the issue properly and then<br>something happened and we get pushed back. And you're talking about sales. That should run about $1 million a month. So we're looking at today<br>possibly on that. We think it's fixed now, but we said that for other times. So I don't want to misuse it. But again, we can pick up $12 million from<br>Facebook get back to our normal run rate, which we think it's going to occur now in May. That definitely helps out everything we do. Again, we<br>do see a lot of good signs. We do see a lot of good things coming out of the data centers from doing our work at OCP. Again, but I -- until I see it,<br>until I see consistent sales growth, I just don't want to hype it up. We are streamlining the organization a little bit more. We're taking $1 million of<br>costs over the next 2 months at the group. So we know that, again, it's still a top priority of how do we turn around the top line growth.<br>
<b>Sean Kilian Flanagan Hannan</b> - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Former Senior Analyst<br>
So when you talk about the potential for a normalized run rate, maybe in May, and we'll see if that happens. Are you thinking about -- what kind<br>of number? I'm assuming it's not a $12 million on top of the $39 million, but just trying to understand a little context.<br>

<A name=641></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 4:00PM, BELFA - Q4 2017 Bel Fuse Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I think what we're hoping for, we're like -- currently, our sales are at $110 million. I think our goal is to get back to $125 million this year would be<br>our goal.<br>
<b>Lynn Hutkin;Director of Financial Reporting</b><br>
And that's just the Power Solutions, the acquired Power Solutions business Dan's referring to.<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes, business. And there I think we should be getting momentum.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
We'll go next to Hendi Susanto with Gabelli &amp; Company.<br>
<b>Hendi Susanto</b> - Morgan Group Holding Co. - Research Analyst<br>
Dan, could you talk about growth opportunities, new product and gross margin expectation in 2018?<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I'll let -- again, we're predicting upper mid-single-digit growth in the 7.5% range, I think, we feel somewhat confident about. We do have some big<br>opportunities in our modular group, where we do see -- it could be a possibly $10 million growth. We have (inaudible) for the product. We just<br>don't know because it's a retail product. We just don't know how it's going to be accepted in the field. So we see consistent growth with our Fuse<br>group. And then, of course, one of our large customers is Boeing, and we do a lot of work on the 737. So as they grow from 42 to 49 planes, we<br>think we see upswing there. Also with the military budget that we see a lot of strengthening with the Raytheons, the Honeywells and the Boeing<br>defense, those are opportunities that we can grow our business. So overall, I think -- and with the current backlog we have, I think we're pretty<br>confident that we should hit that 7.5% growth. From a gross margin standpoint, Craig, do you want to touch that?<br>
<b>Craig Brosious</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - VP of Finance, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
Yes. Hendi, we should be able to leverage that growth into some improved gross margins. Again, it kind of varies with our whatever line of business<br>we're talking about. In the Mil-Aero segment, that has a little bit more leverage on gross margin than, let's say, the power protection business. But<br>-- so I think, we would expect a 1 point, 1.5 point of margin, if we can accomplish within saying 7.5% sales growth.<br>
<b>Hendi Susanto</b> - Morgan Group Holding Co. - Research Analyst<br>
And then, Dan, when you mentioned some retail products, are they consumer electronics?<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
They're -- again, we were working with a company that used to -- the group came out of nest, working at a new lighting.<br>

<b>Craig Brosious</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - VP of Finance, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
Yes. The smart lighting application, Hendi. So it's consumer focus, but not mobile phones or anything like that.<br>
<b>Hendi Susanto</b> - Morgan Group Holding Co. - Research Analyst<br>
And then, Dan, I think I would like to comment that, I think, it just sounds more optimistic than in the past in terms of growth opportunities. And<br>I think that kudos to you.<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I think a lot of that is based on our backlog. And again, looking at our backlog, again, going from -- as I said, in 2015, our backlog was $126 million.<br>2016 was $113 million. And today, our backlog is $146 million. So I think that gives me finally some good hope and hopefully some light through<br>the forest now. And I think the other thing that I think is pretty exciting for us, as we mentioned in our press release, the ability to look at acquisitions,<br>be a lot more aggressive with the acquisitions going forward with the new credit facility we have in place. So we think that's going to add a lot of<br>growth opportunities to us also.<br>
<b>Hendi Susanto</b> - Morgan Group Holding Co. - Research Analyst<br>
And then Craig, for our model, how much cash payment do you need to make to account for the onetime U.S. tax reform adjustment?<br>
<b>Craig Brosious</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - VP of Finance, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
In the first year, I believe, it's like $1.3 million.<br>
<b>Hendi Susanto</b> - Morgan Group Holding Co. - Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And I believe that it's like over 8 years?<br>
<b>Craig Brosious</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - VP of Finance, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
It's over 8 years. That's correct.<br>
<b>Hendi Susanto</b> - Morgan Group Holding Co. - Research Analyst<br>
Yes. So $1.3 million represents, I think, 8%?<br>
<b>Lynn Hutkin;Director of Financial Reporting</b><br>
8%.<br>
<b>Craig Brosious</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - VP of Finance, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
Right, right.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
We'll go next to [Lenny Dunn] with Mutual Trust Company of America.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
I'm glad to see that you have apparently turned things around and digested that Power-One, which turned out to be just a can of worms, but pails<br>of worms. But it does appear that you have things under control and you can now start paying down debt. I mean, this is always a debt-free company<br>with a lot of cash. We don't need to be that. But we're recurring a lot of debt. And I get a little nervous when I hear acquisitions because you don't<br>know for sure what you're buying, and Power-One will be a strong example of that. And if you have everything turned around and we're growing<br>internally or not go through some time of internal growth, pay down debt a little before we start moving on more acquisitions.<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I think, [Lenny], the problem we have -- and we have a pretty active board. And one of our key board members is a person called Avi Eden from<br>Vishay. And he was responsible being with Vishay from that growth cycle of a $60 million company up to a $2.4 billion. The problem that we face<br>in our industry is that we've always -- our customers really are not concerned with price increases and labor whatever or what happens with copper<br>now or minimum material cost. They demand 2% or 3% price reductions twice a year. And the only way you really can get those costs to meet<br>those demands even with organic growth of 7.5%, you'll be treading water. And the only way you really can be successful is really growing the top<br>line, knocking out, looking at acquisitions, taking out overhead and really running a lot more efficiently. I wish I could do it with organic growth.<br>But to be honest, to see the demands that we have out there from our customers, at 7.5%, it helps, but it really doesn't get us where you have to<br>be. If we were having 15% to 18% growth, then I could say, hey, acquisitions wouldn't be as high as a priority as it is today. But at the current rate,<br>I do think of that best is tread water. Hopefully that makes sense.<br>
<b>Unidentified Analyst</b><br>
Well, it makes sense, but the danger of buying something unknown after the experience we had with Power-One makes me a little nervous. That's<br>all.<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
That makes me nervous. I think we've learned a lot of lessons. Again, we did spend a lot of money. It really was -- came down to almost, if you look<br>at the sales today, it was only 1x sales. So we really didn't pay a high premium for it. But from a share standpoint, the relationships we have with<br>our customers now, what we can offer our customers and a lot of intangibles is really strengthening overall relationship with our customers. And<br>from a power standpoint, one of the things that we never realized was when you are dealing -- generally, a lot of our products are commoditized.<br>So a lot of times when we talk to our customers, it's price, price, price. But one thing about power, it's really a engineering design product, and it's<br>not as price-sensitive as our other product groups are, and that's a great opportunity for us. We hope we can shine a lot better than we have in the<br>past. So if I -- by the way if I had to do the acquisition again, I would do it again, but probably beat up the price a lot better than I did.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) And we have no further questions at this time. I do apologize. We do have a question from Hendi Susanto with Gabelli &amp;<br>Company.<br>

<b>Hendi Susanto</b> - Morgan Group Holding Co. - Research Analyst<br>
Dan, if may add one more questions, I think there are some growth areas, such as like smart homes. You made some smart lighting and then<br>increasing electronic contents for industrial and automotive. How should we view Bel Fuse's position in those growth areas?<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
I think it's too early to tell. I mean, again, the Internet of Things, harsh environment, that's where we see a lot of growth. A lot of the things that are<br>outside that connect things together, we do think a lot more opportunities for the Stewart Connector product line. Automobiles, we really just<br>started to scratch the surface from a circuit protection standpoint. We think there is a good growth. I think, we could do a lot better. That's one of<br>our key areas that we look at focusing going forward is in automobile and what goes on inside the car from electronic standpoint. However, I think<br>at this point, the journey is still half. For example, Tesla was supposed doing the model 3. I think they are supposed to be building 5,000 cars a<br>month. And they still add 500 a month, where I think 250 going back for quality. But those are the markets we're trying to address a lot better.<br>
<b>Hendi Susanto</b> - Morgan Group Holding Co. - Research Analyst<br>
So you can do that organically, inorganically? Do you have interest in acquiring companies that have components in those areas?<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Definitely, yes. I think what we're looking at now -- some of the companies we are looking at now are stronger in that -- on those markets than we<br>are. And they can give us better entree into those markets. So that's an area, but it's similar to the products we have today.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
And we do have a follow-up question from Sean Hannan with Needham &amp; Company.<br>
<b>Daniel Bernstein</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. Sean?<br>
<b>Sean Kilian Flanagan Hannan</b> - Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Former Senior Analyst<br>
Sorry, I was on mute there. Just really quick. How should we think about an effective tax rate, as we look out to '18 here?<br>
<b>Craig Brosious</b> - Bel Fuse Inc. - VP of Finance, Treasurer &amp; Secretary<br>
Yes. I mean, we look at that. And again, it's very highly dependent on where our profits are earned, but we did an analysis over the last -- looking<br>at the last couple of years and assuming 2018 kind of mirrors those last couple of years. We think it's going to be in the 17% to 19% range for 2018.<br>
<b>Lynn Hutkin;Director of Financial Reporting</b><br>
And Sean that does include an estimate for the what's termed as the GILTI tax that the global tax on low tax foreign earnings. (inaudible) effective<br>tax rate.<br>

<A name=648></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, INT - Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Michael J. Kasbar</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon, everyone. We closed out the year with a lot of changes and events behind us and a clearer focus for the<br>future. I'll comment more on that after Ira goes through our financial review of results, which includes of course, the impact of tax reform and other<br>items.<br>
Ira?<br>
<b>Ira M. Birns</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Thanks, Mike. And good evening, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted net income of $17 million in the fourth quarter. That's an increase of<br>$2.7 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. And for the full year, adjusted net income was $127 million, a decrease of $20 million<br>compared to 2016.<br>
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.25 in the fourth quarter, up from $0.21 in the fourth quarter of last year. And full year adjusted diluted<br>earnings per share was $1.86 this year compared to $2.11 in 2016.<br>
For the past several years, we have provided 2 or often 3 income and EPS measures: GAAP; adjusted GAAP, which simply adds back nonrecurring<br>charges and; non-GAAP, which additionally, adds back intangible amortization and stock-based compensation.<br>
We've received feedback from investors that this has been cumbersome and confusing. So effective this quarter, we have simplified such reporting.<br>We are now only reporting GAAP and adjusted GAAP. Intangible amortization and stock-based compensation information will always be available<br>on our public filings for those who find such information useful for modeling purposes.<br>
At the same time, we will now regularly report adjusted EBITDA, which we find to be a very meaningful measure of our operating results and growth<br>as well as a common valuation metric. For this reason, we are more closely focused on this metric and looking to drive significant year-over-year<br>improvements. Now onto the detailed review of the financial statements.<br>
Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $8.9 billion, up 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was principally due to<br>the significant increase in oil prices compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.<br>
For the full year, revenue was $33.7 billion, an increase of $6.7 billion or 25% compared to 2016.<br>
Our aviation segment volume was 2 billion gallons in the fourth quarter, up approximately 130 million gallons or 7% year-over-year. Volume growth<br>in our aviation segment was derived, principally from gains in our core resale operations in North America and EMEA as well as sales coming from<br>our acquired international physical fueling operations compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. And for the full year, aviation volume was 7.9 billion<br>gallons, up 800 million gallons or 11% year-over-year.<br>
Volume in our marine segment for the fourth quarter was 6.1 million metric tons, down approximately 1.5 million metric tons or 20% year-over-year.<br>The largest drivers of the volume reduction relate to our operations in the Asia-Pac region and our decision to exit certain markets, we have seen<br>continued market pressure and weakness as well as our conscious efforts to reduce activity in regions where we have not been achieving satisfactory<br>returns on capital.<br>
While some of these efforts impacted profitability in the fourth quarter, they directly contributed to our strong cash flow performance. For the full<br>year, volume in our marine segment was 26.5 million metric tons, down 4.8 million metric tons or 15% year-over-year. This decline principally<br>related to the previously mentioned decisions to exit markets or scale-down certain activities.<br>
Our land segment volumes was 1.5 billion gallons during the fourth quarter, effectively flat with the fourth quarter of the prior year. And for the<br>full year, volume in the land segment was 5.9 billion gallons, that's an increase of 600 million gallons or 11% year-over-year.<br>

<hr>
<A name=649></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, INT - Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call<br>
Total consolidated volume in the fourth quarter was 5.1 billion gallons, a decrease of approximately 280 million gallons or 5% year-over-year. And<br>for the full year, consolidated volume was a record 20.9 billion gallons.<br>
Before I continue with the financial review, I would like to review all the nonrecurring charges highlighted in our earnings release for the fourth<br>quarter.<br>
First, we took an impairment charge of $91.9 million, nearly 85% of which related to our marine segment with the remainder principally related to<br>writing down 2 underperforming minority investments. This change is a result of our annual goodwill and asset impairment tests required under<br>GAAP.<br>
Due to continued weakness in maritime markets over the past year, including reduced profitability from the sale of price risk management products<br>to our customers as well as our decision to exit our marine business in certain international markets, this is obviously a noncash charge and has no<br>impact on our financial flexibility.<br>
We also recorded a restructuring charge of $59.6 million in the fourth quarter, principally related to our ongoing efforts to rationalize our portfolio,<br>including completely exiting the railcar business and exiting a low return capital-intensive distributor program within the land segment. These<br>moves will result in a positive benefit of approximately $8 million annually going forward.<br>
The restructuring charge also includes approximately $6 million of severance charges related to our continued cost-saving initiatives during the<br>fourth quarter. We expect to identify additional opportunities to restructure operations, exit noncore or underperforming assets or lines of businesses<br>in an effort to more effectively deploy our resources, both capital and people to drive improved profitability.<br>
Finally, we booked an income tax charge of approximately $157 million, which includes a $144 million onetime transition toll charge on historical<br>accumulated foreign earnings payable over 8 years as a result of U.S. tax reform. We intend to use our U.S. net operating losses and as a result,<br>expect to only pay approximately $100 million over the 8 year period with approximately $8 million due in the second quarter of this year.<br>
To assist all of you in reconciling results published in our earnings release and 10-K, we have provided a reconciliation of these amounts reflecting<br>how all of these charges have impacted our segment operating results on our website and on the last slide of today's webcast presentation.<br>
So now the following numbers exclude the full impact of all the items that I just described. Starting with gross profit. Consolidated gross profit for<br>the fourth quarter was $230 million, an increase of $5 million or 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.<br>
For the full year, consolidated gross profit was a record $932 million, an increase of $30 million or 3% compared to 2016.<br>
Our aviation segment contributed $106 million of gross profit in the fourth quarter, that's an increase of $4 million or 4% year-over-year. However,<br>multiple factors contributed to a significant negative impact to gross profit in the fourth quarter, which were not anticipated when we provided<br>guidance in late October.<br>
As we have discussed in the past, our aviation customers rely on us to provide a stable and secure supply of jet fuel at airport locations, which<br>requires our aviation business to always be long jet fueled to support our end-user commitments. We have also stated -- we also have a stated<br>policy of fully hedging this related inventory position.<br>
Even with a highly correlated hedge program, we still have exposure from the shape of the market curve.<br>
During the fourth quarter, the jet fuel market was subject to increasing backwardation, driven principally by the lingering impacts of the September<br>hurricanes and the impact of severe weather conditions during the latter part of the fourth quarter.<br>
Because we are long inventory for the reason I described earlier, we have resulting exposure from the shape of the price curve. Hedging in a<br>backwardated market during the quarter, actually contributed to a negative gross profit impact of approximately $10 million.<br>

Furthermore, the sharp jet fuel price increase at the end of the quarter resulted in a timing difference between the resulting mark-to-market impact<br>of our jet fuel hedges at year-end and the additional gross profit generated from selling fuel with a lower cost basis at higher prices in January.<br>
In dollars, this amounted to approximately $7 million. And as anticipated, we recovered this full amount during the early part of this quarter. These<br>negative impacts in the fourth quarter were partially offset by growth in our military-related business, operated through our NCS platform.<br>
For the full year, gross profit on our aviation segment was $441 million, an increase of $40 million or 10% compared to 2016.<br>
As we enter the annual aviation fuel tender season, our team remains focused on organically growing the core resale business with both new and<br>existing customers.<br>
We experienced strong results in NCS in 2017, driven in great part by the strength of our relationship and our ability to deliver service excellence<br>in extremely competitive or complex and hostile environment. As a result of such efforts, we have recently been awarded a 2-year contract extension.<br>Such contract does incorporate lower margins. So despite continued strong levels of volume quarter-to-date, profits related to this activity are<br>expected to decline over the course of this year.<br>
As we look to the first quarter, with the shape of the price curve smoothing out, we expect stronger inventory related results, including the $7<br>million recovery described earlier offset in part by lower sequential profitability from our NCS government business.<br>
In aggregate, this should lead to improved aviation results in the first quarter. The marine segment generated fourth quarter gross profit of $29<br>million, down $6 million or 16% year-over-year. The gross profit decline was principally driven by the reasons described earlier as well as a further<br>decline in profits from the sale of price risk management products.<br>
We remain focused on driving further cost efficiencies in the marine business, which I will elaborate on further in a few moments.<br>
For the full year, marine gross profit was $126 million, a decrease of $25 million or 16% year-over-year. As we look to the first quarter for marine,<br>we expect gross profit to be relatively flat, but sequential marine results should improve driven principally by the benefit of additional cost-reduction<br>activities.<br>
Our land segment delivered gross profit of $96 million in the fourth quarter, that's an increase of $7 million or 8% year-over-year. The increases in<br>gross profit were principally related to increases in natural gas sales through our existing Kinect business and the continued strong performance<br>of our Multi Service payment solutions business. However, fourth quarter results were weaker than anticipated, driven by continued weakness in<br>our North American supply and trading platform, including lingering hurricane impacts as well as modest weakness in the U.K. despite what was<br>a reasonably cold winter season.<br>
Gross profit associated with our Multi Service payment solutions business was $16 million in the fourth quarter, that's an increase of 25% compared<br>to the fourth quarter of last year, again, demonstrating the expansion of our global FinTech payments platform and the continued ability of our<br>Multi Service team to identify new customer engagements which tap into the unique value proposition which Multi Service offers.<br>
For the full year, gross profit from the overall land segment was $366 million. That's an increase of $15 million or 4% (sic) [5%] compared to 2016.<br>
First quarter results for land are expected to increase sequentially, driven principally by seasonal strength in our U.K. business as well as the benefit<br>of additional cost-reduction activities.<br>
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter, excluding our provision for bad debt and onetime items were $188 million. That's up $6 million<br>year-over-year. The increase is principally related to expenses of recently acquired companies and investments specific to Multi Service at NCS,<br>supporting growth initiatives in Multi Service and contractual requirements at NCS. Excluding these factors, expenses were actually down slightly<br>year-over-year.<br>

<A name=651></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, INT - Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call<br>
As we continue to step up our cost efficiency initiatives, we expect operating expenses, excluding bad debt and onetime items to be in the range<br>of $178 million to $182 million in the first quarter, which would represent a sequential decline of approximately 4%, reflecting the impact of our<br>most recent cost-reduction initiatives.<br>
We are focused on driving expense ratios in both our land and marine businesses, down by a minimum of 3% to 4% in 2018.<br>
For marine, reflecting our continued effort to rationalize spending to adjust to the realities of this business today. And for land, we are focused on<br>making greater strides in integration, reducing inefficiencies and driving stronger profitability.<br>
And under the leadership of our Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Smith, we are undergoing an organizational redesign of our back office and IT operations<br>to create a leaner cross-functional team, which will leverage our enhanced technology platform. We have already made significant progress here<br>quarter-to-date, which will contribute to our cost-reduction program during 2018.<br>
Consolidated income from operations for the fourth quarter was $39 million, up $5 million or 16% year-over-year. For the full year, consolidated<br>income from operations was $215 million, up $6 million or 3% compared to 2016. And adjusted EBITDA was $60.5 million in the fourth quarter, up<br>from $57.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.<br>
For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was just under $296 million, up from $292 million in 2016. Again, we believe this is a meaningful metric and we<br>are focused on driving improvement in adjusted EBITDA in 2018 and beyond.<br>
Nonoperating expenses, which is principally comprised of interest expense, was $19 million in the fourth quarter. This represents an increase of<br>$5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, principally relating to the higher borrowings associated with increased working capital<br>requirements, which were driven by higher fuel prices during the fourth quarter as well as higher average interest rates compared to the fourth<br>quarter of 2016.<br>
At the end of December, the recently announced tax reform bill provided us the opportunity to repatriate a significant amount of cash held by our<br>foreign subsidiaries. We immediately took advantage of this opportunity and we repaid nearly $250 million of debt prior to year-end with further<br>debt reductions during January. This reduction offset in part by expected increases in borrowing rates through the year 2018 should enable us to<br>reduce annual interest expense by somewhere around $10 million in 2018 on a year-over-year basis.<br>
With that being said, I would assume interest expense will be in the range of $13 million to $16 million in the first quarter. The company's effective<br>tax rate in the fourth quarter was 18.3% compared to 28.8% in the fourth quarter of last year.<br>
As we look to 2018, our effective tax rate will be negatively impacted by tax reform. More specifically, the new global intangible low tax income or<br>GILTI provision of a tax reform bill is expected to increase our effective tax rate. This is based on our expectation that are consistent with prior years,<br>the majority of our income will be generated by foreign entities in foreign jurisdictions which also have a low level of foreign depreciable assets.<br>Therefore, we believe our 2018 effective tax rate will likely increase to the mid-20s, significantly higher than our historical effective tax rate.<br>
Now considering tax reform is less than 2 months old and many elements of the new tax code are still being interpreted, we continue to analyze<br>all relevant changes and their impact on our business with the goal of arriving at the most efficient tax structure possible. Potentially, with an<br>effective tax rate lower than the estimates I just provided.<br>
While our tax rate may be higher than our historical rates, in 2018, there is great value in the freedom to move capital across our business with<br>significantly reduced restrictions. And a lower U.S. corporate tax rate provides us with the potential for greater returns related to our pipeline of<br>strategic investment opportunities, which most significantly reside in the United States.<br>
On our balance sheet, accounts receivable was $2.7 billion at the end of the year, which is an increase of approximately $360 million year-over-year.<br>This is principally due to higher fuel prices. Despite the increase in fuel prices, our working capital initiatives, including the marine initiative referred<br>to earlier, have been paying off and contributed to operating cash flow generation of $160 million in the fourth quarter.<br>

We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and generating consistently healthy cash flows as we have done for the past several<br>years. While 2017 was a challenging year for us, we started taking important steps towards driving meaningful change throughout the organization.<br>We are building a more efficient operating model, which should facilitate greater opportunities, both organic and strategic investments. With the<br>objective of driving solid cash flows and improved operating results in 2018 and beyond.<br>
I will now turn the call back to over to Mike who has some additional remarks.<br>
<b>Michael J. Kasbar</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Thank you, Ira. If we look back at the origins of our business our roots were in creating value as a reseller in fragmented markets through price,<br>location, credit and information arbitrage. It seemed like one big endless summer where we were looking for the next big waves of value to the<br>marketplace at the time, and of course, gross profit.<br>
Cost really wasn't a critical part of the equation within that simple business model. Today, almost everything has changed in energy, finance,<br>information and technology. Now we have shale oil and shale gas. We rode that constrained crude oil while it lasted in North Dakota, but that came<br>crashing down. We have low cost of money, low price, ample supply of almost everything and a highly transparent and consolidated marketplace.<br>
Our value proposition is now increasingly as a specialized distribution and service network, providing comprehensive and easily accessible solutions.<br>Low cost and scalability are key as is the right mix of activities to serve a more demanding customer and competitive marketplace.<br>
As such, the 3 pillars around which everything we do revolves are: one, a continuous cost management culture; two, a disciplined sharpening of<br>the portfolio; and three, driving aggressive organic growth complemented with selective acquisitions.<br>
Of course, an intense focus on the market, talent and culture is foundational for any successful organization. Our approach to cost management<br>is comprised of utilizing a digital and agile business team methodology to leapfrog manual processes and accelerate the integration of people and<br>approved processes in problem-solving. The nature of work is changing, and so are we.<br>
We have started to restructure parts of our business, utilizing this approach. Telemetry, telematics, logistics, optimization, increased spans and<br>reduced layers, collocation, shared service centers, empowered end-to-end agile teams, consolidated procurement, elimination of data centers<br>and aggressively moving to cloud-based solutions will over time materially change our cost structure. We are at the early stages of this process,<br>but expect material impact over the next 24 months.<br>
In 2017, we exited our rail C-Store of small-scale LNG joint venture and a low return distributor program and are aggressively reviewing all discrete<br>activities to test for return, runway and relevance to our markets and vision.<br>
Our diversified aviation services network and distribution platform continues to perform well and is a model for land and marine. Our rightsized<br>marine business should yield better returns and is poised in the longer term to capitalize on the continuing need in the market for a comprehensive<br>service and distribution partner. We are well positioned to provide any solution for 2020 when low sulphur regulations commence.<br>
Our land business should perform better in 2018 as we transition the business mix on the East Coast from a wholesale to retail recurring revenue<br>model and drive efficiencies in the U.K. and U.S. platforms.<br>
The North American market, which represents around 21% of global liquid-energy demand, is attractive to grow and leverages our maturing<br>organization and the appeal of tax reform. We fully expect our Kinect Energy Group will deliver a material EBITDA run rate by 12/19. This is a sizable<br>and growing market and we are committed to grow organically and through strategic investments.<br>
Multi Service growth is accelerating. We remain bullish about its prospects for using its specialized expertise to solve complicated business problems<br>with payments as well as driving synergies across our global platform.<br>

To drive growth across our enormous population of existing and potential customers, with a broad product and service offering across an enviable<br>geography, we are embarking on an aggressive zero-touch enterprise deployment of Salesforce.com, which will be fully installed in 2018. We<br>expect this initiative to be transformational in itself.<br>
The market has transformed significantly and technology will continue to change almost everything we do. We are leveraging the world's best<br>technology partners to accelerate our transformation and create greater value in the markets we serve.<br>
It's certainly a time of tremendous change, when our organization has a burning desire to leverage our broad energy, logistics and FinTech capability<br>using exciting new tools and methodologies to continuously manage cost, sharpen our portfolio and drive growth with an exceptionally valuable<br>set of product services and integrated solutions.<br>
I'll now turn over the call to our operator to begin the question-and-answer session.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch.<br>
<b>Kenneth Scott Hoexter</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD and Co-Head of the Industrials<br>
Looks like, I guess, you've made about 17 or up to 20 acquisitions over the past decade. Today, we're hearing a lot about trimming, I guess, cost<br>cuts, trimming charges. Is there still more integration that you need to occur here? Maybe you can take a step back, Michael, it sounded like you<br>want to take a step back and talk about kind of what you started as, are there too many disparate businesses here? Or do you still feel like you've<br>headed in the right direction with these acquisitions now that you are stepping back with the cost-cutting program?<br>
<b>Michael J. Kasbar</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Listen, I think that -- I don't really have any regrets. All the businesses we bought were good businesses with good people. I think if I had to turn<br>the clock back, I'd do a couple of different things because I think we were taking intelligent diversification steps. I think I would have dropped some<br>people and done it a little bit different. I think we are a lot smarter now in terms of how to acquire, how to integrate cultures, brands, technology.<br>We sort of left the folks alone, we left the technology alone and now we've got I think a much stronger view on how to move a lot more quickly.<br>Technology is the name of the game. And within our U.S. land platform, we've got a disparate number of systems. We are moving them to the<br>cloud, which will accelerate our ability to deal with that. Jeff Smith, obviously, is going to be instrumental in doing that. And with Kinect, massive<br>amount of data. I mean Kinect alone has 30 terabytes themselves, so incredibly data intensive business. So the technology side of it is crucial. I<br>don't want to say it's the name of the game with growing businesses, but it's a big, big part of it and we're not really where we need to go. So that's<br>something that we have to move very quickly on. Mike Crosby on the land side and his team I think are doing an excellent job in the U.S. We're<br>optimistic and bullish in terms of our ability to bring that together and brand that properly. So I feel good about what we're doing. We definitely<br>-- cost is a whole different ballgame today. It's not an event. It's something that is continuous. So we're serious about it. We have an outside view.<br>We have outside people helping us and teaching us some new tricks so it's important. It's very difficult and when you look at marine and aviation,<br>obviously, marine has its own issues but we're working through them. If you look at aviation, they've got a platform. We spent a lot of time years<br>ago and created an end-to-end solution. So if you've got the people, the process and the technology and that is what allows them to scale. We<br>don't exactly have that in land. Land is a conglomeration of a number of different businesses and systems and technologies and we're bringing<br>those together and as that comes together, and it is coming together, we're going to see a better result, a more predictable result, recurring revenue.<br>We went through debt commodity cycle. We started out exploiting the inefficiencies in the marketplace. That was our first cycle. We rode the<br>commodity side. Q4 of '14, Q1 of '15 it came crashing down. We should have pivoted faster, but okay, it is what it is. And now we're smarter and<br>it's hedged down to basically go after that.<br>

<b>Kenneth Scott Hoexter</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD and Co-Head of the Industrials<br>
Let me just follow up. Ira, you talked about bidding back for NCS. Maybe you can talk a little bit more about that? Obviously, I presume you view<br>it as still profitable, but why chase that business at that lower margins? Does that highlight how competitive the market has become? Or I guess<br>as Michael keeps talking about on technology that others can provide this kind of service? And should we expect continual degradation of margins<br>going forward on new business given that contract renewal?<br>
<b>Michael J. Kasbar</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
So -- listen, we've been in the government business and government contracting business since the late '80s. And it's really helped our company<br>tremendously. I've compared it to Formula One racing for passenger cars where you really have to deal with the contracting and logistics. It's serious<br>requirements and it's really helped our company in its commercial activities. So that's a 2-year contract. And we'll have, obviously, the uncertainties<br>of what the volume may be, but that is a contract. So that margin shouldn't change. But we'll continue to develop our capability. We already are<br>expanding that in different geographies and taking it wherever -- different governments have an interest in our contracting and logistics capabilities.<br>So we don't -- that margin is locked in for at least 2 years within the possibility of extensions.<br>
<b>Ira M. Birns</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
And additional opportunities that you mentioned as well.<br>
<b>Michael J. Kasbar</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Yes, that's right. And we are in sort of a pole position for when there are other requirements that come up in that area or other areas. So as Ira<br>commented in his script, we've got an excellent relationship with them and we've got a fantastic reputation for performance. So it's an important<br>part of our area -- of our business and we leverage that within our commercial area, I think I mentioned with the ExxonMobil acquisition, we'd use<br>the physical logistics competencies of our military personnel to handle those interplain deliveries in those 7 countries around the world. So we set<br>up a center of excellence on logistics and that worked out for us extremely well.<br>
<b>Kenneth Scott Hoexter</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD and Co-Head of the Industrials<br>
Just a quick one, Ira. Did you say that the hedges now are back in proper format as far as going from backwardation? Or is that continuing into the<br>2018?<br>
<b>Ira M. Birns</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
That backwardated curve smoothed out. I would say by the middle of January, it was back to way more normal levels. It was really one of the most<br>severely backwardated markets that we've seen in many, many years in the fourth quarter. But thus far, where we sit today, it's been very calm and<br>the issues I described do not seem to be repeating themselves during this quarter.<br>

<A name=655></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 10:00PM, INT - Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call<br>
<b>Kevin Wallace Sterling</b> - Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division - Former MD &amp; Senior Analyst<br>
So the marine volumes we saw in Q4 '17, should we expect something similar in the first quarter of '18? Or do you have more markets to exit?<br>
<b>Michael J. Kasbar</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
I don't know if we have more markets to exit. We're being mindful of returns. So there has been some changes that is not a surprise to folks that<br>have been following the marine business. We're looking as I said to model our physical business. I think aviation has it right in terms of the third-party,<br>the inventory, the distribution, the technology side of it. So it's certainly not in a robust place. So if we can't get the returns then we're going to be<br>focused on that financial discipline. We certainly want to support our clients and we're still committed to the space. So I don't see -- I don't think<br>we see growth in volume -- aggressive growth in volume. So I'd say it's more likely to be flat.<br>
<b>Kevin Wallace Sterling</b> - Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division - Former MD &amp; Senior Analyst<br>
Okay. That helps. And as you've exited those marine markets, are you deploying those resources elsewhere?<br>
<b>Michael J. Kasbar</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
In some cases, yes. In some cases, we're just reducing costs.<br>
<b>Kevin Wallace Sterling</b> - Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division - Former MD &amp; Senior Analyst<br>
Okay. Ira, looks like you guys paid down a good chunk of debt in the quarter. Do you expect to continue to delever in 2018? Is that the plan?<br>
<b>Ira M. Birns</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Assuming that -- we've already pretty much paid down all the debt we could with the cash that became available to us because of the tax reform.<br>We've got a pretty good track record. We have an excellent track record of consistently generating operating free cash flow year in, year out. You<br>may note that interestingly enough, we generated the exact same amount of operating cash flow in '17 as we did in '16 by coincidence. So to the<br>extent we continue to do that, we can now more likely use that cash to delever further, assuming prices stay in the same ballpark. As of course, if<br>prices move up, that may require some more capital or if we decide to go after some of the strategic opportunities that are in the pipeline that<br>remains very robust for us. Obviously, we use some cash there too. So depends on a few factors. But the cool thing now, Kevin, is that we could<br>have generated a lot of cash in a given quarter but historically if it was all generated overseas, we couldn't use any of the cash to delever. So while<br>tax reform is quite likely hurting us on the tax rate side, it's giving us a lot more flexibility to move capital around where we need it and keep debt<br>at the lowest levels possible. So we've always had a grossed up balance sheet, if you will, with hundreds of millions of cash and then a larger sum<br>of debt. Those days are fortunately over. We'll still hold onto some cash on our balance sheet to cover our day-to-day business, but we don't need<br>to cover -- to carry any more than that anymore. So that's as I said in my script if we are making investments, tax reform and a lower corporate tax<br>rate in the U.S. makes U.S. investments a lot more attractive. So anyway, I hope that answers your question.<br>
<b>Kevin Wallace Sterling</b> - Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division - Former MD &amp; Senior Analyst<br>
Yes, it does. And so speaking of like those investments and stuff and you guys have taken a little bit of hiatus from M&amp;A. How does your pipeline<br>look right now? And as you kind of, I guess, reinvent yourselves, if you will, can we see you back on the M&amp;A train as you take advantage of your<br>lower debt levels and the tax rate?<br>

<b>Michael J. Kasbar</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Yes.<br>
<b>Kevin Wallace Sterling</b> - Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division - Former MD &amp; Senior Analyst<br>
Okay.<br>
<b>Michael J. Kasbar</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
People tell me that they prefer short answers, so the answer to that questions is yes.<br>
<b>Kevin Wallace Sterling</b> - Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division - Former MD &amp; Senior Analyst<br>
It can't get any much shorter than that, Mike. But the pipeline is pretty robust?<br>
<b>Michael J. Kasbar</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Yes. Certainly, land, as I've said this before, it's a very sizable market. Our intention obviously is to build density, particularly when you're in a<br>distribution business, that's critically important. We have perhaps a unique feature of that, we have a global network. There aren't too many folks<br>in the world that have our spread of geography where we truly understand the markets and certainly the distillate markets by virtue of our jet fuel<br>in so many different countries. So we're still bullish on going global. Our Kinect business is truly a global business and Marine and aviation. Multi<br>Service is active in more and more countries. Their clients look to take them in more countries. So -- any case, land is certainly sizable. I'd love to<br>acquire within the FinTech space with Multi Service, if had to turn the clock back, we would have bought 3, 4, 5 companies within that and bulk<br>that business up. Kinect, we feel very bullish about in that area. Marine, it's interesting, we feel like we could look at that many number of different<br>ways. And aviation, still has a good amount of runway in it. We're happy with all of the acquisitions we've done there. And I think, if you want to<br>look at it and going back to Ken's question, having a platform makes all the difference. And so, we are getting a lot more serious about our land<br>platform. It's very high on our list of priorities that kind of tough to really get the value out of businesses if you can't do the plug-and-play. But now,<br>you made me give you a long answer, Kevin. But in any case, there is no shortage in organic growth opportunities that are intelligent when you<br>look at our business, we have a fairly broad chassis. We've got a broad geography. So our opportunity for growth and profitable growth is good,<br>but we have to do a couple of things before we could do that, the right way, we're building it step-by-step.<br>
<b>Kevin Wallace Sterling</b> - Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division - Former MD &amp; Senior Analyst<br>
Got you. I like your long answers, it's good detail for me. Another point, and if I'm remembering correctly, a few years ago, I remember, you guys<br>had a similar issue you had in aviation this quarter, where I think at the end of the quarter, fuel spiked and you kind of got caught on the wrong<br>side and your hedges didn't work. Am I thinking about that right? I think it's happened to you before. And then point number two, do you still --<br>is it black oil futures you sold as your hedge against jet fuel inventory?<br>
<b>Ira M. Birns</b> - World Fuel Services Corporation - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
It's heating oil. So historically, heating oil and jet fuel are very tightly correlated and heating oil is the liquid market to hedge because there's no<br>real liquid market to hedge jet fuel directly. What you're referring to, Kevin, is true. It's actually happened several times in the 10, 11 years that I've<br>been here. And it's not that the hedges didn't work, at least the $7 million item that I referred to. It's simply because of the inventory methodology<br>we utilized, we wind up with hedges that are intended to cover our risk being on the wrong side because in this example, prices spike. The assumption<br>is that you're covering your risk from prices going down and your inventory being valued too high when you're trying to sell it off to customers.<br>This is the opposite side, so the assumption is that you've got some extra profit on your inventory. So you've got a liability on the hedge side, right?<br>

The problem is the liability of the hedge side happens at the end of the year when you mark your hedges to market and the pickup. Because all<br>this happened at the very end of the year, you don't see that until you start selling that inventory a few weeks later, which has a lower cost basis.<br>So you make the profit back because prices are higher, right? So that's something that we're still exploring. There are potential opportunities to<br>change the inventory methodology that we utilize today, which could reduce that risk going forward. There is some technological requirements<br>to do that and we may actually get there in 2018, more news to follow there. So we always have run the risk of that happening historically. The<br>good news is, those aren't lost dollars, right? The dollars tend to come right back when the inventory is sold, which is exactly what happened in<br>this case.<br>

<b>Anthony Ambrose</b> - Data I/O Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thank you very much, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by commenting on 2017's fourth quarter and full year results, and our<br>outlook on the overall market, and then I'll turn it over to our CFO, Joel Hatlen for more detail on the numbers, including some more detail specifics<br>on the recent tax law changes and their impact to Data I/O.<br>
2017 fourth quarter highlights include $7.6 million in bookings which represent an 11-year high for us in the fourth quarter. Revenues were $8.1<br>million, another multiyear high for us in the fourth quarter. We had continued strength in our automotive and programming center segments, and<br>also realized our first revenue from the SentriX security provisioning platform. Once again, our operations delivered a very strong performance,<br>

supporting backlog in new orders as well as collecting on receivables. We ended the year with $18.5 million in cash. We also received our ISO<br>9001-2015 certification for both our Redmond and China manufacturing locations.<br>
Net income for the quarter was $1.5 million, including the onetime benefit from tax reform, and again, I'll let Joel talk more specifically about the<br>tax benefits later on.<br>
When we look at the full year for 2017, it was one of those years where everything aligned very well for us. We had strong market conditions, the<br>right products and outstanding execution across the company. These results that we enjoyed in 2017 are the result of our multiyear plan and the<br>hard work of all of our Data I/O employees and partners. For the full year, revenues of $34 million were the highest level in 17 years, and this<br>represents our fifth consecutive year of revenue growth. We also had $34 million in bookings, which also represented the highest level in 17 years.<br>
Net income for the year tripled to $5.4 million, and this represents about $0.65 per diluted share, including effects from the recently passed tax<br>legislation. Automotive bookings for the year were up 46%, and now represent over half of our orders at 54%. Programming centers grew 20% in<br>2017, following a very strong 2016. 24% of our orders went to the programming center market. We also continued our growth in our new products.<br>We've shipped over 180 PSV family automated programming systems through 2017, and our operating model continued to perform exceptionally<br>well. Our gross margins for the year were 58.5%, growing substantially over the last 4 years.<br>
Switching now to our long-term outlook. When we sat here 2 years ago and discussed results, we reviewed our long-term market forecast, which<br>at the time showed us looking at a doubling of our available market for Data I/O in 5 years, or about 15% per year compounded from 2016 through<br>2020. We discussed how this was driven by automotive electronics, the Internet of Things and factory automation. I think it's time to update our<br>-- look at that and take a look at our progress on that long-range outlook.<br>
From 2015 to 2017, our revenue increased by about 55%. Our bookings in automotive more than doubled during this time, and our bookings in<br>programming centers also more than doubled during this time period. We grew substantially faster than our industry in the past 2 years. And as I<br>mentioned earlier, automotive now represents over half of our revenue and programming centers represent about 1/4 of our revenue. Our long-term<br>thesis about automotive growth is unchanged. As we said before, we're in the midst of new and exciting electronic content, including automotive<br>infotainment and instrument cluster applications, Advanced Driver Assist Systems that come and support both autonomous driving and connected<br>car strategies from all of the leading automotive OEMs. We plan continued investments in the automotive space in all areas of our business:<br>Programming technology, handling technology, systems integration, factory automation software, global service and support, marketing and<br>sales.<br>
Industry forecast from leading automotive OEMs show about a 10% to 15% compounded annual growth rate for semiconductor content in cars,<br>and a larger increase of about a 30% compounded annual growth rate in the total market for flash memory in cars, growing to about 1 terabyte<br>or more of flash memory in the next 7 to 8 years. Leading-industry flash memory suppliers are also planning to migrate from the current standard<br>called eMMC to UFS interfaces in cars. We recently announced our UFS solution for automotive and have already earned our first customer. We've<br>also mapped out a multiyear strategy to maintain industry leadership in automotive and keep our customers competitive as their flash demand<br>sharply increases.<br>
The IoT market continues to grow but is lagging today in security solutions. The opportunity for Data I/O is to simplify the security provisioning<br>process and make solutions available to customers of all sizes. To simplify security provisioning, we've developed the SentriX security platform.<br>We're investing to lead the industry here in the potential market of nearly 4 billion units in the next 5 years according to ABI Research. We've been<br>very successful partnering with the leading silicon suppliers of authentication ICs and secure microcontrollers. As you probably noticed, we've<br>made several recent announcements in this area, and expect more in the next week as part of the Embedded World event in Germany. We're also<br>working with leading tools and security software suppliers in this ecosystem to simplify and streamline the security process for IoT devices.<br>
Given the traditionally long lead times for new designs, 2018 will continue to be primarily a market development year for SentriX. We're very pleased<br>with the progress made to date, which includes our first deployment and initial revenue generation from this SentriX system.<br>

We're continuing to see automation replacing manual programming in most global markets. This is driven by labor costs, reduced component size<br>and increasing quality demands worldwide. We're investing in software and systems integration capabilities to accelerate the move to automation<br>and support major global initiatives, such as Industry 4.0 and the China Smart Factory.<br>
For our 2018 growth outlook, we see signs that our largest programming center customers are still absorbing capacity purchase last year and will<br>not be adding new capacity at the same rate as the past 2 years.<br>
The test industry, which may also provide some useful comparisons, is forecasting a moderation of growth as well in 2018. Furthermore, we saw<br>a return to more seasonal patterns at the end of Q4 and the start of 2018, and our order patterns can be lumpy from time to time. We start the year<br>with about $4 million in backlog and we anticipate the systems in backlog will become revenue in 2018. We also expect gross margins this year<br>will remain in the mid-to-high 50% range, depending on revenue mix, factory utilization and sales channels.<br>
We expect an increase in our overall spending, primarily in R&amp;D and marketing, to support our automotive and Managed and Secure Programming<br>initiatives. At the same time, we remain vigilant in looking at ways to reduce our ongoing operating costs. We have kicked off internal programs<br>to reduce material COGS by another $500,000 over the next 2 years, with some of that benefit planned for 2018. We start the year with over $18<br>million in cash and no debt.<br>
As it was discussed on my blog at www.dataio.com, 2018 will be the year of security and the year the UFS starts the transition in automotive<br>electronics. We plan to extend our lead in both. I'd like to now turn over the call to Joel Hatlen, to discuss our -- in more detail the numbers. Joel?<br>
<b>Joel S. Hatlen</b> - Data I/O Corporation - Chief Operating &amp; Financial Officer, VP of Operations &amp; Finance, Treasurer and Secretary<br>
Thank you, Anthony. Good day, everyone. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $8.1 million as compared with $6.4 million for the<br>period last year. As Anthony noted, the 26% year-over-year increase was primarily a result of automotive electronics demands from both OEM and<br>programming centers, primarily related to our PSV family of programming systems. Revenues from adapters increased $212,000, or 14% from the<br>year-earlier period. Total revenue was comprised of capital equipment, 70%; adapters, 22% and software, 8% in the fourth quarter. On a geographic<br>basis, international revenue represented approximately 92% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with 88% in the fourth<br>quarter of 2016. Revenue growth was the strongest in the Americas, which increased 59% from the prior year. In Europe, revenue grew by 24%<br>year-over-year while Asia experienced a 12% increase. Order bookings were $7.6 million in the fourth quarter, which is an 11-year high for the<br>company, and an increase of 4% from the same period of the prior year. The variation in revenue percentages versus order percentages relate to<br>changes in backlog, deferred revenues and currency translation.<br>
Data I/O had $1.8 million in deferred revenue at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.6 million at the end of the third quarter, and<br>compared to $1.9 million at the end of the prior year. Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4 million compared to $4.6 million at<br>the end of the third quarter of 2017, and $3.2 million at prior year end.<br>
For the fourth quarter of 2017, gross margin, as a percentage of sales, was 58.5% compared to 56.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase<br>was primarily due to sales volume, which resulted in better fact -- fixed factory cost utilization, along with a favorable product mix, a favorable<br>channel mix, and reduced unfavorable factory variances. Throughout the year, our manufacturing teams in both Redmond and China continued<br>to demonstrate operational excellence in execution in a virtually investment-free delivery of increases in capacity during the year.<br>
Operation -- operating expenses were $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $3 million in the same period of 2016. The increase<br>was due to additional engineering and R&amp;D spending of approximately $356,000 associated primarily with our new security provisioning or SentriX<br>platform, and other automotive-related technology innovations. R&amp;D increased 25% for the fourth quarter year-over-year, although as a percentage<br>of sales, the expense category was marginally lower. Sales and marketing expenses increased $204,000, or 27% for the fourth quarter year-over-year,<br>which reflects higher sales levels as well as our heightened efforts in promoting our new security provisioning solution. Included in sales and<br>marketing are variable incentives, sales and commission compensation, along with additional trade show and other marketing activities.<br>

General and administration expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $851,000, essentially flat with $850,000 in the prior year period. As a<br>percentage of revenues, operating expense categories were lower this year as compared to the prior year period. As compared to the third quarter<br>of 2017, total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined, due in part to revenue level and a return to more normal channel mix,<br>resulting in less commissions and incentive compensation.<br>
In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.5 million, or $0.18 per<br>diluted share compared with net income of $755,000, or $0.09 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in the fourth quarter of<br>2017 net income is a net benefit of $531,000 from the recent tax reform. Included in nonoperating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was a<br>gain of $140,000 for sales of non-core internet domain assets. Excluding the Q4 tax reform benefit and the Q4 '16 nonoperating income gain,<br>non-GAAP net income was $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an improvement of $390,000, or 63%, from the non-GAAP net income of $615,000<br>in the fourth quarter of 2016. EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, another non-GAAP measure, was approximately<br>$1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to EBITDA of $962,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016.<br>
Equity compensation expense, a noncash item, in the fourth quarter of 2017 and '16 respectively, was $174,000 and $111,000. Adjusted EBITDA,<br>excluding equity compensation, was approximately $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of<br>2016.<br>
Please see our press release or SEC filings for discussion and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures.<br>
Now let's move on to the discussion of our annual financial performance. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net sales were $34.1 million,<br>increasing $10.7 million or 45% compared with $23.4 million in 2016. International sales were approximately 92% of total revenue in 2017 compared<br>with 87.5% of total revenue for 2016. For the entire year of 2017, bookings were $34.3 million compared to $26.9 million in 2016. These increases<br>are due to the same factors discussed previously for both the fourth quarter and in Anthony's discussion.<br>
Gross margin of $20.1 million, or 58.9% as a percentage of sales for all of 2017 increased from $12.9 million, or 55% in the prior year. Operating<br>income for 2017 was $5 million, an increase of approximately $3.6 million or 254% from $1.4 million for all of 2016.<br>
The balance of our income statement and non-GAAP performance measures on a comparative annual basis are included in our press release. In<br>summary, our expense categories, while up in dollars as a percentage of sales, were each down in 2017 compared with 2016, and our operating<br>and net profit on a dollar basis tripled.<br>
Now I would like to talk about the tax reform impact for Data I/O. As you know, on December 22 of 2017, the U.S. government signed into law, the<br>Tax Cut -- the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which among other things reduced the federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January<br>1, 2018. The impact from tax reform may differ from our estimates due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions or<br>further guidance that maybe issued. Our initial assessment is complete, and we recorded a $531,000 net benefit in our fourth quarter of 2017<br>results. This was made up of $67,000 of additional tax relating to the deemed repatriation of previously deferred foreign subsidiary, post-1986<br>earnings and profits and recognizing a tax benefit of $598,000 relating to refundable alternative minimum tax credits and carryforward. We have<br>approximately $13 million of U.S. net operating losses in carryforward at December 31, 2017, as well as other credit carryforwards in the United<br>States that are available to continue to offset our future U.S. net income. And we will continue to analyze and manage taxes to take advantage of<br>these tax attributes, particularly amid the recent tax reforms.<br>
On other balance sheet performance matters, receivables of $3.8 million at the end of 2017 were reduced from $5.2 million at the end of the third<br>quarter, as well as from $4.7 million at the end of 2016. Day sales outstanding were very good at 45 days, down from 61 days at the end of the third<br>quarter. The company's cash position as a result, at December 31, 2017, was $18.5 million, up $7 million from the end of the prior year as compared<br>with the $15.2 million at September 30th of 2017. $12.4 million of our cash was in the United States and the balance in foreign subsidiaries.<br>
No actual cash movements took place as part of the tax reform deemed dividend. Working capital was $19.5 million at the end of 2017, an<br>improvement from $18.4 million at the end of the third quarter and $14.6 million at the end of last year. As a reminder, in the first quarter of each<br>year, Data I/O typically pays a good portion of its annual public company operating cost as well as satisfying any cash payments from annual<br>

With that, I'll turn the call back to Anthony.<br>
<b>Anthony Ambrose</b> - Data I/O Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Thank you, Joel. Before we open up for questions, I just like to remind everyone that we will be at 2 trade shows next week. If you're in the San<br>Diego area, please come see us at the IPC APEX EXPO. And if you're in the Nuremberg, Germany area, please come see us at Embedded World. We'll<br>also be attending the ROTH Investment Conference, March 12 in Orange County, California, and you can talk to Jordan if you want more details<br>on that.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Jaeson -- excuse me, Jaeson Schmidt with Lake Street Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Jaeson Allen Min Schmidt</b> - Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst<br>
The first one for me, really just wondering if you could comment on your visibility for the year, and if you've seen any improvement in that visibility<br>over the past 3 months or so?<br>
<b>Anthony Ambrose</b> - Data I/O Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Jaeson. Yes, the visibility for the year, we typically don't have great visibility for any period 12 months in advance. It's just the nature of our business.<br>We tend to be closing a significant amount of book and ship within one quarter. We -- so I'll leave that as the comment for 2018. I'd just bring your<br>attention back to what I said earlier about, we like the long-term trends in automotive and security for IoT, and we think some of our programming<br>centers might be digesting some capacity that they brought in 2017.<br>
<b>Jaeson Allen Min Schmidt</b> - Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst<br>
Okay. That's helpful. And then just following up on those comments. It does sound like you're incrementally more bullish on the bigger-picture<br>trends in the industry. Just curious if you think the general tailwinds are stronger in the industry, or some of this increased bullishness is really due<br>to you guys' ability to gain share.<br>
<b>Anthony Ambrose</b> - Data I/O Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Well, I think -- two years ago, we said we liked the automotive industry. We even kicked off a program internally called Automotive First to align<br>our processes top to bottom to being very successful on automotive, and growing 126% or so in a couple of years, I think, shows we had our eye<br>on the right market there. Everything that I read and see and talk to our customers about indicates that the fundamental long-term trends in<br>automotive are still present. They need more flash memory across the car. Mercedes-Benz highlighted this at an investor and technology event<br>last summer, where they talked about getting to 1 terabyte per car by 2025. I've seen numbers even double that number. You back that out, you<br>get about a 30% compounded annual growth rate in the flash demand in a car. We've talked about the Internet of Things, security markets, talking<br>

about authentication ICs growing as well as a new category of products called secure microcontrollers. There's been some new research published<br>there by a company called ABI out of the U.K., and that's where we get our 4 billion unit TAM in about 5 years. You've also seen some of the<br>announcements and relationships we've made. Recently, including this week, we'll also have additional announcements to make around Embedded<br>World, so stay tuned to the channel. So we've hitched our wagon to those 2 markets long term. And so that's where we're bullish. In our business,<br>there is never anything that goes up in a straight line, but we think we're in the right markets long term, and we're investing accordingly.<br>
<b>Jaeson Allen Min Schmidt</b> - Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And then the last one for me and I'll jump back in the queue. I know you mentioned you expect to increase some spending this year, given<br>the initiatives in the pipeline. Just curious, should we be thinking about building off the depressed Q4 level of OpEx? Or the higher Q3 level?<br>
<b>Anthony Ambrose</b> - Data I/O Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Joel, go ahead on that one.<br>
<b>Joel S. Hatlen</b> - Data I/O Corporation - Chief Operating &amp; Financial Officer, VP of Operations &amp; Finance, Treasurer and Secretary<br>
I basically look mostly at the Q4 level. That's pretty much the best fact produced from an extrapolation standpoint.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
We go now to James Anderson at R.F. Lafferty.<br>
<b>James Anderson</b> - R.F. Lafferty &amp; Co., Inc., Research Division - Former Research Analyst<br>
I had a question about the cash position of the company. You guys seem to be pretty heavily cash flow-positive at this point and are accumulating<br>quite a hefty amount of cash at $18.5 million. Do you guys have any plans to put this to use in terms of creating values for the shareholder or<br>initiatives you guys might have in the near- to mid-term?<br>
<b>Joel S. Hatlen</b> - Data I/O Corporation - Chief Operating &amp; Financial Officer, VP of Operations &amp; Finance, Treasurer and Secretary<br>
Joel, I guess I wanted to say to start off by saying that I'm really pleased at our cash level. But we believe that we actually collect receivables and<br>liquidated inventory much better than we traditionally have been able to do, so I'm expecting that we'll have to deploy some more cash as working<br>capital. The other piece is we do have fairly hefty amounts of accrued expenses that we're reading into year-end incentives and accrued pension<br>and things like that. So I'm expecting a couple of million dollars to go out in the first quarter relating to that in particular. So -- but beyond that, we<br>wouldn't really comment with regard to our planned uses of cash until we actually have something to say.<br>
<b>James Anderson</b> - R.F. Lafferty &amp; Co., Inc., Research Division - Former Research Analyst<br>
Okay, great. And then on the NOLs, with the $13 million of American NOLs, can you guys give any color on how you plan to use it? Obviously, you<br>guys are still digesting the new tax code and the implications of that. But the rate at which you're planning to apply it, would that be similar to<br>2017? Or significantly different?<br>

<b>Joel S. Hatlen</b> - Data I/O Corporation - Chief Operating &amp; Financial Officer, VP of Operations &amp; Finance, Treasurer and Secretary<br>
I'm not sure if I exactly know how to answer this question but the answer from my standpoint is that we continue to expect that we will use NOLs<br>to offset our income, and we will continue to have similar taxes being generated in our foreign subsidiaries. So we'll have a continued blended tax<br>rate as a result. We now no longer have the alternative minimum tax, which has driven part of our U.S. taxes in the past. So that's going to be<br>something good. We have not figured out too much how the GILTI or other international tax things from tax reform really are going to impact our<br>2018 results yet. So that's a wait to come, and we'll talk about that more at the first quarter results.<br>
<b>James Anderson</b> - R.F. Lafferty &amp; Co., Inc., Research Division - Former Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And with the development of the UFS flash capabilities, you mentioned that you'd seen some interest from your customers. Obviously, you<br>guys do business with the top automotive manufacturers. Can you give a little bit more color on what that's been like, on their interest level?<br>
<b>Anthony Ambrose</b> - Data I/O Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
Sure, James. So when you look at it -- just step back so the -- without getting into too much on technology -- the memory market for the technology<br>is used in a lot of infotainment, navigation systems, things like that in cars that tend to be the big consumers of flash capacity. They've used the<br>technology interface, which is called eMMC. It's just the abbreviation for the current technology standard. The new technology standard is called<br>UFS. And so you're beginning to see new designs look at UFS. And this is not something that happens overnight, nobody snaps their fingers and<br>suddenly everybody migrates. But UFS has some benefits, especially in terms of overall performance and I'll call it snappiness of the interface. And<br>so we would expect more automotive customers to be investigating that. We also are in constant discussion with memory companies about what<br>they think their marketing mix is going to be. And obviously, they have a pretty good idea of what they're going to sell. So over time, I think you'll<br>see the migration to UFS. It's very important for us to be out in the market now, because as customers go in their early designs and take months<br>to take a design from production -- sorry, early production to pilot production to full production -- we can be there with them the whole step of<br>the way or every step of the way with their design process. So we like the technology. We're very happy to have a product. We're very happy to<br>have earned our first customer in UFS, and we'll be there with the market for both eMMC and UFS solutions in automotive.<br>
<b>James Anderson</b> - R.F. Lafferty &amp; Co., Inc., Research Division - Former Research Analyst<br>
New products and rollouts, you mentioned that you're still sort of in the market development phase for the SentriX, IoTC -- the IoT secure provisioning.<br>As the IoT marketplace develops that -- the need for security will become apparent fairly quickly and then, as a result, the SentriX's demand will be<br>fueled by that. Can you give us a little bit more of an idea of how we should expect SentriX to affect revenue in 2018? Or is that something we<br>should be looking at for 2019?<br>
<b>Anthony Ambrose</b> - Data I/O Corporation - President, CEO &amp; Director<br>
That's a good point. The -- so if we look at SentriX, what we're doing is we're giving customers the opportunity to provision the security credentials<br>into their products one unit at a time. What that effectively means is that they can take a technology that's very useful today in things like smart<br>cards or cellular phones, and now they can deploy that key and certificate technology into IoT devices. The way that works is each semiconductor<br>company lets you put those keys and certificates in, in slightly different ways. So what we've been doing, at first, is to work with the leading suppliers<br>in these markets for authentication ICs and secure microcontrollers to make sure that we support their products. And it's substantially more complex<br>to do that support than it is for a data-only programming support. Given that and given that there is some new products coming out -- and I'd<br>encourage all of you to look and see what comes out of Embedded World next week in the silicone industry -- we're well positioned with those<br>firms in the silicon space, but they have to go get design wins and began shipping products to their customers. And the embedded cycles are just<br>anywhere between 6 and 18 months. So that's why my comments earlier reflected that we still think 2018 from a modeling standpoint is still<br>predominantly a market development year for SentriX. And you should treat it that way in your models.<br>

(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Robert Anderson with Penbrook.<br>
<b>Robert Stephen Anderson</b> - Penbrook Management LLC - Co-Founder<br>
Joel, can you hear me?<br>
<b>Joel S. Hatlen</b> - Data I/O Corporation - Chief Operating &amp; Financial Officer, VP of Operations &amp; Finance, Treasurer and Secretary<br>
Yes, I can.<br>
<b>Robert Stephen Anderson</b> - Penbrook Management LLC - Co-Founder<br>
I just had a question on how we should look at earnings per share in the quarter. Obviously, you have that $500,000 benefit. So from a security<br>analyst point of view, you really earned $0.12 in the fourth quarter, backing that out. And I just want to make sure I understand the comparison:<br>The prior year was $0.09, but that had an extra in it of $140,000. So was $0.12 versus $0.08 a reasonable comparison on an operating basis?<br>
<b>Joel S. Hatlen</b> - Data I/O Corporation - Chief Operating &amp; Financial Officer, VP of Operations &amp; Finance, Treasurer and Secretary<br>
If you're looking at the quarters, those are correct. If you're looking at the year, then 2017 actually had $366,000 of those same internet at risk sales<br>that represented $140,000 in 2016. So just a little bit more of a difference there but you have the right idea.<br>
<b>Robert Stephen Anderson</b> - Penbrook Management LLC - Co-Founder<br>
And so then what would be the adjusted earnings per share for the year, backing out these one timers?<br>
<b>Joel S. Hatlen</b> - Data I/O Corporation - Chief Operating &amp; Financial Officer, VP of Operations &amp; Finance, Treasurer and Secretary<br>
Let me calculate that for you, and I'll get right back to you.<br>

Greetings, and welcome to the Empire State Realty Trust Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2017 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As<br>a reminder, this conference is being recorded.<br>
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Thomas Keltner, Executive Vice President and General Counsel at Empire State Realty Trust.<br>
Thank you, Mr. Keltner, you may begin.<br>
<b>Thomas N. Keltner</b> - Empire State Building Associates LLC - Member<br>
Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Empire State Realty Trust Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. In addition to the press<br>release distributed last evening, a quarterly supplemental package with further details on our results has been posted in the Investor section of<br>the company's website at empirestaterealtytrust.com. On today's call, management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain<br>forward-looking statements as defined in applicable securities laws, including those related to market conditions, property operations, capital<br>expenditures, income and expense. As a reminder, forward-looking statements represent management's current estimates. They are subject to<br>risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results from -- to differ from those discussed today. Empire State Realty Trust assumes no obligation<br>to update any forward-looking statement in the future. We encourage listeners to review the more detailed discussions related to these<br>forward-looking statements in the company's filings with the SEC. Finally, during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures,<br>such as FFO, modified and core FFO, NOI, cash NOI and EBITDA, which we believe are meaningful in evaluating the company's performance. The<br>definitions and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and<br>supplemental package, each available on the company's website.<br>
Now I would turn the call over to John Kessler, President and Chief Operating Officer.<br>
<b>John B. Kessler</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
Good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Empire State Realty Trust is a pure play Manhattan and greater New<br>York metro area office and retail portfolio.<br>

<A name=670></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, ESRT - Q4 2017 Empire State Realty Trust Inc Earnings Call<br>
Our focus remains on our long-stated plans to redevelop our well-located portfolio and deliver embedded derisk growth, and maintain flexibility<br>for external growth through a strong, flexible and low levered balance sheet.<br>
In the fourth quarter, we signed approximately 275,000 square feet of leases and saw steady demand for our well located, fully modernized for the<br>21st Century buildings, at our value price point.<br>
2017 leasing volume set a record for us.<br>
In the fourth quarter, we achieved average leasing spreads of 33.9% on new Manhattan office leases and 26.8% on all new and renewal leases<br>across our entire portfolio.<br>
Moving to our balance sheet. During the quarter, we entered into an agreement to issue and sell $450 million of long-tenured attractively priced<br>unsecured notes in a private placement.<br>
As a result of certain financing transactions completed subsequent to quarter end, we have now fully addressed all of our 2018 maturities through<br>a combination of mortgage payoffs and refinancings.<br>
We manage our balance sheet to enable future growth and to create value for shareholders.<br>
This morning, Tom Durels will provide an update on our portfolio including much more detail on our record leasing and how much space we plan<br>to vacate and redevelop. And then David Karp will review financial results in more detail and provide more information for you to model 2018 and<br>beyond.<br>
After that, our team including Tony Melton, are here to answer your questions.<br>
I'll now turn the call over to Tom Durels. Tom?<br>
<b>Thomas P. Durels</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - EVP of Real Estate<br>
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone.<br>
Throughout 2017, I reported that we had steady demand and that led to a record leasing year. Thus far in the first quarter of 2018, we continue to<br>see steady demand.<br>
We feel really good about our differentiated product type, our price points, our locations and the brokers and tenants we are attracting.<br>
On today's call, I will provide you with an update on our 4 key growth drivers. Review our leasing activity in the fourth quarter and full year, give<br>an overview of our current and future space availabilities and discuss some of our recent redevelopment work.<br>
To make things easier and cut the length of these calls, certain areas of my quarterly update can now be found in our supplemental.<br>
Our fourth quarter numbers reflect further progress on our 4 long-term growth drivers, which are one, upside from signed leases not commenced<br>of $17 million and burn off of free rent of $26 million, which together, total approximately $43 million of contracted growth. Two, lease up of<br>developed vacant office space of $26 million; three, the mark-to-market on our expiring Manhattan office leases of $18 million; and four, the<br>mark-to-market and lease-up of available retail space of $10 million.<br>
Based on these updated numbers, we estimate these drivers will contribute approximately $97 million of revenue growth over the next 5 to 6 years<br>December 31, 2017. Relative to our trailing 12 months cash NOI of $381 million.<br>

<hr>
<A name=671></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, ESRT - Q4 2017 Empire State Realty Trust Inc Earnings Call<br>
In the fourth quarter, we signed 55 new and renewal leases totaling approximately 275,000 square feet. This included approximately 214,000 square<br>feet in our Manhattan office properties, 38,000 square feet in our greater New York metropolitan office properties and 23,000 square feet of retail.<br>
This brings our 2017 total to 167 new and renewal leases for a company record of approximately 1.29 million square feet.<br>
Significant office leases signed during the quarter include Universal Music Group, PVH, Hoguet Newman and MSG ventures.<br>
And subsequent to quarter end, we signed a new office lease with Uber for a full floor of approximately 35,000 square feet at 1400 Broadway. To<br>make this lease, the prior tenant made payments to terminate its lease early, which allowed us to avoid future downtime and capture revenue<br>while we achieved a 9% positive mark-to-market increase of starting rent over prior fully escalated rent.<br>
Our redevelopment strategy allows us to continue to capture healthy rental growth spreads. During the fourth quarter, rental rates on new and<br>renewal leases across our entire portfolio were 26.8% higher on a cash basis compared to prior escalated rents.<br>
And that our Manhattan office properties, we signed new leases at positive rent spread of 33.9%.<br>
For this quarter and going forward, we will provide detail on our vacancy in our supplemental.<br>
Here are some highlights for our portfolio as of December 31 of 2017.<br>
We had a net total of 792,000 square feet of unleased space, which is comprised of Manhattan office vacancy of 595,000 square feet.<br>
Retail vacancy of 44,000 square feet and greater New York metropolitan office vacancy of 153,000 square feet.<br>
Of the 595,000 square feet of unleased Manhattan office space, approximately 425,000 square feet is consolidated and redeveloped prebuilt and<br>white-boxed space ready for lease up.<br>
Within our Manhattan office portfolio, we currently have available 8 full floors ranging in size from 8,500 square feet to our largest single floor of<br>42,000 square feet.<br>
These 8 floors total 145,000 square feet and include 3 floors at 111 West 33rd Street, 2 floors at 250 West 57th Street and 1 floor each at 1350<br>Broadway, 1400 Broadway and 1 Grand Central Place.<br>
We expect our occupancy will go up and down as we continue our strategy to deliver derisked embedded growth and we vacate and consolidate<br>spaces and redevelop and release those spaces at higher rents to get better tenants.<br>
In 2018, we expect to vacate an additional 700,000 square feet. Roughly 2/3 of this space is taken offline in the first half of 2018.<br>
We expect year-end occupancy to be lower than when we started the year.<br>
As we have shown quarter-over-quarter when we redevelop, we lease up at materially higher rents.<br>
This space represents in place fully escalated rents of $49.34 per square foot portfolio wide. Similar to the recent lease with Uber, we are also actively<br>working on opportunities to take back underutilized space that we can in turn lease directly to new or expanding tenants at higher rents.<br>
As always, there is a timing lag between the move outs of existing tenants and when new leases commence, which impacts revenue.<br>
In addition, there is a timing lag between legal commencement and GAAP revenue recognition.<br>

Turning to our retail business. We signed a significantly lease with T.J. Maxx for a 19,000 square-foot full floor expansion and overall lease extension<br>at 250 West 57th Street during the fourth quarter, and T.J. Maxx now leases a total of 47,000 square feet.<br>
Our street retail portfolio located in high-traffic areas with excellent -- within excellent submarkets is 92% occupied and 93.9% leased and strong<br>execution on leasing results delivered by our team has positioned us well with only 8% of our retail spaces expiring in the next 2 years.<br>
As previously announced at the Empire State building. For the first time since the buildings opening, a gut redevelopment of all retail space is<br>underway.<br>
The first phase on 33rd Street has been successfully completed, will be vacated and 100% released approximately 21,000 square feet at grade and<br>9,200 square feet on the second floor to Walgreens, Juice Press, Starbucks, Sushi-teria, Chopped, STATE Grill and Bar and most recently Tacombi.<br>
Phase II on the 34th Street is in progress where we have vacant and are currently marketing 7,900 square feet on grade and 18,000 square feet of<br>contiguous concourse space.<br>
By December 31 of 2019, we anticipate we will have another 6,700 square feet at grade, 12,000 square feet on concourse and 5,000 square feet on<br>the second floor vacant for redevelopment.<br>
As we have stated before, our new 34th Street Observatory entrance will bring 4 million plus visitors annually, past our stores there and enhance<br>the value of all of our 34th Street retail space.<br>
We remain very confident about our leasing pipeline and in our team's ability to execute. Demand for a well-located and amenity-rich properties<br>is steady as we continue our proven strategy to consolidate, vacate and deliver redeveloped space and lease to new, better credit tenants at higher<br>rents.<br>
It's a reminder, please remember to review our supplemental for information historically provided in this call.<br>
Now I'll turn the call over to David Karp. David?<br>
<b>David A. Karp</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone.<br>
For the fourth quarter, we reported Core FFO of $74.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share.<br>
Cash NOI was $99.7 million, up 2.5% from the prior-year period.<br>
For the full year 2017, Core FFO was $286.9 million or $0.96 per diluted share, which includes approximately $0.045 per diluted share of lease<br>termination income. This was partially offset by the right-off of straight line rent receivables associated with the terminated leases of approximately<br>$0.05 per share. And of course we have reduction in rental revenue from these terminated leases until such time as revenue commences on<br>replacement leases.<br>
Cash NOI was $381 million, up 7% from the prior-year period.<br>
In the first quarter of 2017, we changed our revenue recognition practices for leases in which the tenant constructs tenant improvements in which<br>we share the funding obligation.<br>
We recognize rental revenue at the earlier of cash rent commencement or completion of tenant improvements.<br>

This new accounting practice resulted in approximately $1.6 million less revenue for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to the practice in place for<br>the prior-year period.<br>
This practice does not represent a reduction in lease revenue but does represent a delay in the GAAP commencement date for new leases, which<br>will continue to have an impact into 2018 and beyond.<br>
This quarter, we added to our supplemental disclosure to assist the investment community to model better our business.<br>
Specifically, we now break out the current year's lease expirations by quarter. We reformatted our quarterly NOI, cash NOI and leasing activity data<br>into a consolidated growing 5 quarter format for easier trend analysis. We added the number and the impact of bad weather days on Observatory<br>attendance.<br>
We provided a detailed schedule of signed leases not commenced and we have added in the detail vacancy breakdown Tom cited earlier.<br>
Moving to our Observatory operations. Revenue for the fourth quarter 2017 declined 2.4% to $32.9 million from the prior-year period.<br>
Supported by lower operating expenses, NOI was $25.7 million essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter 2016.<br>
The Observatory hosted approximately 1.01 million visitors in the fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of 5.1% compared to the fourth quarter 2016.<br>
For the full year 2017, the Observatory hosted approximately 4.05 million visitors, down 4.6% compared to the prior-year period.<br>
Observatory revenue was $127.1 million, up 1.8% compared to the prior-year period while net operating income grew 2% to $96.8 million from<br>the prior-year period.<br>
As a reminder, we always look at the Observatory's results on a holistic annual basis.<br>
Keeping that perspective, we are pleased with the revenue and NOI improvement we reported in 2017.<br>
A combination of active revenue management through ticket price increases, dynamic pricing, mix improvement and new visitor offerings such<br>as the AM/PM experience along with expense management offset the impact of fewer visitors.<br>
In connection with the elevator modernization at the Empire State Building, the elevator servicing the 102nd floor will be impacted with the result<br>of the 102nd floor Observatory will be closed to visitors for the first quarter of 2018.<br>
As a point of reference, sales for the 102nd floor were approximately $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.<br>
Turning to our broadcast business. As we discussed last quarter, we have essentially concluded our negotiations with current operators.<br>
Based on the agreements we have completed and which we have discussed previously, we expect that our broadcast revenue inclusive of tenant<br>reimbursements will be reduced from the current annualized revenue run rate of $19.4 million to a stabilized level of approximately $15 million.<br>
The revenue impact from renewals and non-renewals will phase in during 2018 as detailed in the supplemental.<br>
Moving to our balance sheet, our low leverage joint venture free and flexible balance sheet, including significant cash on hand, remains a<br>differentiating and competitive advantage for us in any market environment.<br>

During the quarter, we considered market conditions and made a strategic decision to enter into an agreement to issue $450 million of senior<br>unsecured notes via a private placement.<br>
The notes consist of 3 series with 10-, 12- and 15-year tenures, all with coupons in the 4% to 4.5% range.<br>
The 10-year series was issued in December 2017 and the remaining 2 series will be funded in March 2018.<br>
We will use the net proceeds from these issuances to repay the 111 West 33rd Street and 1350 Broadway mortgage indebtedness before the<br>maturity dates in early April 2018, and to maintain cash balances.<br>
We believe that the ability to take care of opportunity for long-term value creation for shareholders outweighs the short-term cost.<br>
In January 2018, we increased the mortgage debt on 1333 Broadway from $66.6 million to $160 million due February 2033 with interest fixed at<br>4.21%.<br>
A portion of this increase was applied to release the $75.8 million mortgage lien on 1400 Broadway.<br>
These recent financing activities combined with the mortgage refinancing completed earlier in 2017 and our interest rate hedges will add<br>approximately $12 million or $0.04 per fully diluted share to our 2018 interest expense as compared with 2017.<br>
With the private placement and subsequent mortgage refinancing, we're very pleased to have accomplished several important objectives: first,<br>we've completely addressed our 2018 mortgage maturities. Our debt maturities are well laddered with only a single $250 million issue maturing<br>before 2022.<br>
We made a deliberate decision to go long, resulting in an extension of our weighted average maturities to 6.2 years as of year-end.<br>
With the closing of the 1333 Broadway refinance and the funding of the 12 and 15-year tranches of the private placement in March 2018, our<br>weighted average maturity will further increase to 8.9 years.<br>
Second, we reinforced and expanded our lender relationships with 4 leading life insurance companies.<br>
Lastly, we enhanced our cash balance with these financing transactions leaving us well positioned with liquidity and capacity for redevelopment<br>and external growth opportunities.<br>
As of December 31, 2017, the company has total debt outstanding of approximately $1.7 billion. The debt has a weighted average interest rate of<br>4.05%. None of our outstanding debt has variable rates.<br>
The company's consolidated net debt to total market capitalization was approximately 16.6% and consolidated net debt to EBITDA was 3.5x.<br>
We have the lowest leverage in the office suite sector and at quarter end hold cash and cash equivalents of $464.3 million.<br>
As we look ahead to 2018, let me provide some further perspective.<br>
As Tom mentioned, as part of our redevelopment program, we currently expect to vacate 700,000 square feet in 2018, which will reduce occupancy<br>during the year.<br>
In total, this space represents about $34.5 million of annual revenue and we expect roughly 2/3 of this space to be taken offline in the first half of<br>the year.<br>

Against this as detailed in the supplemental on Page 6, we had $17 million of signed leases not commenced of which we expect $800,000 to be<br>realized in 2018 revenue with an additional $10 million in 2019 and an additional $6 million in 2020.<br>
Further, we have $26 million of annualized free rent of which $13 million will be realized in 2018 with the majority of the balance in 2019.<br>
Consistent with what we have always said and what you have heard from the team today, the additional vacancy and the impact on revenue in<br>2018 is inherent in our strategic plan to deliver embedded derisk growth and shareholder value.<br>
With that, I would like to open the call for your questions. Operator?<br>
(technical difficulty)<br>
<b>Anthony E. Malkin</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Are we live? I want to apologize to everybody for our technical difficulties. We were blocked off of the call. This is Tony Malkin here.<br>
I'll take this opportunity to make a couple of comments if I may. First of all, aside from the conference call, I want to thank the team for the work<br>on the update that we've provided, sorry for the glitch. We just finished our fourth year as a public company. As I look back, I'm very happy with<br>what we have accomplished. We've done exactly what we have said we would do since inception. We have vacated and modernized the New York<br>portfolio for the 21st century, redeveloped our spaces and leased at outsized spreads to better tenants on longer lease terms at higher rents. We<br>are differentiated from our peers and our markets and in our segment. We have delivered outsized growth through our embedded, derisked<br>opportunities within our portfolio. And as the team has laid out, we have more to deliver over the next few years.<br>
Along the way, we have created a best-in-class balance sheet with ample liquidity and flexibility to take advantage of external growth when we<br>see something on which we want to act. We've also built our disclosure to investors and the analyst community and have a truly capable team<br>built around the culture of hard work, service and accountability. Our portfolio is solidly in its own category by combination of quality, price point<br>and locations. 2018 sets the stage for more of our internal growth story.<br>
We are going to vacate a lot of space, redevelop it and we believe the steady demand we see will allow us to execute as we have to date with<br>market and sector-leading leasing spreads.<br>
Looking forward, we are fully engaged and I personally am very excited with our position in growth prospects internally and our ability to take<br>advantage of external growth.<br>
Again, I apologize for the interruption. Maybe if we're lucky, we'll be able to get to questions now.<br>

I was just wondering if you guys can maybe talk about, obviously office REITs broadly have been beaten up pretty severely over the last month<br>and half or so and your stocks trading well below NAV, but I guess I was wondering given how many deals I know that you guys underwrite, have<br>you seen any movement on cap rates on the private side relative to how much public REIT cap rates have moved?<br>

<b>John B. Kessler</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
Rob, it's John Kessler. I think what we have seen in the capital market is certainly that transaction activity slow down. We saw that in -- certainly in<br>'17. I think as it relates to pricing and cap rates, we haven't really seen in the private market any kind of meaningful movement in pricing. And<br>obviously, we're cognizant where the treasury is and -- but that will be our response.<br>
<b>Robert Matthew Simone</b> - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Former Associate<br>
Sure, sure. And then on -- just on the cash balance. I came up with an estimated kind of like unrestricted, uncommitted cash balance of about $600<br>million, plus or minus after you guys completed refinancing. I guess could you maybe speak to what your view on timing is overall to kind of let<br>that sit on earning on your balance sheet. Just assuming that the environment doesn't change all that much and you guys kind of don't see that<br>bigger opportunity you've been waiting for?<br>
<b>John B. Kessler</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
Well it's the same question really about deploying the balance sheet. We have significant cash as you know and including our undrawn credit<br>facility and as we think about deploying it, we're going to continue to measure investment return on that capital versus the returns we're getting<br>on the redevelopment of our portfolio and as you know our cash NOI in our business grew by 7% in 2017 over the prior year. So we're still getting<br>very good growth. We still have about 1 million -- close to 1 million square feet to redevelop in the portfolio and we're going to continue to remain<br>patient and disciplined. If you see something in the external markets that is attractive relative to the internal return opportunities that we're getting<br>on our own portfolio, we're going to take action but we're going to continue to be patient.<br>
<b>Anthony E. Malkin</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Rob, Tony here. As I've said many times the old Yogi Berra-ism &quot;when we come to a fork in the road, we'll take it. &quot; And sometimes that fork is got<br>to be presented to you, sometimes it -- you stumble upon it. Sometimes you have to find it. So in short though, the cash we have on our balance<br>sheet, our primary objective with that the flexibility we have in our balance sheet, the low leverage we have on our balance sheet, the primary<br>objective is directed towards external growth. And our focus remains on growing the business, either through individual acquisitions or private<br>or public M&amp;A. And that's at least the sharp -- the bright shiny penny when we talk about external growth and when we talk about M&amp;A, so I think<br>John's comments are very focused on discipline as they should be. And it's certainly not our intention to look back in 10 years from now and to be<br>proud of the facts we have maintained our, over a 10 year period, our leverage at 17% net debt to enterprise value. That's not our goal.<br>

<b>John William Guinee</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD<br>
Great, great. Not sure who the right person to address this is but 700,000 square feet of renovation out of the 930,000 square feet of lease is expiring<br>in 2018. I assume it's a very low retention rate, one. And then two, how much money should -- is being budgeted per square foot for that 700,000?<br>Is this $200 a foot in base building TIs and releasing cost? Or is it, say, $300 a foot? And then could you also go through the remaining spend on<br>the Observatory? And then also the remaining spend on all of the retail repositioning?<br>

<b>Thomas P. Durels</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - EVP of Real Estate<br>
John, this is Tom. Out of the 700,000 square feet that we expect to vacate in 2018. As a reminder, the in-place fully escalated rent on that is about<br>$49 per square foot that represents an opportunity for significant mark-to-market. About 520,000 square feet is in our Manhattan office portfolio.<br>The balance is part of the retail redevelopment on 34th Street on Empire State Building and our greater New York metropolitan office portfolio.<br>So out of the 520,000 square feet that we are vacating in '18 in our Manhattan office portfolio, we'll redevelop about 300,000 square feet of that.<br>As to cost, as we've said before depending on whether we build space with a cap contribution following a white box or build a prebuild, those all<br>in cost including base building, which is a onetime expense, TI, whether it be a contribution or the build out of a prebuilt and leasing commission<br>can range between $180 to $210 per square foot, all in.<br>
<b>David A. Karp</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
And John, with your question on the remaining spend on the Observatory. To date, we spent $36 million on the Observatory capital projects and<br>as we have said in the past, we expect that project over the 3 year time horizon commencing in mid-2017 when we started the project through<br>the end to run a total of approximately $150 million.<br>
<b>John William Guinee</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD<br>
Okay. And then regarding the Observatory, I think you said that you're going to go down from $19.4 million in net total growth annualized rent<br>down to about $15 million run rate. Essentially, you've got $5 million of lease -- of annualized rent expiring at '18. Is this another way of saying that<br>expect all of the remaining $15 million to go away as these leases expire? Or from '19 on, can you expect to maintain a $15 million run rate indefinitely?<br>
<b>John B. Kessler</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
John, it's John Kessler. Just to clarify, I assume you meant the broadcast (inaudible)?<br>
<b>John William Guinee</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD<br>
Broadcast. I'm sorry, yes.<br>
<b>John B. Kessler</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
And the answer is that today, the trailing 12-month revenue is '19. We project as you can see in our supplement that with rollovers, we'll get to<br>approximately $15 million of annual run rate by the end of the year and what we're saying is that we believe that is a reasonable stabilized run rate<br>for that business going forward. In other words, that's where we end up at the $15 million rate.<br>
<b>John William Guinee</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD<br>
Okay. No more leakage with the $2 million of lease expirations in '20 or the 1.4 million square feet in '22? When you get this particularly done.<br>
<b>Thomas P. Durels</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - EVP of Real Estate<br>
John, it would be -- really we're pretty much done with all of our lease renewals. We have like 1 radio guy out there but I expect them to stay. And<br>there is going to be some offsets, there is some opportunities from modest improvement in income from point-to-point, some backup situations.<br>So as John said, we view this as stabilized at $15 million.<br>

<b>John William Guinee</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD<br>
And then the last question, which I know you won't answer but I'll ask anyhow. Is the $150 million of spent for the Observatory, is that expected<br>to generate increasing NOI or just more of a defensive spend and we expect that maybe the run rate on the Observatory stays about the same?<br>
<b>Anthony E. Malkin</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
John, Tony here. I certainly look at this as anything that we do, which is offensive inherently as defensive but this is absolutely in our view, offense.<br>That is our hope and intention.<br>
So when I say offense, I mean putting more points on the board.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.<br>
<b>James Colin Feldman</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director and Senior US Office and Industrial REIT Analyst<br>
I was hoping just to dig a little bit more into the visitor trends of the Observatory? I guess year-over-year, you did have fewer bad weather days but<br>total visitors were down. So just any insight you can provide on to what you're seeing? What types -- just kind of trends and what's driving volume?<br>And if -- we should expect to see a more subdued volume going forward?<br>
<b>Anthony E. Malkin</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Well, we do present certain materials in our presentation on the breakdown on the Observatory and we have made the comment before, which<br>is still consistent, Jamie that the biggest issue is the cross-border. And I'm not referring about tourists from Canada. The U.S. brand as a destination<br>for tourism is definitely damaged by the rhetoric out of DC. And that hurt us in 2017, it hurt the whole industry. I do think that it's best to take a<br>look at what the hotel association and other entities, which have more to say on this subject than we would undertake to go into on this call have<br>to say. But in the meantime, for us, there is a reduction in cross-border and -- we get a little tired I think in the end. We're putting the weather<br>information in the supplemental because to some degree, I feel like we're a retailer talking about coat sales, you know? And I don't want to overdo<br>it. In the end, we look at these things holistically, did we have worse weather in 2017 on specific dates? Yes, although there may have been fewer<br>bad weather days. Overall, we got specifically hit very hard with 0 visibility during peak periods in August where we had just terrible weather. But<br>in the end, the overall trend in 2017 was not positive for cross boarder visitors and that's the majority of our visitors to the Empire State Building.<br>
<b>James Colin Feldman</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director and Senior US Office and Industrial REIT Analyst<br>
Okay. Do you see any signs of this changing? Or anything year-to-date that's giving you a different view?<br>
<b>Anthony E. Malkin</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
I do know that there are a number of industry groups getting together and approaching the White House on this issue specifically. But from our<br>perspective, our job in the end is to get a higher percentage of people coming to New York City by giving them a better attraction, a better reason<br>to come. And in addition, to put more people through the door during off-peak periods, which is where we have a lot of capacity. And again, I think<br>with a better attraction, we'll have a better prospect of doing that. And of course, through all of that, we're looking to drive our per cap revenue.<br>

Okay. And then can you just talk about the Uber -- the Uber -- the lease that Uber's backfilling. What kind of impact that might have on '18 earnings?<br>And the timing for them to backfill?<br>
<b>Thomas P. Durels</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - EVP of Real Estate<br>
Well first, as I mentioned, Jamie that, that was involved a recapture of space from an existing tenant and we achieved about a 9% mark-to-market<br>increase on that over the prior fully escalated rent. The lease will commence this year and then they're going to a free rent period. Generally where<br>-- for the space that they took without going into specifics for confidentiality, I can say we're asking in the low 60s at 1400 Broadway, our ask price<br>all the way to the tower goes up to the high 60s per square foot.<br>
<b>James Colin Feldman</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director and Senior US Office and Industrial REIT Analyst<br>

<b>James Colin Feldman</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director and Senior US Office and Industrial REIT Analyst<br>

No. I prefer not for confidentiality.<br>
<b>Anthony E. Malkin</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Obviously it will be reported in our first quarter numbers along with whatever lease -- other lease cancellations we generate.<br>
<b>James Colin Feldman</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director and Senior US Office and Industrial REIT Analyst<br>
Okay. And the last question for me is -- and it's hard to tell just kind of on a same-store basis how much rents are growing? Or what leasing spreads<br>are? Given the amount of redevelopment spend in the portfolio. Can you just give us some color on what you think kind of apples to apples rent<br>improvements have been in the portfolio this year?<br>
<b>Thomas P. Durels</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - EVP of Real Estate<br>
Sure. First of all, the rent growth is a function of supply and demand and I feel good about the activity we have in our portfolio and we have strong<br>demand for our product, our locations and our price point. Where we like our position in the market because we're less expensive than Class A.<br>We've delivered better product than Class B. As we look back, we've outperformed the market in terms of rent growth based upon our redevelopment<br>work, particularly at Empire State Building, 111 West 33rd Street and 250 West 57th Street. Whereas we look back over the past 40 months or so,<br>we grew our rent anywhere from 19% to 47%, depending on spaces -- our asking rents in those buildings and the actual taking about 12% to 34%,<br>

we think that, that is a significant outperformance of the market. Overall, we see steady activity on our portfolio, the market feels healthy and given<br>that, I think we should see some modest improvement in rent growth in the coming year.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.<br>
<b>Craig Allen Mailman</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
David, appreciate the incremental color here on kind of the puts and takes for '18. I mean is it fair to say that kind of taking a step back, '18's sort<br>of a transition year for you guys, from an earnings perspective? And to really kind of mark maybe a near-term bottom that you can accelerate off<br>of? Is that how we should think about it?<br>
<b>David A. Karp</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
Craig, I'll just kind of point you back to Tony's comment that he made at the conclusion of our prepared remarks and that is we're looking at 2018<br>as an important year in the future growth and the completion of this first phase of our redevelopment process. There is -- as Tom has mentioned,<br>there is a lot of space coming offline and we've tried to quantify what that impact will be in terms of the lost revenue associated with the space<br>that goes down and is offset by the signed leases not commenced and the burn off of free rent that we have to backfill that. But I think we've also<br>indicated that our occupancy -- we do expect our occupancy to drop at the end of the year as compared to the beginning of the year. So it is a very<br>active year for us but it's nothing unusual and it's consistent with what we've been saying all along that our occupancy will go up and down and<br>that we'll be taking space offline, we'll be reinvesting with it all towards the end goal of substantially increasing our recurring revenues as well as<br>enhancing our total shareholder value.<br>
<b>Anthony E. Malkin</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Tony here. Just to add to that, it is central to our thesis from the moment of the conception of this company that we had a tremendous amount of<br>tenancy, which was the vast, vast, vast majority of it was undesirable small low-credit short-term leases and unable to pay better rents and many<br>of them unable to pay the rents that they were contracted to make payment. In order for us to redevelop the space, we must vacate the space.<br>That's a basic fact of life. And we view 2018 as an important year for our growth. I can understand how you might look at it from the perspective<br>of well, gee, it's increased vacancy. But for us, this is all upside. And that's the way in which we look at it. All upside.<br>
<b>Craig Allen Mailman</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
I know and I appreciate that and we all know that you're going to have dips and what not related to the redevelopment. I was just getting at, if you<br>guys are taking 700,000 square feet offline and about 1 million left to redevelop, it seems like most of the dip from taking that space offline was<br>kind of hit in the '18, maybe early '19 and then just trying to get a sense of, is that how you guys are viewing the business that this should be the<br>trough from that activity and...<br>
<b>Anthony E. Malkin</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Well do me a favor, maybe Tom could comment on some of the visibility that we have in our presentation with regard to spaces rolling in the<br>future.<br>

<A name=681></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, ESRT - Q4 2017 Empire State Realty Trust Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Thomas P. Durels</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - EVP of Real Estate<br>
Sure. I mean Craig, as I've gone through those numbers previously. We have the 930,000 square feet that's expiring in 2018. We have given the stat<br>on how much we expect to vacate in that year and then our role in the following years is rather modest. So we view 2018 as a big year of execution<br>for us. But with -- coming off the year at 1.3 million square feet of leasing, which is a record year for us in 2017 and going into the first quarter, we<br>have solid activity and absolute conviction in our strategy, we continue to build value as we execute on that strategy and I feel good about the<br>activity we have for our product and our locations and price point. So I feel good about taking this space back and executing on our strategy to<br>lease that up at higher rents for longer term.<br>
<b>David A. Karp</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO<br>
And Craig, this is David. Just 1 other point, again if you look at our investor presentation, we have a slide in there, which sets forth -- it doesn't set<br>forth what we're vacating but it does set forth what we expect to redevelop. And if you -- and this is on Page 16 I believe of the investor deck and<br>we show that in 2018, we've got a fair amount of redevelopment and you compare -- we're showing 225,000 square feet roughly as redevelopment<br>in 2018 and then we look out over subsequent years, 2019, that drops down to 90,000 and 2020 about 95,000. So again, 2018 very active year for<br>us in terms of vacate and redevelopment, which then feeds that growth for those subsequent years.<br>
<b>Craig Allen Mailman</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
That's helpful. Then just I know we've talked about the cash balances you guys have and you guys are being deliberate about deploying it. Just --<br>could you give us thoughts on not using some of that to pay down some of the mortgage debt in the near term and kind of lessen the earnings<br>dilution here from keeping on the balance sheet versus kind of putting to work with that prepayment?<br>
<b>John B. Kessler</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - President &amp; COO<br>
Craig, it's John. That question, I think, is similar to the others where we continue to take the view that it's valuable to have the liquidity and the low<br>leverage balance sheet that we have and we like to have the cash and liquidity on hand. I think -- we think there is a difference between liquidity<br>and the leverage and we're going to continue to be -- take the tact that you've seen us take, which is to preserve that liquidity so we can be nimble<br>if we see opportunity in the market.<br>
<b>Anthony E. Malkin</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Well, let's be very clear, we have to be nimble when we see opportunity. We know we're going to see opportunity. And we are designed for growth.<br>Not for just the same business being repeated year after year. That's our goal, that's our orientation, Craig.<br>
<b>Craig Allen Mailman</b> - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
And then just one last one. Taken the 102nd floor offline, is there going to be a similar disruption to the main deck at any point as you guys do the<br>$150 million of spend and also, was there any way to get around taking the full floor offline?<br>
<b>Anthony E. Malkin</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Well the 102nd floor is accessed by 1 elevator and that elevator needed to be replaced and it's not practical to have people walk from the 86th<br>floor to the 102nd floor. There will be points in time in which different parts of the Observatory, which you presently walk through are not available<br>due to construction. However, the 86th floor outside deck will remain open 100% throughout the entire construction period. And the reason the<br>102nd floor elevator is offline now is because between January 1 and Easter is our slowest period. So working with [Otis], we're getting that work<br>done so we're open before I peak periods resume. But at no point will the 86th floor Observatory deck be closed under our present plans.<br>

<A name=682></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, ESRT - Q4 2017 Empire State Realty Trust Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Our final question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.<br>
<b>John William Guinee</b> - Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD<br>
Tony, I've got 2 follow-up questions. First, no question with the big growth relocation is coming to Hudson Yards that there's going to be big<br>vacancies in the office world and also that there is going to be big dollars needed to take those tired buildings up to current standard and you guys<br>are obviously good at that but so are a lot of people. How does that get underwritten? What sort of stabilize yield on cost do you think is expected<br>for those kind of deals? That's 1 question. And then the second question is I think you were very public on the upcoming Armageddon in the retail<br>world and Street retail in Manhattan. Do you have any updates on that?<br>
<b>Anthony E. Malkin</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
Well, what I might do is as much as I'd like to talk about other people's return needs on redevelopment is to say just that from my own perspective,<br>we know we're making a 10% overall -- 10% to slightly higher when we reinvest in our own properties on a ROI basis, not an IRR basis. And that we<br>have seen capital markets deploy capital at what we think are much lower IRR's let alone ROIs. So I do think that with this redevelopment opportunity,<br>look, we've seen many landlords today not improve their buildings or may be put in a new lobby instead of doing anything fairly fundamental.<br>And lease frankly, to secondary tenants at lower rents and give away much higher concession packages. And we don't think that, that is a good<br>strategy. However, when you look at their balance sheets particularly some of the public ones, they're not in a position really to do more. That's<br>what they can afford to do. And I think that there are probably people in the private market who will be looking at that as well. It's difficult to pay<br>very high prices and then have money set aside to do meaningful upgrades to the buildings. End of story. So our hope is that we have higher<br>interest rates with people less able to plow on leverage, with the skills needed in order to do this kind of work that, that will all combine to our<br>benefit from a competitive perspective and also right down to our benefit from a potential yield perspective. I'm going to ask Tom Durels to make<br>a couple of comments on retail just from what we're seeing. Because I do believe that this Armageddon as it were -- I don't think it's coming. I think<br>a, we're in it. But I do think it's selective in nature. And I think it's worthwhile just to talk a little bit about what we see as far as better locations versus<br>non-good locations and what's happening in the market place with retail and then I'll have a comment or 2.<br>
<b>Thomas P. Durels</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - EVP of Real Estate<br>
Sure. I would say that there is no questions that while the retail market is slow and I think that what we've maintained is our retail, which is located<br>in high-traffic areas and in excellent submarkets is always going to be in demand. If I could take a step back and look what we've accomplished as<br>we set forth strategies to release our space -- our retail space at 57th Street, Times Square South, 34th Street and the Empire State Building, we set<br>with the strategy to redevelop all of our street front of 57th Street where we're 100% released 61,000 square feet to tenants like T.J. Maxx, HSBC,<br>AT&amp;T, Starbucks, most recently with the expansion of T.J. Maxx that 61,000 square feet is now on 4 floors fully leased. We've leased all of our<br>availabilities on Broadway. You look at the transformation of that submarket and the influx of interesting food and retailers, we leased all of our<br>space at 112 West 34th Street and all of our 33rd Street to interesting food users. So now we're focused on our 34th Street frontage at Empire State<br>Building. And I feel very good about the product that we have and retail is going to go where there is pedestrian street traffic and we have tremendous<br>street traffic obviously on 34th Street.<br>
<b>Anthony E. Malkin</b> - Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO<br>
In short, John, we know Sephora per square foot basis is one of their, if not, their top per square foot floor in North America -- store in North America.<br>Target is doing great. Foot Locker is doing great. So retail is not dead but there is too much retail in places, which don't matter and then there are<br>places where there are certain aspects of retail, which don't really matter at all anymore as the industry and that I think is really seen in SOHO, it's<br>in some of the tourist areas. It doesn't help for the -- for some of these super luxury locations that overseas travel into the U.S. is down. So overall,<br>I think it's not coming, it's here. You're seeing it. And prices are coming way, way, way down. But I think that speaks to demand.<br>

I thought John, you're going to ask something different, which I'd like to close, which is the -- along with thanks to everybody for participating in<br>today and sorry for the glitch. The most important piece of disclosure, which is the order it's been finished, alphabetically not by order of time for<br>the run-up, we have the biggest field ever of analysts participating in the Empire State Building run up and we like to thank Justin Devery, Blaine<br>Heck, Tim Hong, John Guinee, John Kim and Alex Nelson who took on this February's challenge. It was terrific. As an inducement, remember, John<br>Kessler and David Karp buy free beer for everybody who runs up and by the way you can collect those beers before you run or after you run. And<br>any investor who would like to participate, if you meet a certain minimum threshold of ownership of the stock, we can get you on board as well.<br>So sorry for the disruption. We felt it was a great quarter. We're very excited with 2018. Thanks for your time.<br>

<A name=686></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, PLNT - Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call<br>
system-wide same-store sales growth of 11.6% on top of a 10.6% comp gain in the same period last year and adjusted earnings per share of $0.24,<br>both of which exceeded expectations.<br>
For the full year, we added 1.7 million net new members and finished 2017 with approximately 10.6 million members system wide. At the same<br>time, we expanded our footprint domestically and internationally with the opening of a company record 210 Planet Fitness locations, bringing the<br>system-wide total store count to 1,518 at the end of December. With many retailers reducing their physical presence due to increasing pressure<br>from online shopping, real estate trends continue to be in our favor. Landlords and developers are looking to Planet Fitness more and more as key<br>tenants in their centers, giving us the luxury of being more selective with our site approvals.<br>
Of the 210 stores opened in 2017, 206 were franchise locations. These were in existing markets and new markets like Hawaii and Panama. With the<br>Hawaii store marking Planet Fitness' presence in all 50 states and the Panama location demonstrating our continued international expansion. We<br>are pleased with the number of new member sign-ups in both Panama and Hawaii and extremely encouraged by the demand for the brand.<br>
As important to note, more than 95% of new stores last year were opened by existing franchisees, demonstrating the attractive returns our units<br>generate in reinforcing their commitment to growing their individual businesses and the Planet Fitness brand. While franchise growth continues<br>to drive our expansion strategy, we took advantage of some attractive real estate opportunities and opened 4 new corporate locations late in the<br>year. And then in early 2018, we acquired 6 stores in eastern Long Island, New York from a long-standing Planet Fitness franchisee that decided to<br>retire after 11 years in the system. This acquisition made great strategic sense as the western half of the market is currently all corporate stores,<br>giving us the opportunity to leverage our existing infrastructure and drive growth and increase margins.<br>
Planet Fitness' long runway for growth and increasing brand awareness continues to reinforce my confidence for the future. Our marketing power<br>only continues to get stronger with each new join. Starting with our growing national advertising fund, we spent approximately $34 million last<br>year on national marketing campaigns and high-profile partnership opportunities like our sponsorship of Time Square's iconic New Year's Eve<br>celebration. And we estimate that approximately $100 million was spent locally by franchisees in 2017 to highlight our unique judgment-free<br>environment that caters to casual or first-time gym goers versus avid exercisers like stereotypical gyms.<br>
Underscoring the reach and effectiveness of our collective marketing efforts, I am pleased to report the findings of our annual brand health study<br>in January confirmed that brand and ad awareness levels are at their highest observed levels to date. Planet Fitness continues to rank #1 in aided<br>and unaided brand awareness in the gym category, both up 9 percentage points year-over-year since January 2017.<br>
In addition, findings showed that consideration for joining Planet Fitness is higher when people are aware of our Times Square and New Year's Eve<br>partnership, up 6 percentage points year-over-year. In addition, to being laser focused on attracting new members to our brand, we are working<br>hard on enhancing member experience by leveraging the data we have from our 10.6 million members, another huge competitive advantage for<br>us given our size, scale and resources.<br>
Looking out over the next few years, we are exploring new ways of delivering more personalized and connected fitness journey to our members<br>via our equipment and enhanced mobile app. Our vision is for our equipment to have the ability to provide immersive entertainment and workout<br>experiences. For example, as a Black Card member, you could have an elevated experience where you watch your Netflix, your Hulu, listen to your<br>Spotify, browse your Facebook or run through the Grand Canyon. Once you choose what appeals to you, you get work running on the treadmill,<br>and your progress is tracked and sent to the Planet Fitness app. As you leave the gym that day, you see how far you ran, how many calories you've<br>burned and how that compares to last week, last month or last year.<br>
Perhaps the most exciting opportunity here isn't what I just described but rather, having the ability to develop personalized recommendations on<br>what workout to do during your next visit based on your history and progress. By leveraging our data, we could target White Card members and<br>serve them trial opportunities with a goal of getting them to upgrade. And the equipment technology could allow them to easily upgrade to the<br>Black Card right on the machine itself, so they can have an instant access to the enhanced user experience of watching their favorite programs or<br>running through exotic locations. I'm energized and excited about collaborating with our equipment vendors and franchisees to leverage our size,<br>scale and data to enhance our members' experience in the years to come. We are currently in dialogue with 3 of our equipment manufacturers<br>about our next equipment contract, and we look forward to sharing more details about the next generation of machines we'll feature.<br>

<A name=687></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, PLNT - Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call<br>
Looking back in 2017. It was extremely successful year on every front. Financially, we posted double-digit system-wide same-store sales growth<br>for the year and achieved record adjusted EBITDA. Strategically, we expanded our brand reach and awareness through the opening of a record<br>210 new locations and approximately 130 million in national and local advertising. And operationally, we added some great new talent to our<br>executive team and bolstered our franchisee support teams to help further improve execution throughout the system.<br>
We began 2018 with great momentum, and I'm confident that Planet Fitness is poised to deliver increased shareholder value over the long term<br>and simultaneously continue to improve millions of people's lives each and every day. And underscoring their confidence in our future, the Board<br>of Directors recently authorized an increase in our share repurchase program to $100 million.<br>
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dorvin.<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing the details of our fourth quarter results, highlights from 2017 and then discuss<br>our full year 2018 outlook.<br>
For the fourth quarter of 2017, total revenue increased 15.1% to $134 million from $116.4 million in the prior year period. Total system-wide<br>same-store sales increased 11.6%. From a segment perspective, franchisee same-store sales increased 11.9%, and our corporate store same-store<br>sales increased 5.6%. Over 90% of our Q4 comp increase was driven by net member growth with the balance being rate growth. The increase in<br>pricing was driven by 90 basis points increase in our Black Card penetration to 59.8% compared with last year, combined with a $2 increase in Black<br>Card pricing for new joins that we've put in place system wide on October 1. During the quarter, the increased Black Card pricing drove approximately<br>60 basis points of the increased same-store sales.<br>
Our Franchise segment revenue was $40 million, an increase of 24.6% from $32.1 million in the prior year period. Let me break down the drivers<br>of our fastest growing revenue segment. Royalty revenue was $27.1 million, which consists of royalties on monthly membership dues and annual<br>membership fees. This compares to royalty revenue of $17.5 million in the same quarter of last year, an increase of 54.8%. This year-over-year<br>increase had 3 drivers: First, we opened 206 new franchise stores since the fourth quarter of last year; Second, as I mentioned, our franchisee-owned<br>same-store sales increased by 11.9%; and then third, a higher overall average royalty rate.<br>
For the fourth quarter, the average royalty rate was 4.83%, up from 3.69% in the same period last year, driven by more stores at our current royalty<br>rate, including stores that amended their franchise agreements. As we discussed on our last call, as of the end of Q3, approximately 400 stores had<br>amended their existing franchise agreements to increase their existing royalty rate by an additional 1.59% and at the same time, eliminate the<br>commissions they paid to us on certain operational purchases, thereby reducing those operating expenses.<br>
During Q4, approximately 500 additional stores amended their existing franchise agreements, which will further accelerate the increase in our<br>average royalty rate for 2018. However, it is important to remember that the increased royalty revenue that we'll receive due to the additional<br>1.59% royalty rate change is being offset by a corresponding decline in commission income as we will no longer receive commission income on<br>operational expense purchases by these stores. I'll discuss our assumptions for future royalty rate growth later on in the call when I outline our<br>2018 guidance.<br>
Next, our franchise and other fees were $6.4 million, an increase of 2.5% or $100,000 over the prior year period. These fees are received from<br>processing dues to our point-of-sale system, fees from online new member sign-ups as well as fees paid to us in association with new franchise<br>agreements, area development agreements as well as the sale and transfer of existing agreements. As many of you are aware, there are new GAAP<br>rules on revenue recognition for contracts with customers, which would apply to our area development agreements and franchise agreements<br>that went into effect January 1, 2018. In essence, we now need to recognize these fees related to both area development agreements and franchise<br>agreements over the life of the related franchise agreement, typically, 10 years, versus recognizing it all at once at the time a lease is signed for a<br>franchise store location. This not only applies to all future ADAs and FAs but also certain existing agreements entered into post TSG's acquisition<br>of Planet Fitness in 2012. Under the accounting rules, you cannot go back prior to our acquisition to reestablish a deferred revenue component<br>prior to that date.

Back to our Q4 results. Also within franchise segment revenue is our placement revenue, which was $4 million versus $3.6 million in the prior year<br>period, an increase of 11.3%. These are fees we received for placement and assembly of equipment for our franchise-owned stores. The increase<br>was driven primarily by higher new store equipment sales during the current year quarter.<br>
Finally, our commission income, which are commissions from third-party preferred vendor arrangements and equipment commissions for<br>international new store openings, was $2.5 million compared with $4.8 million a year ago. The decrease is attributable to the number of stores that<br>have amended their existing franchise agreements and increased their royalty rate instead of paying higher cost of goods per operational expenses<br>that I mentioned a few moments ago.<br>
Our corporate-owned stores segment revenue increased 8.7% to $28.2 million from $26 million in the prior year period. The $2.2 million increase<br>was driven by the increase in corporate-owned same-store sales at 5.6% and increased annual fee revenue.<br>
Turning to our equipment segment. Revenue increased by $7.5 million or 12.8% to $65.8 million from $58.3 million. The increase was driven by<br>higher new store equipment placements versus a year ago and higher replacement equipment sales to existing franchisee-owned stores.<br>
For 2017, replacement revenue, as a percent of total equipment revenue, was approximately 38% versus 31% for the prior year. Our cost of revenue,<br>which primarily relates to direct cost of equipment sales to new and existing franchisee-owned stores, amounted to $50.9 million compared to<br>$45 million a year ago, an increase of 13.2%, which was driven by an increase in equipment sales during the quarter. Store operation expenses,<br>which are associated with our corporate-owned stores, increased to $15.3 million compared to $14.4 million a year ago. The increase was primarily<br>driven by costs associated with the opening of 4 new stores in the quarter, including preopening expenses. Excluding these new store preopening<br>expenses, adjusted store operation expenses would have increased slightly to $14.7 million from $14.4 million. We did not open any new stores<br>in the prior year period.<br>
SG&amp;A for the quarter was $17.7 million compared to $13.5 million a year ago. This increase was primarily related to higher variable compensation<br>and equity compensation as compared to the prior year. This was also the primary driver of the increase in SG&amp;A compared to the third quarter of<br>2017. In addition, on a year-over-year basis, we had some incremental payroll to support our growing operations and infrastructure as well as some<br>non-cash expenses related to the write-off of some capitalized IT cost.<br>
Our operating income increased $17.2 million to $42.3 million for the quarter compared to operating income of $36.1 million in the prior year<br>period. While operating margins increased approximately 60 basis points to 31.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to the revenue growth<br>and higher margins as we've continued to leverage our overall cost infrastructure. As a result of the new tax reform act, we were required to make<br>some adjustments to deferred tax assets and our TRA liability as of year-end, and those adjustments had to be run through our income statement<br>and affected both our net income before taxes and our GAAP tax rates.<br>
Our GAAP effective income tax rate for the quarter was 99.8% compared to 24.6% in the prior year period. Our 2017 results include an additional<br>income tax expense of approximately $349.6 million, primarily due to the tax reform act as a result of a revaluation of our deferred tax assets to<br>reflect the new lower corporate tax rate, partially offset by $315.6 million gain from the revaluation of our TRA liability, which is included in other<br>income and expenses.<br>
As a result of this, we reported a net loss attributable to Planet Fitness, Inc. of $3.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share on a GAAP basis for the quarter<br>of 2017 compared to net income attributable to Planet Fitness, Inc. of $10.6 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the prior year fourth quarter. Net<br>income was $0.8 million compared to $21.9 million a year ago. As we've stated before, because of the income attributable to the non-controlling<br>interest and not taxed at the Planet Fitness, Inc. corporate level, an appropriate adjusted income tax rate for 2017 would be approximately 39.5%<br>if all the earnings of the company were taxed at the Planet Fitness, Inc. level.<br>
On an adjusted basis, net income was $23.5 million or $0.24 per diluted share, an increase of 19.1% compared to $19.7 million or $0.20 per diluted<br>share in the prior year period. Adjusted net income has been adjusted to exclude non-recurring expenses, the impact from the tax reform adjustments<br>of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, the associated TRA liabilities and reflect a normalized tax rate of 39.5%. We have provided a reconciliation<br>of adjusted net income to GAAP net income in today's earnings release.<br>

<A name=689></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, PLNT - Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call<br>
With the passage of tax reform late last year, we now expect our normalized tax rate, which includes federal, state and local taxes, to be approximately<br>25% to 26% for 2018. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for the impact<br>of certain noncash and other items that are not considered in the evaluation of ongoing operating performance, increased 16% to $51.2 million<br>from $44.1 million in the prior year period. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income can also be found in the earnings release.<br>
By segment, our franchise segment EBITDA increased 23.4% to $32 million, driven by higher royalties received from additional franchisee-owned<br>stores not included in the same-store sales base and an increase in franchise-owned same-store sales of 11.9%. Our franchise segment adjusted<br>EBITDA margins increased by approximately 20 basis points to 81.1%.<br>
Corporate-owned store segment EBITDA increased 6.5% to $11.3 million, primarily driven by a 5.6% increase in corporate same-store sales and<br>higher annual fees, partially offset by preopening expenses associated with the 4 corporate-owned stores that opened up during the quarter. Our<br>corporate stores segment adjusted EBITDA margins increased by approximately 110 basis points to 42.6%.<br>
Our equipment segment EBITDA was essentially flat year-over-year at $15 million. However, adjusted EBITDA increased by $1.6 million year-over-year<br>and adjusted EBITDA margins were 22.7% as compared to 22.9% in the prior year quarter.<br>
Turning to the full year. Let me quickly summarize the highlights for 2017. Revenue increased 13.7%. System-wide same-store sales were up 10.2%,<br>and this marks the 11th straight year with positive same-store sales. Our fastest growing franchise segment grew revenue by 28.9%. Our average<br>royalty rate for the year increased 59 basis points to 4.25%. Corporate stores segment revenue rose $7.4 million driven by a 4.9% comp gain.<br>Equipment segment revenue increased 6.8%, which included 193 new store equipment sales. This was towards the lower end of our range of 190<br>to 200 due to a few franchisees that were unable to complete the construction on a couple locations in time for us to place the equipment prior<br>to year-end. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 22.7% to $184.7 million with margins up 315 basis points to 43%. And then lastly, our adjusted net<br>income was up 21.8%.<br>
Now turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $113.1 million and borrowing capacity under<br>our revolving credit facility stood at $75 million. Total bank debt, excluding deferred financing cost, was $709.5 million at year-end, consisting<br>solely of our senior term loan. As you're aware from the press release we issued on January 2, 2018, we utilized approximately $29 million of our<br>year ending cash to complete the 6-store acquisition from our franchisee stores located in Long Island that Chris mentioned earlier.<br>
As we announced today, the Board of Directors has authorized an increase in our share repurchase program to $100 million. Future share purchases<br>could be funded by a portion of our current cash position, future cash flows or borrowings under our credit facility.<br>
With respect to CapEx, our total spend in 2017 was $37.7 million, which included approximately $6 million for our new corporate offices. Additionally,<br>we incurred approximately $8 million for 4 new corporate stores as well as $7 million for replacement equipment for our corporate store base. The<br>remaining CapEx was primarily associated with store renovations and IT projects. For 2018, we anticipate CapEx to be approximately $30 million<br>on an apples-to-apples basis with a target of 4 to 5 new corporate stores. We will incur CapEx for replacement equipment similar to the prior year.<br>
Now onto our outlook. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we currently expect revenue to increase approximately 20%. However, included in<br>this guidance is the impact of additional revenue from the 2% of monthly dues we collect from all of our franchisees for the national ad fund,<br>including our corporate stores and as required by the new GAAP rules beginning January 1 of this year. Prior to 2018, the NAF contributions really<br>only had an impact on our balance sheet as restricted cash or as liability. Due to the recent accounting changes, we must now recognize these<br>contributions as revenue and book the expenses associated with managing the national ad fund as marketing expenses in our SG&amp;A line. While<br>we expect there will be no impact quarterly or for the full year to our bottom line from this change, it is contributing approximately 8% to 10% to<br>our 2018 top line growth rate.<br>
Also incorporated in our top line outlook is the impact from the change in how we recognize ADA and FA fee revenue, which will be about a $4<br>million headwind this year compared with 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we now need to recognize these fees over a 10-year period versus the time<br>the related store and lease is signed. For example, in 2017, we typically recognized $30,000 for each new store location, $10,000 for the ADA and<br>$20,000 for the FA when the store lease is signed. In 2018, under the new rules, for each ADA and FA that we sell, we'll recognize $3,000 for the<br>

first year of the agreement for each franchise store opening and the remaining $27,000 in equal installments over the next 9 years. Helping to<br>partially offset this headwind is the fact that we need to re-recognize the remaining portion of ADA and FA fees associated with existing agreements<br>signed since 2012, which were reestablished on our balance sheet as deferred revenue. We recognized approximately $6.8 million for these related<br>fees in 2017 under the prior old GAAP rules. If we had been under the current 2018 GAAP rules, we would have recognized $1.2 million. In 2018,<br>under current GAAP, we anticipate to recognize approximately $2.3 million, but as I stated earlier, approximately $4 million less than reported in<br>2017, which under previous GAAP, would have dropped to the bottom line of our P&amp;L.<br>
In terms of profitability, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth to increase in the mid-teens percentage range. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS<br>is projected to increase by approximately 40%. This guidance assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 25% to 26%, which includes the new<br>federal, state and local rate following the recent tax reform. As a comparison to the prior year and before the tax reform act rate reductions, adjusted<br>net income and adjusted EPS would have grown by approximately 20%.<br>
We plan to reinvest a portion of our tax savings back into the business in 2018, primarily in infrastructure and technology for our stores and systems<br>to ensure Planet Fitness is well positioned to capitalize on the current industry trends in order to benefit our business and enhance the member<br>experience. These investments, which are estimated to be in the $7 million to $8 million range, are in addition to the CapEx spend already outlined.<br>
The following are the assumptions used in developing our full year guidance. First, with respect to sales, system-wide same-store sales are expected<br>to increase in the high single-digit percentage range. We were also expecting to sell and place equipment in approximately 190 to 200 new stores,<br>again, this year and anticipate replacement equipment sales to be approximately 40% of total equipment sales. Also, I want to point out that our<br>EPS guidance doesn't include any potential future share repurchases.<br>
Finally, based on the approximately 900 stores that have amended their existing franchise agreements and increased their royalty rate by 1.59%<br>as of December 31, 2017, coupled with the new stores opening up at the current rate, we expect the average royalty rate to increase approximately<br>125 basis points in 2018. The majority of this increase being the estimated impact of stores amending their franchise agreements with a corresponding<br>decrease in commission income.<br>
I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions.<br>
<b>Q U E S T I O N S   A N D   A N S W E R S</b><br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.<br>
<b>Oliver Chen</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
We had a question, generally, on the unit economics of the new gyms. As you're building in more markets and you've had really impressive unit<br>growth, how are the unit economics trending? And then as we look ahead with the national marketing budget, it's been a real powerful part of<br>your story. How would you expect that dollar amount to trend on a long-term basis as it's quite an important part of what's been driving a lot of<br>the awareness? Just curious about how we should model that.<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
Sure, Oliver. In terms of new stores, the way we look at our new stores, we look at them by class year. We look at them in the months they open.<br>And as you see from our same-store sales we've talked about in the past that new stores tend to drive a fairly high percentage of the comps. The<br>first year in comp, kind of year 2 in operation, they're going to comp at, call it, 40% to 50%. Your second year is going to be in kind of that 20%,<br>25% range. And then once you get into the fourth year and older, they tend to be in the kind of the mid-single-digit range. Those are still very<br>

similar in terms of stores that we opened in 2017 from an EFT perspective, from a same-store sales perspective, very similar to our previous vintage<br>years.<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
I think -- Oliver, this is Chris. I think as far as the marketing standpoint, New Year's Eve again kicked it off. This is our third year, we auto renew for<br>an additional 2 years to that contract. So that's already done. Unaided brand awareness, as I mentioned, aided is the all-time high. We had dethroned<br>Gold's Gym the first year we did that, so ever since then, we've been #1, which I think is, again, continuing to drive these comps. What we're seeing<br>is that this marketing budget isn't static. It continues to grow with each new member. So 1.7 million members added net new last year is all<br>incremental marketing dollars that continues to fund this year. So I think is what we've seen is that momentum we're driving and a lot of the<br>data-driven decisions that we're using to formulate our marketing continue to drive those comps.<br>
<b>Oliver Chen</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Okay. And lastly, Chris, the digital innovation is really impressive, and it sounds exciting. How do you expect a lot of the changes there to impact<br>how we should think about the model? Do you think it will continue to increase traffic, increase customer satisfaction or decrease churn? What are<br>your thoughts on where digital will play into the -- for the customer experience and numbers?<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. You're talking about the premium consoles and the cardio that we're testing, right?<br>
<b>Oliver Chen</b> - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Equity Research Analyst<br>
Yes.<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. The -- again, it's -- first of all say it's still really early. We just put them in fourth quarter, 15 sites, 5 of each of the 3 manufacturer sites. One,<br>unfortunately, is yet to be put in, which will be shortly here. There's a delay in construction. It's still early, so we're cautious with that. But what I will<br>say and that being said is the early read on the early data is they are driving more White Card upgrades than their peers, peer clubs and driving a<br>little more usage than their peer clubs. So -- and evidently, people like running through New Zealand. So it's interesting to be able to -- I mean,<br>we're doing this for 25 years, Oliver, honestly and to be able to now actually know the habits of our members and to be able to see an increase in<br>handful of experiences based on the -- what we've learn is just something that this industry has never seen, and we're in the forefront of figuring<br>that out.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.<br>
<b>John Edward Heinbockel</b> - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Analyst<br>
So let me start with the $7 million to $8 million, right, that you're going to reinvest in the business. Can you go into that in a little more detail?<br>Where is that going? And I guess, it looks like were it not for that, EBITDA growth would be close to 20%. Is that about right?<br>

<A name=692></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, PLNT - Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. So the -- when it comes to the premium consoles and all the technology side, it really comes down to that complete ecosystem, which I talked<br>about in the past that we never had, neither did the industry. And I think when we work with these manufacturers of the equipment, which we're<br>in the process of is how do we enhance the member's experience, tee that data up back to the member so that they know what they did and how<br>to then, with algorithms, figure out what they should do tomorrow. When you think about all the wearables and apps out there, a lot of them track.<br>Not many recommend, and that's really the missing link, is what people need to do tomorrow to get their fitness journey started and to get results.<br>So -- and then capturing that data, how do we use that with insurance companies and corporations to show that their employees or subscribers<br>are getting healthier and working out and then how do we use that for advertising purposes for other businesses that say we have these members,<br>10 million members doing over 300 million workouts a year and how do we get them, what they're doing, what they like, what they not like, what<br>their experiences are and how do we get the right products in front of them based on their likes and dislikes for advertising purposes. So it's that<br>whole technology ecosystem, John, that we're looking at building to capture all that and then leverage our 10 million members and growing.<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. And John, I think your question was in terms of our guidance, I think I said we expected our adjusted EBITDA to grow in the mid-teens as a<br>percentage basis year-over-year.<br>
<b>John Edward Heinbockel</b> - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Analyst<br>
Right. And that -- but that includes the $7 million to $8 million investment, right?<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. The $7 million to $8 million is going to be mostly CapEx. There's going to be a little bit of it that's going to be OpEx. But a good chunk of it will<br>be CapEx.<br>
<b>John Edward Heinbockel</b> - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Analyst<br>
All right. And then secondly, if you think about your pace of openings, is there still the idea here that you want to hold to that 200 or so because<br>of what's happening on the real estate market? And is there any -- do you have any pushbacks from franchisees who want to grow faster, right,<br>given the performance of their boxes and the brand awareness that's building, right? You would think you could go faster and pick up more share.<br>Does the tension exist there or not really?<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
No, there's really no tension. And in fact, I mean, there's a number of franchisees that are ahead of their development schedule, and we'll keep<br>building in terms of site availability. I guess, I'd go back and maybe address it a little bit as we've talked about in the past and I think you alluded<br>to is that we still see significant favorability for us on the real estate site availability front. I mean, just the latest is Toys&quot;R&quot;Us and others that are out<br>there. And we don't see that doing anything but to continue to benefit us. And given that there's not a lot of retailers, particularly with the big<br>REITs that are spread out geographically, there's not a lot of other retailers that are taking down, call it, a couple hundred sites. So to me, the way<br>we look at it is that -- I mean, we're not holding them back, and we do have sites that we will not approve for a couple reasons. One, we think that<br>maybe the market is not developed to an extent that it's ready for that additional club that's going to be pulling members to that club; or second,<br>we're -- we don't think the sites kind of Main and Main, and we want to be at Main and Main. And we believe and we're certainly seeing it that if<br>you just hold on a little bit, some of those sites will become available. And then the third element, I would say, is that more and more franchisees<br>are doing ground-ups, and that's about an 18-month comp lag. And I mean, we have franchisees right now today that are out there doing ground-ups,<br>and a couple of them are in the process right now. That won't open until probably early in '19 as an example. But we believe that 200 a year is,<br>

we've called it, kind of labeled it thoughtful growth. We still think that's kind of the right number. But if we have franchisees that are bringing in<br>more sites in 2018 than they did in '17 and they're available sites that we think they should open, then we will approve them. But we really go at<br>it from that angle. The last point I will make is we've had now more and more what I'd call top-down approach to whether it's Chris or myself or<br>Rob Sopkin, our Chief Development Officer, of meeting directly with REITs and then taking sites in their portfolio, one, that's either available now<br>or, two, that's coming up on lease expiration with the existing tenant in the next like 24 to 36 months. And we're starting to push those sites now<br>down to the franchisees. We didn't do that 12, 18 months ago, and we're doing much more of that today.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
The next question comes from Jonathan Komp with Baird.<br>
<b>Jonathan Robert Komp</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst<br>
Chris, I want to follow up on a statement you made in the press release about carrying over significant brand momentum into 2018 and just wanted<br>to ask a broader question, what you've seen so far in the key sign-up periods. And then I think the high single-digit comps guidance for the year<br>is a little above what you had guided to initially for last year. So could you just talk about the sustainability of what you're currently seeing?<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. I think the momentum, everything from our comps still high single to low double-digit comps here for the first quarter, development pipeline,<br>sites [in those] locations, everything is the -- is filling up nicely for the year. So I see the momentum could carry on for sure as you've seen last couple<br>of years. Dorvin would add.<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. And Jon, the only thing I'd add to that is we guided full year. Obviously, we're not talking about the quarter here, but we guided full year in<br>that high single-digit range. We think Q1 will be clearly on the high end of that. Maybe low, low double digit, but we have that much visibility into<br>Q1. But we still feel comfortable with that kind of high single digit for the year.<br>
<b>Jonathan Robert Komp</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst<br>
Okay, great. And then in terms of some of the drivers, I know you talked a lot about some of the technology and the digital component or the app<br>component. Is there potential for loyalty to be included in that? I know it's something you talked about a little bit over the past year or so. But any<br>updates there?<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
Not heavily. But no doubt with the app and the technology and be able to host what people are doing, you can see how we could easily tie<br>achievements to some sort of rewards program or partnerships with other brands, the companies that we have partnered with or bundling. So<br>that would be a case, too. So that's why we spend $7.8 million. And then I think one thing with that technology we think about is it is a -- it's not<br>something that's one and done. It's an ever -- it's an evolution, and it will be as we learn and fine-tune over the years ahead of how we use it and<br>how we enhance member's experience. I think what it looks like in 6, 12 months will be very different than what it will look like at 36 months.<br>

I think, Jon, just to add onto that is that with Craig Miller, our Chief Digital and Information Officer, one of the things we're doing is we're building<br>that plumbing, that infrastructure to be able to do a lot more things from a technology perspective as Chris has been talking about even prior to<br>this call. But certainly today, to have the ability to pretty easily then link our systems in to some partnership with somebody on a loyalty program<br>as an example, whereas, today, it would take us months, if not, years to be able to build something like that. We will have the flexibility down the<br>road, to Chris' point, whatever the technology is and whatever it's evolved to, to be able to have the flexibility to do that with our existing systems<br>and partner up with others whatever that case may be.<br>
<b>Jonathan Robert Komp</b> - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst<br>
Okay, great. And then last one for me. I don't think this was covered. But when you think about the new equipment technology you're talking<br>about, obviously, I think that would be incorporated into new equipment sales. But would there also be potential to sell the console as a standalone<br>that could be retrofitted to existing equipment? So is that an incremental opportunity outside of the normal replenishment or reequipment cycle?<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
Not necessarily, no. But the newer cardio that's going in today is retrofittable with these consoles. So a franchisee, if they buy equipment today<br>and wants to retrofit the new stuff, they're not going to hold out buying stuff because they're waiting for the console, so they can retrofit them,<br>which is the good stuff -- good thing but would -- did have to upgrade. But I would see it could push -- if the trends continue and the data continues<br>to be positive as we see today even though it's early, I would see that, as a franchisee, you may not wait the full 5 years on cardio.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.<br>
<b>John William Ivankoe</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Restaurant Analyst<br>
The first, a housekeeping question and then a different one. Is there any change to the average equipment package sold per placement in '18 in<br>your estimates?<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
I'm sorry, John. Say that again. Any change in what?<br>
<b>John William Ivankoe</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Restaurant Analyst<br>
I apologize. Is there any change in the average price per equipment package sold per placement in '18 or...<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
No, no.<br>
<b>John William Ivankoe</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Restaurant Analyst<br>
Okay, so the same level as '17, All right. Great.<br>

<A name=695></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, PLNT - Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
Yes.<br>
<b>John William Ivankoe</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Restaurant Analyst<br>
And then secondly, are there any characteristics, defining characteristics that you see in the system, whether in terms of higher-than-average<br>volumes or higher-than-average profitability that you're seeing for your new stores, whether that's regional, whether it's urban, suburban, rural,<br>freestanding, what have you? I mean, are you really beginning to see a certain type of store really rise to the top maybe in '16 and '17? And is the<br>company doing with its franchisees anything to particularly pursue those types of sites in '18 and '19? So in other words, what I'm getting to is, is<br>there an opportunity to significant change the trajectory of new unit opening volumes.<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. I would say there's always outliers, John, a little bit. I mean, the extremes could be, say, a high urban area, is an example, corporate store in<br>Oakland, California over indexes in members and monthly EFT and certainly, EBITDA to more rural markets or markets outside of a metropolitan<br>area that might decile down a bit. We built a few more smaller stores in the last 12 months than we did the previous 12 months. And when I say<br>smaller, smaller on a square footage basis, not significantly but a little bit smaller. Sometimes that's because the only space you can get and<br>sometimes it's because it's a little bit of a smaller market. But in terms of -- the way I look at it, John, is how our franchisees' portfolio doing, knowing<br>they're not going to hit a grand slam on every single one and knowing they might, to a certain extent, maybe do what we kind of call a fill-in to<br>get a store into a market where you can -- you want to get one in there, maybe get it before the competition might get there. But it might be a<br>smaller store. And it might be one that you might not even expect to be up to your kind of average. But from talking to our franchisees, looking at<br>our corporate store portfolio, we opened 4 stores in Q4 last year, there's no major outliers out there. And with our Black Card percentage being<br>slightly higher with the $2 price point being higher, albeit it just started October 1 with new member sign-ups on the Black Card perspective, we<br>continue to see very good profitabilities at the four-wall basis.<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
I think the only I'd add, John, is the -- we have seen, the past 12 months, a slight uptick in better attrition, which has been promising.<br>
<b>John William Ivankoe</b> - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Restaurant Analyst<br>
Okay, that's great. And certainly, a lot of systems that I covered, you have some different economic performance across geographies. I mean, it's a<br>lot of different reasons that markets can perform materially different from, if not, an average unit volume perspective but from a profitability<br>perspective. Have you seen any real surprises, whether on the high side or on the low side that you're seeing as you're really -- you're kind of<br>continuing this fully national expansion?<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
John, there really isn't any -- I mean, there are -- there -- the ends of the spectrum could be a higher urban area with higher rent that, for some<br>reason, might not draw the higher volume to offset it. Many do. But whether you're in a Dallas, Chicago or Orlando, a Phoenix, a Denver, you go<br>across these different geographies where you might say the ethnicities in the market might be different. You might say the income levels might<br>be different. The weather might be -- you can go through all those, and John, we really don't see that. Now as I said earlier, there's always outliers<br>that might perform a bit different but not in the kinds of percentages that ever worry us whatsoever. So what we see is that you will have some<br>more rural markets or smaller population markets. But then they typically have very low rents. And so you might have 10%, 15% less in members<br>but you may be paying, instead of high teens or $20 square foot rent all in, you may be paying $5, $6 or $7. And so there are some of those markets<br>

that actually generate a higher EBITDA in dollar wise than a store in another market that have more members and more EFT. So it's not like what<br>you're referring to, to where you kind of see where a particular portfolio operates differently in the South East or the West or something. Our model<br>is -- doesn't -- and that's the beauty of the model. It doesn't work that way.<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
I mean, like real time, I'd say, John, is Hawaii, for example, is off to a bang-up start. Our club's the first one there, is killing it, so...<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
And we opened up a corporate store in Berlin, Vermont. And it's a very, very small town, rural area that, frankly, people in places like this, they're<br>used to driving 30 to 45 minutes to go to a grocery store or to a dentist. And so it pulls -- the club pulls from that kind of a range, and that club is<br>exceptionally well.<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. That's a -- inside enclosed mall, actually where the Walmart...<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
The next question comes from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.<br>
<b>Rafe Jason Jadrosich</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
You finished the year at the low end of your historical leverage range. Can you talk about how you're thinking about a potential debt recap for --<br>in 2018?<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
Sure. Yes, Rafe, we talked about this, I think, in Q4 when we did our Q3, when we did that release, and we've -- as you guys know, we've stated that<br>our kind of a range has always been kind of that 3 to 5 range. We are at the low end -- or getting towards the low end of that range. By the end of<br>this year, we would certainly be down at the low end or not below that. And we have had and are having conversations with our board about what<br>the right refinancing option should be and that's -- we said before that's something we would do sometime early in 2018, and we still expect to<br>do so.<br>
<b>Rafe Jason Jadrosich</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
Okay. And then when you look at the comp acceleration, are you seeing that in newer clubs ramping faster? Or is it in mature clubs that are seeing<br>the uptick? And what do you think is driving -- what's driving that, that's different now than it was maybe earlier this year? And kind of same question<br>for your corporate clubs. Are you seeing the comps accelerate and those are all mature? What's the change that you are seeing?<br>

<A name=697></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 9:30PM, PLNT - Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
It's pretty much across the board whether it's mature clubs, all-age clubs. You have remodels in there, and you have reequips in there and a lot<br>more stores doing that. A lot of it, too -- not a lot, but quite a bit is driven, too, by the annual fee timing is driving some as well as the secondary<br>billing option is driving some, which is a back-up billing method for the members.<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
I think the one thing which we've said in the past a bit is that -- and I think some of this has to do with clubs expanding, putting in older clubs,<br>expanding, putting a black card area or maybe clubs that came up on lease expiration that relocated across the street or down to the next shopping<br>center, things like that. I think our operators are much better today than they've ever been, and I think that as they've gotten larger, they have<br>gotten more sophisticated with their operations team and their marketing teams and real estate. I mean, you go back 4, 5 years ago, Rafe, we didn't<br>have hardly any of our franchisees that had a -- head of real estate, a CMO, a CFO and frankly, probably an operator outside of the franchisee. Today,<br>many of our larger groups have that talent, and I think they're just dialing it in a lot more than they used to. So the net of that is mature clubs are<br>doing much better, too.<br>
<b>Rafe Jason Jadrosich</b> - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate<br>
And the last question. I was surprised to see the Black Card penetration went up in the quarter that you increased the pricing. I think last quarter,<br>you've talked about you're expecting a 70 basis points benefit. Can you talk about after like having it in place for a quarter, what's your expectation<br>going forward and what you're seeing in terms of the penetration?<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. As I said, it was about a 60 basis point impact in Q4. It began January 1. It was for new Black Card members. We said when we did the pilot that<br>we saw little to no negative impact in the acquisition side of it. So it's -- it wasn't unexpected as to how that kind of came out, but it was about 70<br>basis points. I think that, as we look at 2018, the pricing should have probably 175, 200 basis points embedded into our guidance.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
Your next question comes from James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities.<br>
<b>James Lloyd Hardiman</b> - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research<br>
I wanted to touch on the cash impact of tax reform. You gave us the impact that's going to have on your income statement, non-GAAP of 39.5%<br>to maybe 25.5%. Maybe walk us through how your cash tax rate changes before and after tax reform and then the TRA impact if there is any. I know<br>that's a delayed impact. Would you give us a schedule? Just curious how that schedule is going to change as a result of different tax rates. And<br>then maybe talk a little bit about your franchisees, how tax reform is affecting them. I guess, I don't even know if they're mainly paying the corporate<br>rate or if a lot of these guys are paying the pass-through rate. But ultimately, what do you expect them to do with those savings? And does any of<br>that benefit you?<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
Sure. So previous to the tax reform, our adjusted tax rate of, call it, 39% to 40% was based upon assuming all of our shares were Class A shares and<br>all those shares -- so therefore, all of the income was taxed at the Planet Fitness, Inc. level. And today, we're roughly about, call it, 90%. 89%, 90%<br>of our income is taxed at Planet Fitness, Inc. because we have about, call it, 10%, 11% of our shares are class B shares. So at a 39% to 40% tax rate,<br>we were getting a tax deduction from the step-up basis from those stock sales, most of which were from TSG as they sold out. And we were getting<br>

that benefit at, call it, $0.40 on the dollar. And of that $0.40 on the dollar, then which reduced our cash taxes to the government, 85% of those<br>savings of that benefit went to the TRA holders, and then 15% of it stayed in the company. So the way I've always talked about it is think about<br>that our 39% tax rate was roughly because of the step-up -- we got about a 15% reduction off of that. So that was kind of the benefit to the company<br>by having this upstate tax structure in place. So now if you fast forward to, call it, 25%, 26% tax rate now with our Federal state and local tax rate<br>that we're estimating will be our full rate for 2018, now then those deductions, which that's why there was that huge deferred tax expense, which<br>I talked about that went through our P&amp;L, is that we, in essence, then we remeasured that future benefit because it's no longer worth $0.40 on the<br>dollar. It's only worth, call it, $0.25 on the dollar. But we'll be paying a lower cash tax rate using that 25%, 26%. So the way to think about it then is<br>because that we will -- with the taxable income we have, albeit reduced by this tax basis deduction that we get at a 25% rate, we'll pay significantly<br>less in cash taxes to the IRS. But we'll still pay 85% of those savings at that 25% tax rate. We'll pay those to the TRA holders. So again, it's about a<br>15% benefit to Planet Fitness, Inc. off of that 25% to 26% tax rate. So let me pause there and see if that is clear in the way that the -- kind of, in<br>essence, cash taxes and the adjusted tax rates as I just walked through, if that makes sense.<br>
<b>James Lloyd Hardiman</b> - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research<br>
It does. But I guess bottom line it for me. From a free cash flow -- after-tax free cash flow, how is that being affected by the new rates?<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. So if you look at our free cash flow, what you still have to look at is the TRA payment because it's not in your P&amp;L because you're only taxed at,<br>call it, a 25% tax rate on lower income because of the tax deduction. But you'll go to the cash flow statement, and you'll see a payment that goes<br>to the TRA holders, albeit in the following year. So for example, in 2018, when we take a tax deduction that's only worth $0.25 on the dollar, I'll<br>reduce my taxes that I pay throughout this year because you have to make quarterly payments. I'll pay less taxes to the IRS, so less cash taxes, and<br>then in 2019, I'll pay 85% of those savings out to the TRA holders. But that will go through the cash flow statement, and so you'll need to look, in<br>essence, at free cash flow less the taxes paid under the tax benefit arrangement, i.e., the TRA.<br>
<b>James Lloyd Hardiman</b> - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research<br>
And that's significant it sounds -- at the end of the day, the net of all that, I don't know if you want to give us a dollar number, but it sounds like it's<br>going to be pretty significant.<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
Well, the net of it, I think, is the point I made a minute ago, and that is, in essence, we'll be paying basically about a 15% -- we'll get about a 15%<br>benefit off of the 25% tax rate when you get right down to it because if you take my lower taxes to the government and then when you add in the<br>85% of the TRA, so you're, in essence, getting about a 15% benefit off of your statutory tax rate.<br>
<b>James Lloyd Hardiman</b> - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research<br>
That's helpful. And then on the franchisee side, any thoughts there?<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
Yes. I think a couple things is -- and obviously, we'll get this on a corporate basis as well, where capital assets outside of leaseholds, you'll get a<br>100% deduction if they are placed in service. And so we'll get that as a corporate entity. And then a franchisee, whether they're a LLC entity or a<br>corporate entity, will get immediate deduction of their CapEx assets less leaseholds. And then in addition, there's about 20% of their income that<br>is, if they're an LLC entity, that gets passed through at a 0 tax rate, subject to a limitation that's 50% of their W-2 wages. So the idea there, if you go<br>

back and you think about what the Trump tax reform act did is it basically said we're going to incent you to invest in building assets and generating<br>jobs. In essence, that's what, I believe, they're doing by this immediate write-off of an asset. But they're saying that you -- what you got to do is you<br>got to be employing people. So if you employ people, you're paying them wages. So we're going to give you a 0 tax on 20% of your income but<br>only if you have W-2 wages. And so they put that limitation of 50% of your W-2 wages in there. So that's -- I don't know what percentage of these<br>did, James, have LLCs. I'd say a fairly high percentage do, particularly the smaller guys. So I think the net of it is there is going to be incentive to<br>build stores. There's going to be incentive to replace equipment with the stores that are coming up to -- that need to have their reequips done,<br>and they'll be able to save taxes at the end of the day by doing so. So I -- net-net to our business from a franchisee perspective, I think it's positive,<br>win-win.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
The next question comes from George Kelly with Imperial Capital.<br>
<b>George Arthur Kelly</b> - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division - VP<br>
Just a couple questions for you. So first, I wanted to follow up on the equipment stuffs you've talked about, the enhanced equipment coming soon.<br>The question is how important is it for you to internally develop parts of that. And will you own a lot of the enhanced software?<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
Yes. A lot of what -- that kind of has a debt investment in the plumbing that Dorvin talked about. We want to be sure that a lot of what's captured<br>and learned from is internal us. So regardless of what manufacturer we use today or in 5 years, it's our stuff that we can bolt on to whoever we use<br>in the future. Not to mention, it stays proprietary to us, too, which is important.<br>
<b>George Arthur Kelly</b> - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division - VP<br>
Okay. And so that relates to the data but also the sort of interaction that you talk -- the media stuff you'll offer and everything else?<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
Some of the -- like Netflix is Netflix, right? How we learn from what male or female or age ranges, what they're doing, what they're using, how<br>they're using it, what their duration is, so how will we drive their experience going forward is stuff that we use and we know so that we can then<br>have the cardio react and change accordingly. So some of that will be us. But naturally, the [term is] Netflix [anytime will] get Netflix. It's how we<br>manipulate the dieter data and mine it that we change our experience in the future not -- unlike the people who aren't from New Zealand or LA<br>and how we change that going forward.<br>
<b>Dorvin Donald Lively</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - President &amp; CFO<br>
And where it could go, George, is that with our plans from a technology perspective of having this infrastructure and plumbing in place, so to<br>speak, would be that we would then have the ability to just link up from an API perspective into -- if it's another app, if it's a loyalty company program<br>we wanted to link into, things like that, that would be kind of plug and play so to speak, we'd have the ability to do that very easily and not time<br>consuming.<br>

<b>George Arthur Kelly</b> - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division - VP<br>
And then just one last question for me. It seems like your expansion into -- where you've gone international into other countries, it's been successful.<br>I know it's early in places. But what do you think about Europe? I know you're not going to -- whatever you can say there, what is the competitive<br>dynamic? Or if you could say anything on that, that would be great.<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
Sure. Yes, we're really mostly focused on most Latin America as far -- stick to this point except for Canada. We've done -- we've looked at Europe<br>briefly. It seems like each country over there kind of has their low-cost chain. There's a basic fit. There's a mix fit, and each country kind of has their<br>own. There's The Gym and PureGym in U.K. You're thinking some of [the instance], they're probably more low priced but not necessarily our model,<br>meaning judgment free and so on and so forth that you're catering to the first timer, but they are low cost. The big question is, if you look at<br>PureGym's got 180 stores in the U.K., it's probably likely to have 500 or 600 here in the States. So question is do we look to acquire or do we try to<br>go in there one at a time and compete that way. I think when we get there, we'll make that decision. But I think it reminds me more of a roll-up<br>strategy in Europe just because each country's got a pretty significant player.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
The last question is from Matthew Brooks with Macquarie. And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the<br>presenters.<br>
<b>Christopher J. Rondeau</b> - Planet Fitness, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director<br>
Great. Thank you. This is Chris. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today for the fourth quarter call and year-end. As you see, it was a great 2017, a<br>lot of good stuff happening here as a brand with the technology front. Granted it's going to be a few years to fine-tune it and work through it, but<br>it's -- I'd say, in 25 years doing this, this is, for me, some really exciting times of how we look to leverage this in the future, which is something that,<br>to be able to know what people are actually doing in our club, is pretty substantial. So it's -- we look forward to working on this in the future, and<br>thanks for the call.<br>

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Iridium Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Asa reminder,<br>this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the floor over to Ken Levy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.<br>
<b>Kenneth Levy</b><br>
Thanks, Karen. Good morning, and welcome to Iridium's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call this morning are our CEO, Matt<br>Desch, and our CFO, Tom Fitzpatrick. Today's call will begin with a discussion of our Q4 results followed by Q&amp;A. I trust you've had an opportunity<br>to review this morning's earnings release, which is available on the Investor Relations section of Iridium's website.<br>

Such forward-looking statements are<br>based upon our current beliefs and expectations and are subject to risks which could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements.<br>Such risks are more fully discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our remarks today should be considered in light<br>of such risks. Any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today, and while we may like to update forward-looking statements<br>at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our views or expectations change.<br>
During the call, we'll also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance<br>with generally accepted accounting principles. Please refer to today's earnings release and the Investor Relations section of our website for a<br>reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.<br>
With that, let me turn things over to Matt.<br>
<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Well we just completed a really great year, both in terms of our subscriber growth and the early success<br>of our Iridium NEXT program. We're halfway through the launch program and the new satellite activations continue to go very well. To date we<br>have launched 40 satellites which represents 61% of the 66 new operational satellites we need for full service and we'll be launching the final 35<br>satellites over the next few months to complete the constellation. Our NEXT Launch has moved around a bit, primarily due to the delays in the<br>[Pause] Mission that should be launching this morning from Vandenberg. Right now, it looks like our NEXT launch will be the morning of Thursday,<br>March 29, essentially 5 weeks from now, though we're still confirming that date. The 10 satellites for that launch are shipping to Vandenberg now<br>

and the first and second Falcon 9 stages are already onsite and being processed at the base. This launch again will use a flight-proven first stage.<br>It will be the 10th flight of a refurbished rocked by SpaceX. We have history with this particular first stage. It successfully launched our third batch<br>of satellites in October.<br>
Following next month's launch, our cadence with SpaceX should move more rapidly as launch frequency is planned to increase to approximately<br>one launch every 5 to 6 weeks or so. In fact, our 6th launch is currently scheduled for a quick turnaround at the end of April. That will be a rideshare<br>with the JPL German Gray satellites in which we'll utilize half of the payload to launch 5 Iridium NEXT satellites alongside the two Gray satellites<br>which will be mounted on the dispenser above ours. This rideshare has turned out to be a very efficient way to share the cost of a launch with<br>another organization, allowing us to place even more satellites into orbit than are initially planned. Specifically, we'll now be able to have 9 orbit<br>spares rather than the 6 we had originally budgeted for. SpaceX is planning a busy year and from what we can tell, they appear very capable of<br>meeting the schedule to finish our launches this summer.<br>
Moving onto our business results, 2017 was another solid year for our company. We exceeded our full year guidance for operational EBITDA and<br>continue to have positive momentum business development activities across both our commercial and government segments. Our total subscriber<br>base grew 14% leadership team fueled by strong IoT activations and this positive momentum was even before we've been able to take full advantage<br>of the capabilities of our new constellation.<br>
Our commercial business has received from much of the economic and currency headwinds that produced slower growth back in 2016 and we<br>are now operating in an environment that's supported by new IoT partners and an improving competitive position in the satellite voice market,<br>particularly in handhelds. We feel good about our market position, experience with our strong ecosystem of distribution partners. A weakening<br>dollar has also made our premium products less expensive around the world, just when we're nearing completion of our upgraded constellation<br>to deliver optimal quality.<br>
I also want to highlight the value and potential of our Push-to-Talk service which was important in storm coordination and recovery during the<br>recent hurricane season and it continues to demonstrate its value for organizations involved in disaster relief.<br>
A big bright spot for us in 2017 was IoT which continues to benefit from our alignment with large, growth ordinated partners. I'm really pleased<br>with the success we're having with heavy equipment OEMs. They increasingly rely upon us for dependable real time connections as they improve<br>the management of their global fleet assets in vehicles. We also introduced Iridium EDGE in 2017. This product is attracting new customers to<br>Iridium and helping them to get to market faster with lower implementation costs. As a result, we're sitting on a healthy pipeline of demand for<br>our IoT services and expect subscriber growth in 2018 to be in line with what we experienced in 2017.<br>
Maritime and aviation are sectors where Iridium is coming into our own and will continue to grow as we deliver faster speeds over Iridium NEXT.<br>While we've long been a player in the maritime crew voice and connectivity market, the broadband component of our revenue from this business<br>is still relatively modest at about $23 million per year, providing internet and VSAT companion service on about 8,500 ships around the world.<br>Iridium Certus, which will be launched commercially in the next few months, will give us offerings with dramatically increased capability and<br>throughput. With significant industry growth tied to broadband services, we continue to expect annual revenue from our new Iridium Certus<br>broadband offerings will reach $100 million in the next few years. And that's across all industry segments, not just maritime.<br>
In the second quarter, we are on track to commercially launch Iridium Certus service which will become the industry's fastest, most reliable and<br>most cost-effective L-Band broadband offering. In fact, we've completed our system and satellite testing and are in live operation in the field on<br>several ships. Cobham is testing its new Sailor 4300 unit and Talus is testing its new Vessel Link antennas on ships in the North Sea and Atlantic<br>Ocean, and the service is working very well. It's reliable and achieving the targeting initial rollout data speeds and is demonstrating outstanding<br>voice quality. This testing on the rough seas and in actual maritime conditions is allowing our partners to tune their products, ensure the highest<br>quality offering, and is helping them improve their installation procedures for resellers.<br>
Why we aren't counting on significant revenue from Iridium Certus in 2018, we do expect activations to start building momentum through the<br>year particularly in maritime, but also with land mobile applications as the new Talus Mission Link terminal is introduced. We're also looking forward<br>to aviation terminals being available for testing later in 2018 with commercial service on aircraft starting in 2019. While we're getting a little later<br>

start for Iridium Certus than we originally expected, Certus is arguably one of the most anticipated global product launches for many of our existing<br>and new partners in years. Our offering makes iridium a great standalone service or a perfect complement for KU and K-Band (inaudible) services,<br>especially for distributors seeking to pair the Iridium Certus service with other technologies for safety and reliability. With maritime terminals<br>available in the second quarter, our VAMs and channel partners are actively promoting the service globally today.<br>
We announced our initial distribution partners for land mobile and maritime earlier this month and they are a strong group. We will also be<br>announcing our first aviation distribution partners very soon. Across all industry segments we have aligned with premier business partners who<br>are excited to roll out this broadband offering. We expect Iridium Certus to set a new benchmark for global L-Band services.<br>
Our enduring service to the US government is a great source of pride here at Iridium. Government subscribers grew 19% in 2017 illustrating the<br>continued importance of Iridium voice and data services to the USG and we ended the year with a record 100,000 government subscribers. Our<br>longstanding relationship with the US government has provided significant value for both of us. The government has enjoyed broader and more<br>cost-effective use of Iridium's unique global services. Since our fixed price contract was initiated in 2013, the average cost per subscriber has fallen<br>by 24% for the government, while its subscriber base has nearly doubled. We continue to engage in constructive dialogue with this valued partner<br>but don't expect to have much to report on a new deal until it's completed either later this year or in 2019 if they choose to extend the current<br>contract, the additional 6 months it allows.<br>
Aireon continued to make progress in singing new customers and addressing their capital funding needs as they move to commercial service.<br>They signed 7 new MOUs in 2017 and earlier this year finalized a long-term data services contract with ASECNA, the air navigation service provider<br>managing traffic in 17 states in West Africa. We expect the company to announce additional meaningful data service contracts in the coming<br>moments.<br>
As you know, Aireon is creating a unique and powerful air traffic surveillance system that will revolutionize air traffic management. The FFA's and<br>Europe's deadline for compliance with their ADS-B equipage mandates are less than 2 years away, and aircraft installations are accelerating. With<br>A&amp;SPs managing the busiest North Atlantic tracts already signed up, along with 9 other ANSPs around the world, we are seeing the FFA continue<br>its testing of the effectiveness of Aireon's satellite-based system. Most recently, the FAA and NavCanada each completed additional successful<br>flight tests on the growing number of new payloads in space. Aireon tells us the performance they are achieving is surpassing expectations,<br>particularly with messages they've received from the test aircraft with very high fidelity. That's given Aireon and their customers a lot of confidence<br>in the capability and quality of their service to provide better air traffic management around the world.<br>
Now on a final but very important note, we have made significant progress with our credit facility lenders that should take the topic of liquidity off<br>the table as we complete the iridium NEXT mission. Tom is going to go into this in more detail about the transaction. Needless to say, I'm really<br>pleased with this resolution and where it leaves us as we enter the home stretch on Iridium NEXT. Momentum is an appropriate word to describe<br>the state of our business today. I'm very excited about the strong progress we made on launching Iridium NEXT this past year and seeing the energy<br>that continues to fuel our business and operational success. 2018 is off to a great start. I feel very good about the underlying strength of our business,<br>the new broadband services that we'll soon launch in the satellite industry, and our positioning, the ability to build new relationships with premier<br>channel partners that can drive incremental subscriber revenue for iridium. Even with the financial goals we have set this year, I am more confident<br>than ever in our business prospects and my team's ability to deliver on these commitments as we complete the Iridium NEXT mission.<br>
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for a review of our financials. Tom?<br>
<b>Thomas J. Fitzpatrick</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Chief Administrative Officer<br>
Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. With my remarks today, I'd like to start by summarizing Iridium's key financial metrics for the full year<br>and provide some color on the fourth quarter results. Then I'll walk through the 2018 financial targets we issued this morning, review our updated<br>long-range guidance, and wrap up with a discussion of our liquidity position and recent activities there.<br>
We were pleased to deliver another year of good growth in 2017. Total service revenue grew 4% and operational EBITDA exceeded our full year<br>guidance, rising to $265.6 million. This performance was driven by continued momentum in IoT and in part field by acceleration of business with<br>

heavy equipment OEMs. In the fourth quarter, Iridium reported total revenue of $115.5 million which was up 7% from last year's comparable period.<br>This growth was attributable to strength in our commercial business and incremental sales related to US hurricane readiness and post storm<br>activities.<br>
I'd like to point out that out net income for the quarter wholesale impacted by 2 nonrecurring items. The first was $150.9 million benefit in the<br>period from the effect of the newly enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Overall, the net effect over the long term will be positive for iridium, particularly<br>with the lower corporate tax rate. The other was a $22.3 million after-tax write-off of payments previously made to our supplemental launch<br>provider, Kosmotras. You'll recall we moved away from this provider when it did not meet its obligations under the need for launch program<br>contract. Today we have 40 Iridium NEXT satellites in orbit and all the SpaceX launches scheduled that we need to get our remaining satellites into<br>space for the Iridium NEXT mission.<br>
In the fourth quarter, operational EBITDA rose 4% from the prior year's quarter to $63.7 million while our operational EBITDA margin moderated<br>to 55% on higher SG&amp;A driven by a yearend true-up in management incentives. For the full year, operational EBITDA margin was steady at 59%.<br>
The commercial side of our business remained quite strong in the fourth quarter, generating revenue of $69.4 million. This is a 12% increase from<br>the prior year's quarter and was fueled by momentum in IoT as well as incremental revenue from hosting fees and data services associated with<br>new Iridium NEXT satellites put into service in 2017.<br>
Beginning this quarter, we're providing a new revenue breakout in our financial students for hosted payload and other data services which totaled<br>$4.6 million in the fourth quarter. This added detail allows investors to track hosting fee and data services revenue generated form our contracts<br>with Aireon and Harris as well as nonsubscriber base revenue from businesses like our satellite time and location service, ort STL, which became<br>material to Iridium this quarter.<br>
Our hosted payload revenues include the Aireon data service fee and Harris data and hosting fees, both of which are currently being paid in cash.<br>We have not yet begun to recognize the Aireon hosting fee, as no payment has yet been made. I'll discuss our 2018 expectation for this item later.<br>As a reminder, while re recognized approximately $2.3 million in hosting fees and data service revenue for GAAP in 2017, these revenues were<br>excluded in calculating EBITDA since they were less than the approximately $4 million in recurring Iridium NEXT expenses that we incurred during<br>the year which were similarly excluded form EBITDA.<br>
IN 2018, we expect recurring service revenue from hosting fees and data will exceed recurring Iridium NEXT expenses and both will be recognized<br>in into EBITDA.<br>
Commercial subscribers grew 13$ year-over-year. Much of this growth was the result of a 23% increase in commercial IoT subscribers, while<br>commercial voice and data subs rose 2$ in 2017. Commercial IoT added 24,000 net subscribers during the fourth quarter, pushing our IoT mix to<br>59% of billable commercial subscribers, up from 54% I the year ago period. As forecasted, our government service business remained at $22 million<br>in the fourth quarter. Government subscribers grew 19% in 2017 illustrating the continuing importance of Iridium service to the US government.<br>Total users ended the year at a record 100,000 subscribers.<br>
The impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria fueled incremental demand for Iridium equipment in the fourth quarter. Revenue from subscriber<br>equipment increased 18% year-over-year to 19.4 million while equipment margins were 42% compared to 36$ a year earlier. This increase was<br>principally associated with the elevated mix of high margin handsets compared to the year ago period. This mix should normalize with storm<br>activity now behind us. We continue to expect margins in the high 30s to low 40% area, depending on mix.<br>
Moving to the 2018 financial guidance we issued this morning, we forecast operational EBITDA in a rage of $280 million to $290 million and total<br>service revenue growth of approximately 10% to 12% for the new fiscal year. The key elements supporting this 2018 outlook are as follows. First,<br>we anticipate approximately $25 million in revenue from hosted payloads in 2018. Based upon the continued successful deployment of Iridium<br>NEXT satellites. Today, Iridium has approximately half of its new satellites in operation and will add to this total with each launch until we have all<br>66 operational satellites later this year.<br>

<A name=706></a>FEBRUARY 22, 2018 / 1:30PM, IRDM - Q4 2017 Iridium Communications Inc Earnings Call<br>
Hosted payload revenues include both hosting and data service revenue from Harris Corporation which has largely already been received in cash,<br>as well as hosting and data service revenue from Aireon. Aireon will pay the data service fee currently and the revenue will be recognized monthly<br>as satellites are deployed. Aireon's hosting fee, which is expected to contribute approximately $14 million in 2018, will similarly be recognized pro<br>rata as operational Iridium NEXT satellites are placed into service. This is provided that either Aireon's financing closes and the first installment<br>under this financing has been made to Iridium, or upon the FAA making a positive decision on utilizing space-based ADS-B which we still expect<br>in the second half of 2018. Aireon currently expects their financing to close in the second quarter of 2018.<br>
The second are key to our 2018 outlook is that we expect continued strength in IoT and are forecasting double digit subscriber growth from that<br>business line in 2018. Supporting this outlook are a number of high profile contracts, one this past year, including heavy equipment manufacturer<br>Hitachi, continued demand from Garmin and Caterpillar and ramping installations from partners like Komatsu, Duson and Honeywell that are<br>outfitting their equipment with Iridium to provide reliable, low latency telematics. Third, we expect revenue from our fixed price contract with the<br>US government will remain stray at $88 million in 2018. Our 5-year contract comes up for renewal this year and US Government has the right to<br>unilaterally extend it for an additional 6 months.<br>
Today we are updating our long-range outlook. specifically, we are narrowing our range for 2019 service revenue. We now expect service revenue<br>for the full year 2019 to be approximately $440 million. This revision reflects our latest estimate for the sales ramp of Iridium Certus now that we<br>have greater clarity on product rollout and partner marketing plans. We expect Iridium Certus revenues will reach $100 million run rate in late 2021<br>rather than as we exit 202 as previously forecasted.<br>
There are number of other factors that support this long-range revenue forecast. First, we expect continued growth in commercial services, especially<br>from IoT data where subscriber and revenue growth has been accelerating. We believe that many of the new heavy equipment partners we have<br>announced in recent quarters will have fully integrated Iridium's satellite solution into their manufacturing process and be activating their services<br>at a higher run rate.<br>
Second, we anticipate a renewal of the EMSS contract with the US government that will be favorable to both Iridium and the US government.<br>Ongoing subscriber growth within the US government bodes well for our negation and should lead to a new contract that will be a win/win for<br>both parties. Third, we expect to recognize the vast majority of the $47 million in hosted payload revenue in 2019 based upon terms of our contracts<br>with business partners Aireon and Harris and upon expected developments at Aireon.<br>
We started to recognize revenue from hosted payload last year based on each operational satellite in the Iridium NEXT constellation and expect<br>that the full constellation of 66 operational satellites will be fully deployed in 2018.<br>
Finally, in addition to Iridium Certus, other new products remain important catalysts for revenue growth. We're excited about demand for STL, a<br>service that we think will contribute meaningfully to sales, as well as commercial Push-to-Talk. Our commercial Push-to-Talk offering was effective<br>in recovery efforts following recent hurricanes and the California wildfires. We see a nice pipeline of opportunity around the world fort his service.<br>The other components of our long-range outlook, which we also are reiterating today, include expectations for operational EBITDA margin of<br>approximately 60% in 2019, negligible cash taxes through approximately 2020, peak net leverage of between 6 and 6.5x in the 2018 fiscal year,<br>and finally, net leverage of approximately 4.5x as we exit 2019.<br>
Moving to our capital structure and liquidity position, we've reached an agreement in principal with our BPI lenders which has been sanctioned<br>by the French Treasury that we believe provides Iridium with ample liquidity into 2022 even in the unlikely event that we haven't received any<br>hosting payments from Aireon. The agreement contemplates that iridium issue additional debt and for the lenders to delay certain scheduled<br>principal repayments under the BPI facility. The proceeds of any debt issued will be used to repay our Talus deferred payment note and to fully<br>fund the debt service reserve account or DSRA. The agreement would also be very flexible in that it provides Iridium with access to a portion of<br>the DSRA if our projected cash balances falls below an agreed amount. We expect to file an 8K detailing the arranged with our BPI lenders once it<br>is complete and expect this to occur no later than the second quarter.<br>
I'm very pleased I think this deal. It's good for Iridium and fully addresses our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. Iridium remains optimistic<br>in the expectation for hosting payments from Aireon this year, but feels it best to not rely on them for purposes of our liquidity. Given these pending<br>

plans, we can now complete the launch program with no concerns about liquidity. This expected debt raise would not materially impact our net<br>leverage because the proceeds of the offering will pay down existing debt and the remainder will increase our cash balance.<br>
As of December 31, 2017, Iridium had a cash and marketable securities balance of approximately $298 million. We anticipate total capital spending<br>of approximately $500 million in 2018. This spending predominantly reflects work associated with the completion of the Iridium NEXT mission. In<br>closing, I feel very good about the progress we made this past year. Our company made tremendous strides in building new business relationships,<br>generation strong subscriber growth, and replacing our legacy constellation with new satellites. We believe that the new debt deal that I just<br>described takes any liquidity concerns off the table and we eagerly await the final lunches of the Iridium NEZXT program and the financial<br>transformation it will bring to our company. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the Operator for Q&amp;A.<br>

A couple of questions on the financing. Obviously you don't have a lot of details yet, but just wanted to get some kind of framework for it. Can you<br>talk about what type of debt you're looking at and what kind of rates you're seeing in the marketplaces?<br>
<b>Thomas J. Fitzpatrick</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Chief Administrative Officer<br>
I can't describe the debt at all, Ric, for just because where we are in the process. The headline here is if you focus on -- and I've had conversations<br>with you and others about principal payments required under the BPI facility, that the deal pushed the near-term payments, reduces them and<br>pushes them out. And so kind of the headline that we're trying to give you to size it is, no liquidity issues through 2022. Even without any payments<br>from Aireon. So that's how you should think about it.<br>
<b>Richard Hamilton Prentiss</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Head of Telecommunication Services Equity Research<br>
Okay, maybe just let us know what kind of rates you're seeing in the marketplace, not that you would actually tap that bucket, but what kind of<br>rates are you seeing? We're in a rising interest rate environment, but just kind of wondering what you're seeing out there at least in the marketplace?<br>
<b>Thomas J. Fitzpatrick</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Chief Administrative Officer<br>
Well to do that, I'd have to tell you the type of debt security we're thinking about and I can't do that. So we'll give you fulsome disclosure when we<br>file the 8K.<br>

<b>Richard Hamilton Prentiss</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Head of Telecommunication Services Equity Research<br>
Definitely not that you're not going to do any equity, right? So it's not that --<br>
<b>Thomas J. Fitzpatrick</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Chief Administrative Officer<br>
We're not doing any equity raises and the security that we have in mind has no link to equity.<br>
<b>Richard Hamilton Prentiss</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Head of Telecommunication Services Equity Research<br>
Okay, that helps. And then when you think of the credit facility that's out there right now, at some point you'd probably like to take it out completely<br>as you move to more of an operational company than a construction company. What are the thoughts of what might be the gating factor to kind<br>of switch and get rid of that facility completely?<br>
<b>Thomas J. Fitzpatrick</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Chief Administrative Officer<br>
If you think about what we've done here, we've set the table for no liquidity issues through 2022. And so that gives us plenty of room as we think<br>about the opportune time to take the BPI facility out. We plan on taking it out long before 2022 because we want to do equity friendly type things<br>and there's no reason to have the kind of principal service that hat facility contemplates. So what we've done is give ourselves plenty of buffer to<br>be able to absorb disruptions in debt markets for a number of years. So we've given ourselves plenty of cushion from when we would expect to<br>take out the BPI facility.<br>
<b>Richard Hamilton Prentiss</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Head of Telecommunication Services Equity Research<br>
Okay, makes sense. More operationally, when you think of the 1029 guidance and tightening the range, moving to the low end of it, it sounds like<br>it was predominantly maybe the timing of the Certus rollout and partner plans. But just trying to think thought the comfort on the 2019 guidance<br>and if you could, kind of allude to maybe what your thoughts are as far as how much the government is in the guidance.<br>
<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
Yeah, so just to the first point, it really has nothing to do with our excitement about Certus or belief in its market value. It's just really more the<br>timing. Because it's really starting to more rollout this year and doesn't start generating a lot of steam until 2019. So the timing just seemed more<br>appropriate to narrow that down a little bit. We're feeling very, very good about the revenue generating potential for Certus and the market for it<br>and our positioning within that. The government is kind of a small part of it. We're not expecting -- I mean we haven't finished that deal yet or<br>anything here, but I mean how would you characterize it?<br>
<b>Thomas J. Fitzpatrick</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Chief Administrative Officer<br>
So what I would characterize it, we expect the government increase to be a stub period. Because they will extend until April of 2019. So the 2019<br>increase will be for only a portion of the year. That's as much guidance as we can give.<br>
<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
It obviously could happen sooner, but that's really up to the government. So it's appropriate to really just focus on the most conservative approach<br>which would be an extension.<br>

<b>Richard Hamilton Prentiss</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Head of Telecommunication Services Equity Research<br>
Sure, that makes sense. And final question is, as you think about the margins in the business and once you get past the construction, launching<br>phase, where could the margins go as we look into 2019, but more importantly, even beyond that as far as how can this business run, what kind<br>of level could it get to, when you look at compared to other guys in the space?<br>
<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
We've been pretty consistent all along believing that there's no reason why our business can't approach the same time margins that mature satellite<br>companies reach. Our cost structure doesn't change that dramatically in the coming years with the new services that we're providing and the<br>revenues continue to grow. And that expands operating margins beyond the 60% and I know others are in the 70% to 80% range and we don't<br>see any reason why we can't hit those kinds of levels as well. There's a lot of opportunity for revenue growth and we think those are very achievable.<br>
<b>Richard Hamilton Prentiss</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Head of Telecommunication Services Equity Research<br>
Some news coming out lately about SpaceX launching their own LEO platform. Obviously they've got a couple of more launches for you guys, but<br>what are your thoughts competitively and just kind of what the space looks like with OneWeb and maybe SpaceX having their own LEO platforms<br>up there?<br>
<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
There seems to be some confusion in the market, or from people I've heard, that somehow think that competition is based upon sort of architecture,<br>like LEOs compete with LEOs and GEOs compete with GEOs. You know, it's really more around spectrum and applications that people provide. So<br>today, we compete with a GEO, a major GEO network today, and LEO, I mean excuse me, OneWeb, SpaceX, those are all KU and KA-Band providers<br>who really are going to compete for those commodity broadband applications that are currently what today's KU and K-Band GEO operations are<br>involved in. So I look at those as potential partners. L-Band has a very unique place in the industry. It has a lot of advantages, particularly a global<br>one like us. For example, an easy example is on aircraft where L-Band is used primarily for cockpit operational communications for the airlines and<br>KU K-Band is used in the cabin. When any kind of new networks come along, I think they're going to compete for the cabin but they really can't be<br>regulated and provide servicing the cockpit. So it really doesn't change the competitive dynamics. SpaceX has a very interesting network. I know<br>that they're going to take some time to develop it. I think that they are really going to compete against wire line and cable operations. They need<br>to if they're going to generate the kind of revenues they has. So that's not our area. So I see us as complementary to the new players coming into<br>LEO in the say wake way I see us as complementary to the exiting KU K-band plays in GEO.<br>
<b>Richard Hamilton Prentiss</b> - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Head of Telecommunication Services Equity Research<br>
That really helps. I think there is a lot of confusion out there. Thanks.<br>

It looks like your long-term guidance basically pushes out Certus' run rate by a year and you mentioned previously that it looks like your equipment<br>terminals, at least on the maritime side, are hit in the market meeting expectations.

satellite launches and how that's progressed over the past year? Or are you seeing any issues in equipment deployments either maritime or you<br>didn't address the aviation and IoT?<br>
<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
I don't think it has anything to do really with terminals or partners. I think it has almost everything to do with our latest view of how the market will<br>ramp up. Based upon the slightly later deployments of Certus than we originally hoped. When we originally provided that guidance, the broader<br>range of guidance, we have expectations that there would be 40 to 50 satellites in operation sometime in late last year. And that Certus would be<br>ready and developed and tested and that we'd be really ramping throughout all of 2018 for Certus. And 2019 would be a big year. Now with the<br>number of satellites we had in operation only now getting to here in the next month or two and Certus launching here in n the second quarter,<br>it's going to be only a partial year in 2018 of ramp. And really more of the ramp is going to be start gathering momentum more in 2019. But we're<br>not -- we're happy with the devices that we've seen developed so far by our VAMs. We think they' are going to be really well received. They're high<br>quality devices from very reputable manufacturers. You've seen the service providers we've selected on land and maritime. We've announced those<br>in the last couple of weeks, it's a great list. It's only the initial list, there will be more that we're announcing. I think you're going to be real pleased<br>when you see the aviation partners who are going to roll this out soon and that's an impressive list as well. So still a lot of excitement and the<br>devices are coming along fine. It's just more timing. It's appropriate to tighten up the guidance now knowing we're getting a lot closer to 2019<br>now than we were when we gave you that.<br>
<b>Chris Quilty</b><br>
It's been a long time since you updated it. Also, it looks like this is I think the first time you provided any numbers around maritime, both revenues<br>and number of vessels in a number of years and I was glad to see you're actually ahead of what I was trying to forecast in the dark. Can you give<br>us a sense of what's happened in the past year or past couple of years in rate of deployment and perhaps the ARPU trends historically and what<br>you might see going forward?<br>
<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
In the last year or 2, I think it's been marked by stability really in terms of our open port products. As you remember, we had some quality issues<br>with that a number of years ago. Those have by far been addressed to the extent that that product is, I hate to use the word bullet proof, but it's<br>very, very reliable and it's seen that way in the market right now. And we continue to have had strong shipments and kind of consistent net<br>activations each year for the last 2 or 3 years. Some of those, a number of those are standalone applications on what I'd call the value sort of platers<br>that look for instead of an always-on connection, really want to pay as they go. A lot of them are being installed as companion vehicles to VSAT<br>providers to ensure they week where VDAT doesn't work or in regulatory environments like ports where they're not able to be turned on. Certainly,<br>in polar kind of regions and actually getting a lot of services. The ARPUS have been pretty stable in the last year, probably in a slight decline just<br>as prices have improved and as business service is stabilized to what I think the level that that service can provide. It can only go up to 128 kilobytes<br>per second. What the new Certus devices going from 352 to 704 pretty quickly here in 2019, I think we're going to see ARPUS increase with that<br>product more applications, more standalone applications and of course it will continue to be a great companion device. So I think the competitive<br>dynamics also have helped us in open parts. Partners want to deploy Open Port with their VSAT terminals versus other solutions for reasons that<br>I think you understand and that also has given us a lot of market strength.<br>
<b>Chris Quilty</b><br>
Great. One final question on Aireon. 2017 looked like a pretty good year in terms of sign-ups for MOUs. Do you have a sense of how many of those<br>may convert into actual data service agreements in 2018&amp;gt; And what's the remaining funnel? Who decides the FAA of significant has not yet<br>signed up?<br>

<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
I can't remember the percentage of the world that signed up in data service agreements versus MOUs. I used to try to keep track of that even on<br>my board. But all those -- there's a long list of ANSPs in the world who are evaluating the service and are contemplating signing up. Really 100%<br>for the planet eventual is the market and that's quite substantial. A lot of those have been waiting until it gets closer to commercial deployment<br>to commit, but I'm really impressed I think their pipeline in 2018. There is a really significant group of customers who are in discussions right towards<br>data service contracts including some very large ANSPs. So we're expecting as we get close to finalizing the network and they are looking to go<br>commercial here later this year and starting turning their service off, you're going to start seeing a lot more data service contracts. And some<br>significant ones at that, too.<br>
<b>Chris Quilty</b><br>
And has Flight Aware had any success in basically brokering that service to commercial customers yet? OR is it being offered?<br>
<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
Yes, they are offering the service to airlines for airline connectivity and information. My conversations, in my last conversations, there were very<br>happy with how that was extending their service. They had already been in that business. What they offered was a good service, but Aireon makes<br>it a great service because it really means that they can provide some precise information to airlines. And they were telling me they were very happy<br>with how that was working out. That that -- I mean they already have a great relationship with airlines and lots of contracts that just augments and<br>improves. So I'm hearing good things about that.<br>
<b>Operator</b><br>
James Breen, William Blair<br>
<b>James Dennis Breen</b> - William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Communication Services Analyst<br>
This is Eric for Jim. With the 2018 service revenue guidance, I just wonder if you can just give us some of the puts and takes, what's going into that.<br>How much of that is Certus and hosting? And then secondly, if you could just remind us on the timing of the expiration of the DESA government<br>contract and what gives you confidence that there will be a favorable step up for Iridium there?<br>
<b>Thomas J. Fitzpatrick</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Chief Administrative Officer<br>
Sure. So I'm not going to parse out all the elements that make up our guidance, but we did indicate that hosted payloads is $25 million. A little<br>more background on the Aireon data fee which is charged and paid monthly, it's based on a fee for each of the 66 NEXT satellites in operation. The<br>fee is impacted by a customer contract milestone which when cleared causes the monthly fee for operating satellite to increase form approximately<br>$16,000 per month to approximately $28,500 per month per operating satellite. So our guidance assumes the lower rate in 2018, thus arriving at<br>the approximately $8 million number. And the higher number for the majority of 2019. So that's pretty detailed guidance on what we're thinking<br>as far as hosted payloads. You would observe as the IoT business grew 13%, grew revenue=s 13% and we don't see that stopping, so that's certainly<br>going to be helpful. We think the Talus revenues will be up materially. We see stability in our commercial voice and data ARPU, you saw that in the<br>most recent quarter. We view commercial voice and data ARPU as quite firm. And so that's kind of the analysis going into the guide. I would say<br>what gives us confidence that we're going to get a government renewal is our sort of 20-year history with the US government. The fact that they're<br>growing their subs at 19%, we think the outcome, as I said in my prepared remarks, will be a win for us and will be a win for them. And our part of<br>the win is our revenues will go up.<br>

<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
Yeah, we don't want to negotiate in public around that and describe our complete argument, but we've made it and believe it's well received.<br>Given the growth as we've said in subscribers in terms of doubling the subscribers, but the cost per subscriber has been declining. There is room<br>there to sort of recover a little bit of that in an unlimited environment which we continue to billion there will be. A lot of other positive things have<br>happened recently too. As you know, we just started shipping the first new secure handset that they've had in quite a number of years. Smaller,<br>lighter, better. The distributed tactical communication services global is moving and there are more tactical radios on different platforms. You<br>might have seen the announcement yesterday of a new platform for all of the basically aviation raised that the government uses called the Rapid<br>Cones R210. Their ability to expand that. And then IoT is really expanding broadly in a whole bunch of areas in Blue Force tracking kind of applications,<br>vehicle tracking, fuel monitoring, all kinds of other applications. So on all that basis we're not projecting large growth necessarily in this area, but<br>some growth is appropriate and still ends up bringing a lot of value to the government. So I think this is a positive time and we feel pretty good<br>about our position together as we work towards this new deal.<br>
<b>James Dennis Breen</b> - William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Communication Services Analyst<br>
And then just on the timing of that contract, does the current contract expire in the third quarter?<br>
<b>Thomas J. Fitzpatrick</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Chief Administrative Officer<br>
It expires in October, but as I said in my remarks, the government has the option to extend it for 6 months unilaterally.<br>
<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
So that's why we've keep generally the revenues this year and just assumed that they would sign. They have expressed interests on singing on<br>time and going to a new contract this year and perhaps that will still happen. But the last time we did this, they went down to the wire and it got<br>extended 6 months, so we're just forecasting that again for simplicity here.<br>

(Operator Instructions) Andrew Spinola, Wells Fargo.<br>
<b>Andrew Carl Spinola</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst<br>
Thanks. Matt, I think you might have just elaborated on it, but I might have, I think I might have missed it. The recent contract with Comsat where<br>they are going to sell Certus into the government, I think you had said previously it's possible that Certus won't be a part of the new contract. So<br>is it correct to think about it that you're going to be likely extending something that looks a lot similar to what you're doing today? And then you're<br>going to have other opportunities to sell into that market with Certus through these partnerships?<br>
<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
Yeah, that's exactly the way to look at it. It could still turn out differently, but the general feeling between us is that what we've been doing for the<br>last 5 years obviously has worked very well. So maintaining that structure for kind of unlimited service for a very specific narrow band applications<br>makes the most sense. And the government really procures broadband services in a different way anyway. And that really shouldn't be an unlimited<br>service, so it's going to be a more pay for use. Comsat by the way was the perfect choice. They are the primary vehicle today for providing broadband<br>to the, L-Band broadband to the US government. And given when you move into the broadband space, applications care more important than<br>they are on the narrow banc side. Expertise and service, for security and all kinds of other applications are real important. So Comsat is a great<br>vehicle for that and an ideal way to move quickly into the government. Who by the way, is already deploying, is really planning on in 2018 deploying<br>

Certus information at their gateway. So even in advance of sort of a formal contract there, they are getting ready for Certus to be able to utilize it<br>even in 2018 and certainly in 2019 and 2020 as that really comes onboard and they can move into it.<br>
<b>Andrew Carl Spinola</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst<br>
Got it. Tom, will the revenue essentially be the same for the 6-month extension period, the 22 per quarter?<br>
<b>Thomas J. Fitzpatrick</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Chief Administrative Officer<br>
That's right.<br>
<b>Andrew Carl Spinola</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst<br>
Got it. And Matt, could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on your commentary earlier on the call about the competitive situation in the voice<br>market right now? What is it you're seeing in the market? What's happening?<br>
<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
Well there's primary -- there's 4 competitors in that market. We've been by far, as the premium and I think highest quality and furthest reaching<br>solution, have done better than anyone else over the years. But as you know, people have made runs at us in the past with low cost devices thinking<br>they'd kind of peel away a lot of customers and that hasn't been very successful. The floor though is shrinking. Certainly, we know one has kind of<br>moved into becoming a spectrum arbitrager. And in fact, I'm not even sure they have new handsets anymore. It doesn't look like they've invested<br>in a new handset. They're announced nothing nor do the channels know of anything. I don't believe they even have new handsets to sell. Another,<br>as you know, a regional operator in the Middle East has not figured out what its future is. And really, the partner abase ad customer base knows<br>that they may be timing out. So I think their revenues are declining as people are afraid to make major new commitments to them for handsets.<br>So essentially the floor has shrunk to 2 and that environment is well understood and we don't see anybody else kind of coming along there. Even<br>as we've been adding new company. Push-to-Talk has been a new adder in the last couple of years and there's a really pretty broad pipeline around<br>the world for lots of -- Department of Emergency Services and MODs and others who like PPT and we see the aviation segment just introduced a<br>product for PTT, Latitude is going to provide it for like medevac and other kind of applications in aviation where Push-to-Talk makes sense. So all<br>that kind of goes to say that why we're seeing so much stability wright now in that space as opposed to couple of years ago where it was slight<br>decline over time. Especially as the dollar was going up, it was making our products more expensive and we were seeing decline but we're not<br>seeing that as much right now.<br>
<b>Andrew Carl Spinola</b> - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst<br>
Got it. Last question for me. Tom, I think it was last quarter or in the last 2 quarters, you were talking about doing sort of a term loan and sort of a<br>one-time takeout of the credit facility. I know there's a lot of details to come, but is the right way to understand what's happening now is that you're<br>not going to be doing that, you're going to be raising debt to handle the interest and principal payments. And so any real takeout of this facility is<br>likely not going to occur until 2022 at this point?<br>
<b>Thomas J. Fitzpatrick</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Chief Administrative Officer<br>
We would see the BPI facility coming out before 2022 for sure. What we described over the past couple of quarters was a situation where the<br>takeout, when we're done with our launch campaign was feasible and we're hearing that from a lot of banks. But I think what we said was, threading<br>the needle that tight when we had a March of 2019 maturity didn't feel right for us. You'd have to bet that everything went fine with the launches<br>and just as soon as you got done, you'd refinance. And that was little too close for our comfort. And so I think what we've sad was that a renegotiation<br>

with the BPI lenders to deal with the March of 2019 maturities was what we were working on. This is the result of that. But we would just reiterate<br>that we would see taking out the BPI facility before 2022 is the likely case.<br>
<b>Matthew J. Desch</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CEO<br>
Our strategy really hasn't changed on our belief and really kind of timing even on that. But we weren't going to take it out completely until we<br>completed the launch program and finished the capital program anyway, so this is sort of an interim step.<br>
<b>Thomas J. Fitzpatrick</b> - Iridium Communications Inc. - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Chief Administrative Officer<br>
Exactly. The gating item was the march of 2019 maturity that we knew was a problem and we're delighted with the outcome, Andrew. We feel it<br>gives us ample cushion and takes liquidity off the table.<br>

Thanks, everybody, for being on the call. I'm noticing that SpaceX launch looks like it was a success this morning. That was important because they<br>needed to get off the pad so we can get in that facility, so that means our satellites can start processing tomorrow at Vandenberg and that kind of<br>gives us a lot more clarity on our launch in about 5 weeks. So look forward to seeing you shortly after that to give the 21 numbers, and we'll see<br>you then. Or first quarter numbers, yes. Thanks. Take care, everybody.<br>
