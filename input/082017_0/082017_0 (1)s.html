<b>Operator</b><br>
Thank you for standing by and welcome to the IMDEX Full Year Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand<br>the conference over to Mr. Bernie Ridgeway, Managing Director. Please go ahead.<br>
<b>Bernard William Ridgeway</b> - Imdex Limited - MD &amp; Director<br>
Thanks, Jenny. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining today as we present IMDEX's results for the 2017 financial year. Paul Evans, our CFO and<br>company secretary is also on the call and will provide more detail regarding our financial results. The presentation will take approximately 15 to<br>20 minutes, and then Paul and I are happy to answer questions. I will begin with a brief overview of our company. However, for listeners who are<br>not familiar with the IMDEX Group, additional information is being included in the appendices to the presentation, and we encourage you to visit<br>our website.<br>
Firstly, a quick overview of what we do and our vision for the future, we are a leading global mining equipment, technology and services or METS<br>company. Our solutions improve the process of identifying and extracting what is below the earth's surface by joining contractors and resource<br>companies. In short, we let our clients know where it is and what it is in real-time or near real-time. Our clear vision is to be the leading provider of<br>realtime subsurface intelligence solutions to the global minerals industry.<br>
Looking now at highlights for FY '17 on Slide 3. Financially, we had a strong year. We exceeded our revenue and profit targets, and at 30 June, we<br>had a significantly stronger balance sheet. We paid our Bain capital in full and improved our capital structure by a way of a successful capital raising<br>and new finance facilities with Bankwest. We completed the divestment of our wholly owned oil and gas businesses. And since the beginning of<br>this calendar year, we had been 100% focused on the global minerals industry. In line with our commitment to delivering leading technologies<br>and solution sets, we continue to invest in R&amp;D and commercialize new technologies that differentiate IMDEX in the market. They have also<br>contributed to the growth in the REFLEX rental fleet, which I will refer to later in the presentation.<br>
In early calendar '17, we released a new version of the REFLEX HUB which is now known as IMDEXHUB-IQ. This provides us with a significant<br>advantage over our competitors. I'm pleased to report that there have been a number of recent examples where customers have chosen IMDEX<br>technologies over competitors due to our connectivity and the ability to view data from anywhere at any time. To complement our differentiated<br>technology and product capability, we commenced an internal digital transformation project during the year. This is an exciting project that will<br>enhance our systems and processes. And importantly, will allow us to significantly improve our customer service and business outcomes.<br>
As announced during the year, we were pleased to welcome 2 new board members; Anthony Wooles who was appointed Non-Executive Chairman<br>on 1 July 2016; and Sally-Anne Layman who joined as a Non-Executive Director by 6 February 2017.<br>
Moving now to Slide 4, which shows our key metrics. Revenues from our minerals business was $176.2 million for the year, a 23% increase on the<br>previous year. EBITDA from continuing operations is up 55% to $31.5 million. We recorded a net profit after tax of $3.7 million.<br>
Our operating cash flow from continuing operations for FY '17 private financing cost was $20.7 million, a 107% increase on a normalized equivalent<br>for the prior year. And as mentioned earlier, we strengthened our balance sheet. At 30 June 2017, net assets had increased by $44.2 million, and<br>we had net cash of $12.3 million.<br>

<A name=3></a>AUGUST 21, 2017 / 2:00AM, IMD.AX - Full Year 2017 Imdex Ltd Earnings Call<br>
As at 30 June 2017, our global workforce had reduced by 7% to 437 people, which reflects our divestment of AMC Oil &amp; Gas and increased activity<br>for our minerals business. Additional personnel for our minerals business have principally been in sales and operations.<br>
Slide 5 shows our minerals revenue for the year by region. As you can see, all regions grew their revenue from the previous year, which illustrates<br>the breadth of the recovery in the minerals sector. Approximately 40% of our revenues generated in the Americas, 35% in Asia Pac and the remaining<br>25% in EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Due to our global presence, we are well-positioned to benefit from the recovery<br>in all the major mining regions. And encouragingly, we have seen increasing activity continuing into FY '18.<br>
Before I speak more about our operations and market conditions, I'll hand over to Paul to provide more details regarding our financial performance.<br>
<b>Paul Anthony Evans</b> - Imdex Limited - CFO &amp; Company Secretary<br>
Thank you, Bernie. The EBITDA results for our ongoing minerals business shows a similar trend to that of revenue. However, it is even more<br>encouraging. You can see as revenue increases, we are able to generate some good fixed cost leverage from our business.<br>
It is also important to note that through the depth of the downturn, our minerals business remain profitable. During 4Q '17, our earnings were<br>impacted by additional investment in personnel. However, we maintained a disciplined approach to cost while driving revenue growth. We expected<br>EBITDA margin expansion in FY '18 while increasing investment in the business. These initiatives over the coming years should reduce the cyclicality<br>of our business and provide a more sustainable revenue and earnings stream.<br>
Moving to Slide 7, as mentioned earlier, we have a strong balance sheet with net assets increased by $44.2 million. Gross bank debt is $7.1 million<br>versus our cash position of $19.4 million. Our receivables and payables increased during the year. However, this is consistent with the uplift in<br>business activity where revenue increased by 23% over FY '16.<br>
Debtor days outstanding were on target at 62 days at the end of FY '17. As announced in our 1H '17 results presentation, the oil and gas technology<br>that was on the balance sheet at $3.6 million -- $3.2 million at 30 June 2016 has been written off, and we have no exposure to the energy sector in<br>the balance sheet.<br>
The waterfall on the right of Slide 7 shows our reconciliation of our continuing operations from the FY '17 EBITDA results to the cash flow from<br>operations prior to financing cost. From the EBITDA result of $31.5 million, there was a net inflow of operating cash from continuing operations,<br>prior to financing cost of $20.7 million. After $3.4 million of tax paid in certain regions and other minor items, there has been an investment of<br>working capital over the course of the year of $5.9 million. I'll now pass back to Bernie for the remainder of the presentation.<br>
<b>Bernard William Ridgeway</b> - Imdex Limited - MD &amp; Director<br>
Thanks, Paul. As shown on Slide 8, the main activity or mineral industry hotspots are in Canada, the western part of the United States, Latin America,<br>West Africa and Australia. You can also see from our locations where our global business with operational leverage, and we are where the money<br>is being spent.<br>
Slide 9 provides further information about market conditions during the year. We witnessed the beginning of the recovery in the minerals market<br>in 4Q '16, which was largely due to stronger gold price and associated capital raising at that time by companies operating in the sector. Since that<br>time, however, we've seen the emergence of a broader-based recovery. Resource companies are generally well funded and the miners are generating<br>free cash as the result of improved -- improving commodity prices, cost reduction and efficiency programs. The junior resource companies have<br>also been able to raise cash from [nifty] markets and are actively exploring. New technologies are gaining momentum in order to drive efficiencies<br>and productivity. We are delivering these technologies which provides a good segue into the next slide.<br>

<A name=4></a>AUGUST 21, 2017 / 2:00AM, IMD.AX - Full Year 2017 Imdex Ltd Earnings Call<br>
Our REFLEX minerals fleet has traditionally been a lead indicator of market conditions within the minerals industry. As more rigs return to work,<br>more instruments are required. It is interesting to know that instruments are higher, increased across the calendar year '14 and '16 period despite<br>significant decrease in exploration expenditure over those 3 years. We believe this is vindication of our differentiated technologies.<br>
At 30 June 2017, the number of instruments on rent was up 42% compared to 30 June 2016. The increase in demand is for traditional survey and<br>core orientation instrumentation, together with our more recent technologies, which generally yield high rental rates due to the additional value<br>they provide to customers. Our instruments are not commodity-specific. However, the largest driver of rental is activity in the gold and copper<br>commodities which leads us onto the next slide.<br>
So Slide 11 shows an interesting insight in terms of exploration spend, discoveries and production in the gold and copper markets.<br>
The chart on the left-hand side shows gold discoveries or the lack of them, represented by the blue bars despite the large increase in expenditure,<br>which is the yellow line, which peaked in 2012. The purple line shows gold production increasing in a time when discoveries have been unsuccessful.<br>Hence, the statement of gold companies are not replacing reserves at the rate they are mining them. The situation for copper is very similar as<br>shown by the chart on the right-hand side.<br>
If you then take into account that grades are decreasing, ore bodies are deeper and more complex and when you find them, they are more difficult<br>and take longer to develop. The lack of reserves is largely underpinning activity within the minerals industry, and I believe that we are in the early<br>stages of a cyclical upswing. This view is supported by what we are seeing on the ground and our customers.<br>
Before moving to the summary on Slide 13, I would like to reiterate that we are focused on organic growth by protecting and growing our core<br>business while working on transformational initiatives that are designed to reduce the cyclicality of our business. And ultimately, deliver more<br>sustainable earnings growth for our shareholders.<br>
Finally, turning to the summary and outlook on Slide 13. Our company performed well during the year, boosted by increased activity globally and<br>demand for the efficiency that our technologies are delivering. The improved market conditions were reflected in our REFLEX instruments are<br>higher and as of 30 June 2017, the total fleet is up 42% on the prior year. The outlook for IMDEX remains positive. The global minerals industry is<br>in the early stages of a cyclical upswing and activity has increased across all the major mining regions. This uplift was initially driven by the stronger<br>gold price. However, these are now broader-based recovery. There also remains a fundamental need to replace diminishing reserves. Resource<br>companies are well funded and new technologies are gaining momentum within the industry to drive greater efficiency and productivity.<br>
IMDEX is delivering these real-time or near real-time technologies. For the balance of FY '18, we'll focus on our ongoing commitment to health and<br>safety, achieving and exceeding financial targets, strategic business development to deliver sustainable earnings growth for shareholders, increasing<br>our capability to deliver IMDEX' vision of being the leading provider of real-time subsurface intelligence solutions to the global minerals industry.<br>The company is in a strong position to capitalize on improving conditions within the global minerals industry and anticipate a stronger financial<br>performance in FY '18. That brings the formal part of our presentation to an end, and I thank you for calling in today and your interest in IMDEX.<br>Paul and I are now happy to take any questions you may have.<br>

<b>Operator</b><br>
So I'll hand back to you to make closing remarks.<br>
<b>Bernard William Ridgeway</b> - Imdex Limited - MD &amp; Director<br>
Thanks, Jenny. Many thanks for dialing into this call. But before finishing, I'd like to leave you with the following comments. The balance sheet is<br>in great shape and we're well placed to support the growth of our business. We have invested in technology development throughout the cycle.<br>The resource companies and drilling contractors are looking at ways to reduce cost and increase efficiencies. It is these new products and services<br>which are assisting them to do that. And the depth of experience across our business and the sophistication and application of our technologies<br>have never been better, and we look forward with optimism as we apply our strengths to increase revenue and profits. Thank you again for dialing<br>in.<br>
