1,NA,"AUGUST 21, 2017",Full Year 2017 Imdex Ltd Earnings Call,Bernard William Ridgeway,Imdex Limited,MD & Director,False,True,"Thanks, Jenny. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining today as we present IMDEX's results for the 2017 financial year. Paul Evans, our CFO andcompany secretary is also on the call and will provide more detail regarding our financial results. The presentation will take approximately 15 to20 minutes, and then Paul and I are happy to answer questions. I will begin with a brief overview of our company. However, for listeners who arenot familiar with the IMDEX Group, additional information is being included in the appendices to the presentation, and we encourage you to visitour website. Firstly, a quick overview of what we do and our vision for the future, we are a leading global mining equipment, technology and services or METScompany. Our solutions improve the process of identifying and extracting what is below the earth's surface by joining contractors and resourcecompanies. In short, we let our clients know where it is and what it is in real-time or near real-time. Our clear vision is to be the leading provider ofrealtime subsurface intelligence solutions to the global minerals industry. Looking now at highlights for FY '17 on Slide 3. Financially, we had a strong year. We exceeded our revenue and profit targets, and at 30 June, wehad a significantly stronger balance sheet. We paid our Bain capital in full and improved our capital structure by a way of a successful capital raisingand new finance facilities with Bankwest. We completed the divestment of our wholly owned oil and gas businesses. And since the beginning ofthis calendar year, we had been 100% focused on the global minerals industry. In line with our commitment to delivering leading technologiesand solution sets, we continue to invest in R&D and commercialize new technologies that differentiate IMDEX in the market. They have alsocontributed to the growth in the REFLEX rental fleet, which I will refer to later in the presentation. In early calendar '17, we released a new version of the REFLEX HUB which is now known as IMDEXHUB-IQ. This provides us with a significantadvantage over our competitors. I'm pleased to report that there have been a number of recent examples where customers have chosen IMDEXtechnologies over competitors due to our connectivity and the ability to view data from anywhere at any time. To complement our differentiatedtechnology and product capability, we commenced an internal digital transformation project during the year. This is an exciting project that willenhance our systems and processes. And importantly, will allow us to significantly improve our customer service and business outcomes. As announced during the year, we were pleased to welcome 2 new board members; Anthony Wooles who was appointed Non-Executive Chairmanon 1 July 2016; and Sally-Anne Layman who joined as a Non-Executive Director by 6 February 2017. Moving now to Slide 4, which shows our key metrics. Revenues from our minerals business was $176.2 million for the year, a 23% increase on theprevious year. EBITDA from continuing operations is up 55% to $31.5 million. We recorded a net profit after tax of $3.7 million. Our operating cash flow from continuing operations for FY '17 private financing cost was $20.7 million, a 107% increase on a normalized equivalentfor the prior year. And as mentioned earlier, we strengthened our balance sheet. At 30 June 2017, net assets had increased by $44.2 million, andwe had net cash of $12.3 million.     As at 30 June 2017, our global workforce had reduced by 7% to 437 people, which reflects our divestment of AMC Oil & Gas and increased activityfor our minerals business. Additional personnel for our minerals business have principally been in sales and operations. Slide 5 shows our minerals revenue for the year by region. As you can see, all regions grew their revenue from the previous year, which illustratesthe breadth of the recovery in the minerals sector. Approximately 40% of our revenues generated in the Americas, 35% in Asia Pac and the remaining25% in EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Due to our global presence, we are well-positioned to benefit from the recoveryin all the major mining regions. And encouragingly, we have seen increasing activity continuing into FY '18. Before I speak more about our operations and market conditions, I'll hand over to Paul to provide more details regarding our financial performance."
2,NA,"AUGUST 21, 2017",Full Year 2017 Imdex Ltd Earnings Call,Paul Anthony Evans,Imdex Limited,CFO & Company Secretary,False,True,"Thank you, Bernie. The EBITDA results for our ongoing minerals business shows a similar trend to that of revenue. However, it is even moreencouraging. You can see as revenue increases, we are able to generate some good fixed cost leverage from our business. It is also important to note that through the depth of the downturn, our minerals business remain profitable. During 4Q '17, our earnings wereimpacted by additional investment in personnel. However, we maintained a disciplined approach to cost while driving revenue growth. We expectedEBITDA margin expansion in FY '18 while increasing investment in the business. These initiatives over the coming years should reduce the cyclicalityof our business and provide a more sustainable revenue and earnings stream. Moving to Slide 7, as mentioned earlier, we have a strong balance sheet with net assets increased by $44.2 million. Gross bank debt is $7.1 millionversus our cash position of $19.4 million. Our receivables and payables increased during the year. However, this is consistent with the uplift inbusiness activity where revenue increased by 23% over FY '16. Debtor days outstanding were on target at 62 days at the end of FY '17. As announced in our 1H '17 results presentation, the oil and gas technologythat was on the balance sheet at $3.6 million -- $3.2 million at 30 June 2016 has been written off, and we have no exposure to the energy sector inthe balance sheet. The waterfall on the right of Slide 7 shows our reconciliation of our continuing operations from the FY '17 EBITDA results to the cash flow fromoperations prior to financing cost. From the EBITDA result of $31.5 million, there was a net inflow of operating cash from continuing operations,prior to financing cost of $20.7 million. After $3.4 million of tax paid in certain regions and other minor items, there has been an investment ofworking capital over the course of the year of $5.9 million. I'll now pass back to Bernie for the remainder of the presentation."

As shown on Slide 8, the main activity or mineral industry hotspots are in Canada, the western part of the United States, Latin America,West Africa and Australia. You can also see from our locations where our global business with operational leverage, and we are where the moneyis being spent. Slide 9 provides further information about market conditions during the year. We witnessed the beginning of the recovery in the minerals marketin 4Q '16, which was largely due to stronger gold price and associated capital raising at that time by companies operating in the sector. Since thattime, however, we've seen the emergence of a broader-based recovery. Resource companies are generally well funded and the miners are generatingfree cash as the result of improved -- improving commodity prices, cost reduction and efficiency programs. The junior resource companies havealso been able to raise cash from [nifty] markets and are actively exploring. New technologies are gaining momentum in order to drive efficienciesand productivity. We are delivering these technologies which provides a good segue into the next slide.     Our REFLEX minerals fleet has traditionally been a lead indicator of market conditions within the minerals industry. As more rigs return to work,more instruments are required. It is interesting to know that instruments are higher, increased across the calendar year '14 and '16 period despitesignificant decrease in exploration expenditure over those 3 years. We believe this is vindication of our differentiated technologies. At 30 June 2017, the number of instruments on rent was up 42% compared to 30 June 2016. The increase in demand is for traditional survey andcore orientation instrumentation, together with our more recent technologies, which generally yield high rental rates due to the additional valuethey provide to customers. Our instruments are not commodity-specific. However, the largest driver of rental is activity in the gold and coppercommodities which leads us onto the next slide. So Slide 11 shows an interesting insight in terms of exploration spend, discoveries and production in the gold and copper markets. The chart on the left-hand side shows gold discoveries or the lack of them, represented by the blue bars despite the large increase in expenditure,which is the yellow line, which peaked in 2012. The purple line shows gold production increasing in a time when discoveries have been unsuccessful.Hence, the statement of gold companies are not replacing reserves at the rate they are mining them. The situation for copper is very similar asshown by the chart on the right-hand side. If you then take into account that grades are decreasing, ore bodies are deeper and more complex and when you find them, they are more difficultand take longer to develop. The lack of reserves is largely underpinning activity within the minerals industry, and I believe that we are in the earlystages of a cyclical upswing. This view is supported by what we are seeing on the ground and our customers. Before moving to the summary on Slide 13, I would like to reiterate that we are focused on organic growth by protecting and growing our corebusiness while working on transformational initiatives that are designed to reduce the cyclicality of our business. And ultimately, deliver moresustainable earnings growth for our shareholders. Finally, turning to the summary and outlook on Slide 13. Our company performed well during the year, boosted by increased activity globally anddemand for the efficiency that our technologies are delivering. The improved market conditions were reflected in our REFLEX instruments arehigher and as of 30 June 2017, the total fleet is up 42% on the prior year. The outlook for IMDEX remains positive. The global minerals industry isin the early stages of a cyclical upswing and activity has increased across all the major mining regions. This uplift was initially driven by the strongergold price. However, these are now broader-based recovery. There also remains a fundamental need to replace diminishing reserves. Resourcecompanies are well funded and new technologies are gaining momentum within the industry to drive greater efficiency and productivity. IMDEX is delivering these real-time or near real-time technologies. For the balance of FY '18, we'll focus on our ongoing commitment to health andsafety, achieving and exceeding financial targets, strategic business development to deliver sustainable earnings growth for shareholders, increasingour capability to deliver IMDEX' vision of being the leading provider of real-time subsurface intelligence solutions to the global minerals industry.The company is in a strong position to capitalize on improving conditions within the global minerals industry and anticipate a stronger financialperformance in FY '18. That brings the formal part of our presentation to an end, and I thank you for calling in today and your interest in IMDEX.Paul and I are now happy to take any questions you may have."
