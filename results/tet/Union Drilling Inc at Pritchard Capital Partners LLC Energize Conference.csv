1,18608896,UNION DRILLING INC,01/04/2012,10:30PM,UDRL,"Union Drilling Inc at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC ""Energize` Conference",Chris Strong,"Union Drilling, Inc.","President, CEO",False,True,False,"Thank you, Brad. Good afternoon.Thank you to Pritchard for having Union Drilling invited to present today.We are a land driller, primarily supportingoil and gas production in the United States. At the moment 51 drilling rigs, and most of what we are doing, like the rest of the publicly tradeddrillers, is focusing on horizontal drilling in major US formations. As of just before the end of the year our market cap was $145 million. We operate in several of the major basins -- Appalachia. We are in the Marcellus, Huron and very recently over in Ohio in the Utica Shale, which ispicking up steam, 19 rigs in that market. Of the 14 that are operating those are mostly our large rigs. We have a few remaining smaller rigs up inthat market that we are using to do verticals, top hole type work, that sort of thing, but pretty well utilized as far as the larger rigs in our fleet. Texas, 20 rigs running. That is Barnett Shale. Much lower Barnett concentration now, as you might imagine, with the advent of much lower naturalgas prices. In the beginning of 2010 we only had one rig running in the Permian. At this point we have 16 of those 20 rigs running in the Permian,with the other four in the Barnett. We are probably going to see more activity on the oil side. It is also probably an area where we will see someexpansion of margins in 2012. Then the Arkoma Basin, Fayetteville area, we are pretty solidly grounded there. We do a lot of work for XTO, or Exxon now that XTO has beenpurchased by Exxon in that market. We are also seeing BHB with its recent $5 billion acquisition from Chesapeake of acreage there. That has beena positive for us, given that Chesapeake ran its own rigs in the market and BHP is using non-Chesapeake rigs going forward. We are also seeing similar size rig demand in this market over in North-Central Oklahoma and in Southern Kansas with the Mississippi and horizontaloil play picking up steam. Also, we have several rigs at this point out of this 12 that are running in the Granite Wash a little further west in Oklahoma. What is our strategy? Really to be able to run rigs for the kinds of customers that we are working for.There has been a huge uptick in the attentionto safety. We have invested heavily in our crews, training programs, our equipment. As far as modernizing the fleet, we recently in the fourth quarter sold off 31 of our smaller rigs at auction. Those rigs where legacy rigs from whenwe started in the Appalachian Basin and some legacy rigs that we acquired to enter into the Arkoma Basin market. We have essentially replacedthose smaller rigs with larger, more capable rigs, newer rigs that are more able to drill the long horizontals that we are seeing in demand thesedays. I think it has been very important for us as well to continue to focus on markets with low F&D costs. A lot of the E&P presentations will show thatthe Marcellus has attractive economics at much lower natural gas prices than some of the other basins.That is also why we have moved out of theBarnett over into the Permian Basin, to shift from oil to natural gas."
