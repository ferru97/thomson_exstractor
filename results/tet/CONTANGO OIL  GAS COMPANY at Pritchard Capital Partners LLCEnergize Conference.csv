1,18608942,CONTANGO OIL & GAS COMPANY,01/04/2012,6:55PM,MCF,"CONTANGO OIL & GAS COMPANY at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC""Energize` Conference",Ken Peak,Contango Oil & Gas Company,"Chairman, CEO and Director",False,True,False,"Okay, thank you. Okay, this is also being webcast, if I'm not mistaken. So it's, I guess, the people at home will have the slides -- this is a twist -- thepeople in the room do not have the slides. But the slides are on their way. They'll be here in about maybe less than five minutes, hopefully. I think I'll try to give the same presentation so that when the slides do get here, we can go straight to it. I don't have all 20 slides memorized, butI've got a couple of them sitting fresh on my memory bank. The first slide is something that I start with every time. And when I look at the value creation event in our business, is when someone takes riskcapital and turns the drill bit to the right, and finds reserves that didn't exist yesterday. And that has -- I believe that's true for all companies, whetheryou're in the shale business or the shelf. And that is where we have focus. We started the Company in 1999 with an exploration focus. We continue to do that. 100% of our production and 100% of our prospects are in theGulf of Mexico with one exception, which is an investment in a shale joint venture, which I'll mention briefly later on in my talk. The other, and sort of critical part of our vision and our goals that have been since the beginning of the Company, is that commodity prices aredetermined by the market.There's nothing that -- our Mcf's and our oil is basically indistinguishable from others. And therefore, the only long-termcompetitive advantage in the oil and gas business -- or for that matter, any commodity business -- is to be the low-cost producer.That has certainlybeen our focus. I will have a slide that is worth presenting, that shows us ranked against 41 other independents. And we -- our operating costs are about half ofthe -- I'll say the industry average, although the average is really only for these 41 other independents. But these independents are companies fromChesapeake and Apache, down to companies the size -- Contango is a billion-dollar market cap company. And so these are down to our size andsome of the companies are, I think, even smaller than Contango. And then, finally, the third bullet point on my slide is that the only rationale for buying stock in any Company is the return on capital. And therefore,it's about profitability -- since return is some profit number in the enumerator, and some investment number in the denominator. You can comeup with different ways to measure profit and different ways to measure investment, but that's what return is. And our share count, we have stayed very focused -- what should we do -- where should we put the slides? Oh, we're going to -- okay. I guess it'sgoing -- the little CD is about to be inserted here. That's why we've stayed very focused on keeping our share count extremely low. Excuse me onesecond, I think the slide is going to be put in. Okay, this goes sideways -- there we go. All right. Lawyer stuff I'm going to skip that -- even though I think it's funny. This is the slide I was talking about -- I was talking about shareholder wealthper share. The whole point of business is only and always increase shareholder wealth per share. Contango is low cost.You can see this is our cost for the fiscal year that ended June 30, and it's less than $3. DD&A is $1.68. I talk about the differencesbetween full cost companies and successful efforts companies. Full cost, of course, you throw everything in to your full-cost pool. But because     We have $120 million in cash, which is about [$7.50] per share. No debt 12 wells seven prospect ideas is going to cost us about $135 million overthe next two years, and we are sitting with $120 million of cash. So it's only $85 million -- I say only, but it's -- when you have a partner for 40% ofeverything you do, which we do, the federal government takes 40% of the risk with us when we drill wells. Outstanding shares -- I'm not going -- not issuing -- haven't issued options. Not a fan of options don't want to issue any options. So, that numbercontinues to come down. If something goes crazy in Greece, and Wall Street wants to take all stocks down in a massive way for a totally unrelatedreason, and it looks like people want to just give us our stock, we'll take it. And eight employees. Yes. And I'm about to wrap up here -- I know I've got time. In golf, it's not how it's how many. And this comes back to the number of shares, thenumber of Mcfe's per share. In investing, it's not how many -- it's not how big you are on the left-hand side of the balance sheet, but how many ofthose do I own after I've adjusted? And, again, that's -- the 22 is pretty good. I'm showing where other production is coming in to replace our Dutchand Mary Rose as it depletes. And finally, there's America's Energy Company. I did that as really as a rift against the Cowboys, who I can't stand they're calling themselves America'sFootball Team. So, here's 8 people -- not exactly America's Energy Company, but there we were at Christmas having a good time. Thank you verymuch."
