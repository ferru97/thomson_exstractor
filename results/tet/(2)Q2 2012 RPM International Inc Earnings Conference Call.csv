Was there any benefit from weather, or was there pre-buying activity ahead ofannounced price increases by your customers, or could you give a little detail? How much of that percentage increase was due tonew products? What new products are you seeing a lot of momentum in?"
2,18590732,RPM INTERNATIONAL INC,01/05/2012,3:00PM,RPM,Q2 2012 RPM International Inc Earnings Conference Call,Frank Sullivan,RPM International Inc.,Chairman and CEO,False,True,False,"The unit volume growth there has been very good, about 9% in the quarter, and we're continuing to get raw material price increasesor product price increases. I'm not aware of any pre-buying, but I do know we have some additional price increases going into effectat the beginning of this calendar year. A lot of it is market share gains, both at our core retail customers, as well as pickups in somenew accounts and also some new channels.We're continuing to gain share, for instance, in the automotive sector. Some of the grossmargin issues are a mix issue, as we're picking up share in lower margin categories relative to, for instance, Rust-Oleum's historicmargins. Some of it relates, in particular, to TiO2 -- just significant ongoing raw material cost increases that are impacting the wholeindustry. But the strategy that we had coming out of the recession, we're executing. And it was really to focus on aggressive growthin all of our businesses, and we are executing on that. One other comment I would make in relationship to some of the new product introductions at our Rust-Oleum businesses and ourDAP businesses, a good example would be DAP.We just announced a whole new window, door, and sealant line into the constructionmarkets, particularly in relationship to seeing those markets bottom out. And in the process, we have incurred a significant amountof SG&A expense in terms of packaging, product introductions, and the expense associated with a new product line whose potentialover time is tens of millions of dollars of new sales, but whose P&L today looks a lot like expense and not a lot of sales because it wasjust introduced. We are focused on growth. We are focused on market share gains. And we believe, over time, that a combination of price increasesand relief in raw materials will get our margins back in line."

Looking into the third quarter, are the acquisitions that you've made in the first half of the year -- I know historically the quarterswere breakeven, plus or minus $0.05 here or there. Would you expect, due to the acquisitions contribution, to be in the black for thequarter? Or is it still, think about it breakeven, plus or minus a couple of cents?"

It'll be a hit to cost of goods sold, and also the acquisition-related costs in thattransaction. But we will call out those separate results."

Is that a change going forward that you're going to start calling that out?Or was this quarter just particularly high due to all the activity that you've had in the first half, and you just want to make peopleaware of that?"
6,18590732,RPM INTERNATIONAL INC,01/05/2012,3:00PM,RPM,Q2 2012 RPM International Inc Earnings Conference Call,Frank Sullivan,RPM International Inc.,Chairman and CEO,False,True,False,"I think the answer is yes to both. For a number of reasons, our acquisition activity kind of in the mid to late 2000s had slowed down,and we were doing mostly relatively small product lines. I think the last sizable acquisition we did was illbruck in 2005, and that wasin relationship to private equity valuation expectations, which are down dramatically, which is a good thing.We are buying businessesat our historic valuations, not the inflated valuations of 2006 to 2008. And in relation to that, changes in accounting, where five toseven years ago, all of your acquisition costs, be they legal costs, due diligence costs, or on some privately negotiated deals, brokerfees, were all capitalized. In today's world, all those costs are period expenses."

In the consumer segment going forward, even with the market share gains and the mix issues, you'd still expect to benefitfrom an improving price/cost spread. I know there's a volume issue in the third quarter, but going forward you'd expect the price/costspread to sort of improve going forward, even with the lower mix?"
8,18590732,RPM INTERNATIONAL INC,01/05/2012,3:00PM,RPM,Q2 2012 RPM International Inc Earnings Conference Call,Frank Sullivan,RPM International Inc.,Chairman and CEO,False,True,False,"That's correct. You will begin to see price/cost mix improvement really in the spring, as our third quarter is so seasonally low. It'shard to really guess at what that will be, but we have been experiencing some significant benefits in certain raw material categorieswith a FIFO accounting that will start to show up here in the coming months."

Also, if they're some of the newer ones, is it an issue of you have to discount to get the initial shelf space,and then over time we can see them go back, or is this something that could be a permanent drag on the margins going forward?"
12,18590732,RPM INTERNATIONAL INC,01/05/2012,3:00PM,RPM,Q2 2012 RPM International Inc Earnings Conference Call,Frank Sullivan,RPM International Inc.,Chairman and CEO,False,True,False,"In some cases, for instance, in automotive channels, a number of the product areas are lower margin, so that'll be permanently lowermargin. In other cases, it has been one-time lifts associated with getting into new accounts or getting new space, which won't berepeated. Then the other issue is just a continuing game of catch-up on what has been an extraordinary increase in raw materials,particularly TiO2 that has hit our industry broadly.The good news about TiO2 is it really does not impact RPM's industrial businesses.The only place that it really has an impact on us today is in our Rust-Oleum Group, a little bit in small project paints, and principallyin primers. Our primer business is a multi-$100 million business, and it is white.That white comes from TiO2, and that's been the rawmaterial that has been most frustratingly high for our Rust-Oleum Group, as well as for our industry."

One last question, you reiterated your full-year guidance that you gave back in July. And since then, you've made threeacquisitions that you say are going to be at least modestly accretive. I'm wondering what incrementally is getting worse than maybewhat you were expecting, if anything, or is it just you're taking maybe just a conservative approach?"
14,18590732,RPM INTERNATIONAL INC,01/05/2012,3:00PM,RPM,Q2 2012 RPM International Inc Earnings Conference Call,Frank Sullivan,RPM International Inc.,Chairman and CEO,False,True,False,"I don't think we're taking a conservative approach. I think what's happening is two things -- number one, our sales are better a littlebit than we anticipated, particularly in consumer, but our raw material costs are worse, up until this point, than we anticipated. Andthen, the acquisitions will most definitely help us in the fourth quarter. But on the full year, they're kind of a wash because, as youlook at $1.60 to $1.65 target in EPS, it seems like we're behind the curve. Part of that is the expensing of acquisition expenses, $3million, $3.5 million of which hit this quarter, as well as the one-time negative hit to cost of goods sold from inventory write-ups.Those acquisitions have actually hurt us now. You will see a nice benefit in the fourth quarter, which will make the fourth quarterlook good. But relative to our full-year targets, we'll essentially offset the negative impacts of the transaction costs in the period inwhich the deals were done."

We may get back to that unilaterally on our own accord, but you can only get hit over thehead by so many places as to why we're the only one providing it relative to our industrial peers, and so that's what's behind that.We are advocates of it. As you point out, we've done it in the past, but it has, in certain instances, competitively served to hurt us inour businesses, because our peer companies do not provide it, nor does the SEC require it to be provided."

Kemrock -- how much do you have invested in Kemrock? Where does it show up on the balance sheet? Thisrun rate of $600,000 of equity income, ex the one-time catch-up, is that what we should be looking for?"

The investment in Kemrock's currently about $36 million. We would hope that that would go up over time. It's an extraordinarycompany that we have partnered with in India. Seven years ago, it was a $14 million business. This year, it will do about $250 millionin sales. Our ownership interest over that period has gone from 5% to what is now 23%. I think that's correct, the ongoing benefitfrom an equity accounting is about $600,000 a quarter. We would hope, over time, that that would grow with Kemrock, both inrelationship to their growth and our growing investment."

A lot of that is at our Rust-Oleum Group, that's, over time, one of ourbetter businesses. I would expect us to catch that up by the end of the fiscal year. We've targeted about $100 million of free cashflow for the year, and I think we'll get there."

But you've consolidated 100% of their revenue and 100% of theirearnings up above. So my question --."

It's in relationship to SPHC, and the accounting for that situation is suchthat there are businesses that, for instance, as I've highlighted in the past, Day-Glo is part of SPHC, but the Day-Glo subsidiaries oroperations outside of the United States are not. And so it is a percentage of minority ownership of SPHC companies, principallyDay-Glo and Dryvit, affiliated with those two entities' foreign operations or foreign subsidiaries that are not part of the SPHC/Bondexfiling."

It could be more, and I, at this point, don't have a good sense of what that is. We've had, in general, about 3% price increasesacross both of our segments on average. Of course, that is a widely varying mix of some product categories where we have notgotten price increases, and other unique product categories where we've had price increases in double-digit ranges. But on average,it's been 3%, and on average holds about the same for each segment.There are new price increases continuing, some of which wereannounced in January."

Our Tremco sealants, in particular, is showing modest single-digit growth in sales and earnings. That's continuing,and it's principally in relationship to our broad distribution, which gets at multi-family housing, and gets at some of the smallconstruction activity that's picking up.We are benefiting from that there in our Building Solutions Group in particular, and in particular,our sealant product lines. The other area that we would expect to benefit from that in the future is this new WDS category that we have been investing forwardin, in our DAP business. It is a new product line that was just launched that is specifically targeted at the residential and light commercialmarkets. I think the timing is such that we feel that the worm has turned a little bit on those markets. There's not going to be anyhuge rebound, but we believe we've found a base at which you're starting to see modest growth. Multi-family housing in particular,in relationship to rent versus own, is an area that's starting to grow pretty nicely."

Interestingly enough, our European sales and earnings are relatively flat to last year, and we haven't lost any margin. It's acombination of the fact that our exposure in Europe is principally industrial. Our Performance Coatings Group, which is our mostglobal group and also has a big presence in Europe, is serving what is an expanding industrial capital spending and industrialmaintenance spending market pretty much across all of our product categories and channels, whether it's in energy, oil and gas,infrastructure, a lot of areas like aerospace or food service. We have a very broad presence in multiple channels, and that is the areaboth in North America and globally where we're seeing continued strength. When you look at that industrial segment growth of about 10%, and you realize that half of that is in building materials, mostly NorthAmerica that are growing 3% or 4%, it gives you a sense of the strong growth in the high performance coatings that serve theindustrial capital spending and maintenance markets in what they're doing. Secondly, our largest concentration of business in Europeis in Germany, and that's just been in part strategic, but also lucky, because that's the largest market in Europe and the one thatcontinues to show some positive momentum."

I think we're confidentthat the raw material environment and the cost/price situation that we see today is such that we ought to have some improvement.Having been through what we've been through the last two years, it does not anticipate another significant rise in major raw materialsthis spring. That's one factor. The other factor is, we have done a pretty good chunk of nice, strategic acquisitions, and year to date they have hurt our gross marginin industrial because of inventory step-ups, and they have hurt our corporate/other expense to the tune of $3.5 million or $4 million.In the fourth quarter, the one-time expenses will be gone.

Again, the raw material environment we see today makes us hopeful thatwe'll have a better second half as it relates to the cost/price impact on our gross margins.

I would think the first impacts of that would be this spring and this summer, anddepending on our distribution and penetration level, it's a very exciting product line for us. It has potential to add tens of millionsof dollars to DAP and RPM, but obviously we've got to have the right product and get broad distribution to get going.
