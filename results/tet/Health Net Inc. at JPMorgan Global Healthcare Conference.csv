I thought you said -- it's only the 30th. I mean, you know, okay. I'd like to talk a little bit about where we are, where we've come from, and kind of how we see the future. First of all, just in terms of our basicfoundation of thinking, our foundation of thinking which is -- this slide has existed for like at least a couple of years -- is that the system is alreadychanging, that everybody's all agitated over the Supreme Court and the election, and all these events, and that most of them will not be nearly asmaterial as what is already going on. And so it's really thinking through the business model and the business opportunities based on facts that arealready existent. There will be some nuances, some day trade events in the interim, but I think the trends and the direction are very obvious. So I'dlike to talk about it from that standpoint, and then kind of walk you through what we think based on that. Two key things are fundamentally changing healthcare. One is the economy. People no longer are planning on taking $50,000 a year out of theirhouse, so they actually are value shoppers in terms of healthcare. That will only intensify that won't diminish. We're going through basically afive-year period, which we basically just started, where we're moving from a revenue driven to a cost driven business. Just as simple as that. Thelast 10 years have been years of kind of a revenue orgy. They've been time when you've really been tracking the top line. That's not the future. The future is going to be about providing products at an affordable price that provide adequate coverage.That will mean dramatic transformationof every element of the system. It won't be transformation that is purely structural in fact, the structural change is less relevant. It will be, at its core,economic, which means what actually pencils, what actually works, not what actually gets regulated or structured or thought about and all of thosethings.We're already seeing it.We're seeing it, in our case, with a dramatic change in our commercial business towards an efficient network strategy,where people are really buying value, buying limits on their providers, looking at price points in a two dimensional way, benefits on the one handand network on the other, and that we're beginning a process of fundamentally attacking unit costs top to bottom in the healthcare system.That'sgoing to be exacerbated by the budget pressures at the federal and state level.     We see opportunities on the G&A front, which we think are critical to be successful on a going-forward basis. We have financial flexibility for thereasons I articulated. So I think we look forward with some excitement to what will be a very, very volatile year, and we think we are positionedwell to deal with it. Thank you."
