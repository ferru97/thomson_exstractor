Risk factors for Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS areset forth in our SEC filings, including without limitation the Form 10-K for fiscal 2010 and Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks for fiscal 2011. For the five weeks ended December 31, 2011, sales grew 14% to $1.149 billion, up from $1.008 billion in sales for the five weeks ended January 1,2011. Same-store sales for the month rose 9% on top of 4% and 12% gains in the prior two years. For the 11 months ended December 31, 2011, sales totaled $8.125 billion, a 9% increase over the $7.425 billion in sales for the 11 months endedJanuary 1, 2011. Comparable store sales for the 11 months ended December 31, 2011, grew 5% on top of a 5% and 6% increases for 2010 and 2009,respectively. We are very pleased with our much stronger-than-expected sales gains in December. These reflect results that value-seeking shoppers continueto respond favorably to the wide array of compelling name brand bargains throughout our store. Juniors and shoes were the best performing merchandise categories in December, with same-store sales well above the Company average.Geographic trends were broad-based. At the end of December, average in-store inventories were down about 6% from last year.Total consolidatedinventories were up about 10%, driven by packaway balances, which were approximately 48% of total inventories at month end compared to 47%in the prior year period. Based on our above-plan sales and favorable gross margin trends for the first two months of the quarter, and our continued assumption for a 1%to 2% increase in January same-store sales, we now project earnings per share of $0.82 to $0.83 for the 13 weeks ending January 28, 2012. Thisupdated range compares to our prior earnings guidance of $0.77 to $0.80 per share, and represents a forecasted increase of 19% to 20% over $0.69in last year's fourth quarter. All current and prior-year earnings per share have been adjusted for our recent 2-for-1 stock split. We plan to report January 2012 sales results onThursday, February 2. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director of Investor Relations, at 925.965.4289,or me at 925.965.4315. Thank you."
