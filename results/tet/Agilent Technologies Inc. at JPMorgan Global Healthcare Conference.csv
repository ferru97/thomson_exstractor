Good morning. My name is Tycho Peterson from the life science tools diagnostics team. Welcometo the 30th JPMorgan healthcare conference. I know there are a few people that have been here for all of them. So it's quite a tradition. Anyway, let me introduce our next company this morning, Agilent Technologies. And here to kick it off, I'm pleased to introduce Bill Sullivan."
1,18608992,AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES INC,01/09/2012,4:30PM,A,Agilent Technologies Inc. at JPMorgan Global Healthcare Conference,Bill Sullivan,Agilent Technologies Inc.,"President, CEO",False,True,False,"Thank you. It's a real pleasure for us to be here today to talk about our efforts in life science. As many of you know that we had started this transformation from moving from a diversified technology company to continue to leverage ourcore foundation from over seven years ago, but to continue to grow in the life science space. Before I give a brief overview regarding Agilent, I do want to share with you the Safe Harbor. Essentially, we may be making future-looking statements,and again, the Company has no obligation to follow up on any of the statements that Nick and I may make. If you look at Agilent Technologies, we're organized into three major business groups. And our fiscal-year 2011 that ended on October 31 was thebest performance in the history of the Company, the best performance since we separated from Hewlett-Packard in 1999. Our revenue at $6.6 billion was 17% organic growth rate. We are essentially an organic-growth company, other than we did make the Varianacquisition over a year ago, and again, largest in our history. We continue to make smaller bolt-on acquisitions, but essentially we're a Companythat likes to invent things. And as a result of that, the expectation should be that we should have higher-than-industry organic growth rate, andfor the second year in a road that was the case. We also hit record operating profit of 20%, and as you can see we had an outstanding performance in our Electronic Measurement Group, as wellas our Chemical Analysis group. In a moment, Nick Roelofs will speak about Life Science, and there the operating margins are obviously lower. It'sthe biggest investment that we're making. We're making huge investments in building a channel, building our R&D portfolio, and Nick will talkabout that. And finally, we ended with record EPS in 2011. In terms of our outlook, this is the outlook for Q1 and for fiscal 2012 that we presented November 15, 2001 (sic - see Website), and again we willbe making no adjustments or comments regarding that guidance today. In terms of Agilent's ability to win, the strategy over the last two years where we've had this outstanding organic growth rate remains the same.The foundation of our strategy is based on our operating model, an operating model that has resulted in very, very predictable incrementals, verystrong commitment to deliver 40% incrementals in our Electronic and Chemical Analysis and 30% profit incrementals in our Life Science business.     Clearly, the opportunity is in emerging markets. That is where Agilent has been making its largest investment not only in sales and marketing, butto support in terms of research and development. So when you look at these eight markets, it is really a mixed bag of what's going to happen. I think the companies that are going to do better inthis environment are the ones that are going to be able to navigate through this economic uncertainty. I'm sure that every CEO up here will tellyou that their company's going to do a better job of navigating that, but I believe that our four-point strategy, based on our operational discipline,will allow us to continue to do as well as one can expect in this economic environment. A couple of highlights, though, in terms of the plus side. Clearly, communications continues to be an opportunity for us. I have always said thatthe LTE rollout, G4, which right now is a U.S. phenomenon, will in fact be a secondary impact to the rollout of smartphones, 3G, into developingmarkets. Secondly, the petrochemical market is very, very exciting for us. We are very, very well positioned, I believe, with the continued focus in not onlyin alternate energy, but more importantly in fossil fuel-based energy that we are very well positioned to be able to provide the instrumentationand continue to participate in that opportunity. Obviously, aerospace and defense industry, given the situation in the U.S., which is half the market, is in question. Fortunately, we have done very,very well in aerospace and defense outside the United States and we continue to shift resources into operational surveillance. So given that it is a mixed bag, what we need to do is to make sure that we are allocating our resources to where the opportunity is. In a moment, Nick is going to talk, and I'll let him talk about the outlook for pharma and academic and research. But I will put a plug in for his teamand how well we've done in academic/government. We have enormous -- you can talk about what's going to happen in the National Institute ofHealth, what's going to happen to investment. And if you go back three years ago, academic/government life science business in this Companywas only 3% of our revenue. As you can see on the slide, today it is 8% of the revenue. And this is an example of Agilent's ability to focus on a market, to get the right people inplace with the right solutions, and we can in fact dramatically grow our position in that market irregardless of the overall economic environment.And this is a case where we have had outstanding performance across the Company, so for this segment of our business to be at 8% of our overallbusiness, I believe, is a real accomplishment to Nick and his team. So with that, what I'd like to do is turn it over to Nick and have him talk specifically about our life science effort."

Thank you for coming and attending. I'm going to take a dive into the Life Science group in Agilent, and I'll start with a little bit of a market view of the way we see this market. So wesee the life science market at about a $20 billion number. That represents a little bit less than 50% of the market opportunity for Agilent. And we see this market as being very stable, so the growth -- these are probably some of the lower growth numbers we've seen recently, in srt ofthe 3% to 6% range as a market. But we see it as stable. We see a lot more clarity in academic/government now with the fiscal year starting formany countries. And so, we're pretty optimistic about this market. So Agilent's Life Science Group, which is about 27% of the Company, sees thisas about 50% of the Company's opportunity. So there's a lot of growth upside for us as a group in taking share, et cetera. Bill mentioned academic/government we continue to invest there. This has been a focus for the team, and we see lots of opportunity in takingshare.We think academic/government is about half of this market, and that funding, while it has been battered in first-world countries, is still stable,and so we see that as real opportunity.We're putting resource into continue to invest in the channel, and I'll talk about the product side in a moment."
