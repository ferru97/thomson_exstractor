1,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Steve Cordier,Penford Corporation,"SVP, CFO, Asst. Secretary",False,True,False,"Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating on our conference call to discuss Penford's first-quarter fiscal 2012 financialresults. Joining me on the call is Tom Malkoski, President and Chief Executive Officer of Penford Corporation. Before we get started, let me caution you about any forward-looking comments we might make this morning. Any forward-looking statementsregarding future events or the financial performance of the Company are just predictions, and actual events or results may differ materially. Theseforward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. These include the performance of the economy as a whole and itsimpact on Penford's customers increased competition raw material chemical and energy costs litigation the Company's ability to access financialmarkets interest-rate changes changes in returns on pension plan assets and/or assumptions used for determining employee benefit expensesand obligations. Please refer to the documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of these and other risksand uncertainties. And finally, we do not undertake to update publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events orcircumstances after the date of this call or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. I will offer some comments on the financial results and segment operations.Tom will discuss future prospects for Penford and the pending acquisitionof Carolina Starches. Today, we reported that consolidated sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 rose 26% to $90.7 million from $72.3 million last year. Both businesssegments achieved record sales levels for the quarter. Volume gains in the Food business and Industrial Specialty Bioproducts, along with improved unit pricing in both segments, contributed to therevenue increase. Quarterly gross margin of $11.8 million expanded 28% over last year, and gross margin as a percent of sales was 13% compared with 11.9% a yearago. This improvement reflects higher revenues, an increasing contribution to growth and profitability by the Food Ingredients and IndustrialSpecialty Bioproducts businesses, as well as better processing and manufacturing fees in the Industrial division."
2,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Tom Malkoski,Penford Corporation,"President, CEO",False,True,False,"Thank you, Steve. The Company's businesses turned in a solid start to our new fiscal year in terms of revenue growth, improved profitability andnew business gains in Food and in Specialty Industrial Bioproducts. Both segments reported record revenue in the quarter, driven by volume andnew business gains, better pricing and pass-through of higher corn costs. Operating income was the best quarterly result in over three years. And I am particularly encouraged by the strong revenue gains in segments where we have strategically targeted to grow, food ingredients thatprovide functional properties and health and wellness benefits and specialty clean technology bioproducts for more sustainable industrialapplications. As Steve mentioned, both our Food business and our Industrial Bioproducts grew by more than 40% in the quarter. We are cautiously optimistic in our view on fiscal 2012. First, we are nearing completion of Industrial starch contract negotiations, and expect torealize significant improvement in pricing by the end of our second quarter versus 2011. Second, our ability to manage the wide fluctuations incommodity markets has improved, corn prices and chemical costs remain at elevated levels, and ethanol market dynamics fluctuate constantly.Improved management of these market factors should contribute to more favorable net corn costs, starch margins and ethanol fresh margins. Third, the pacing of commercial success of introducing differentiated, higher-value products and applications has accelerated, and this is animportant element of sustainable profitable growth for Penford.We've committed more resources, both investment capital for specialized equipmentand human capital, to developing technologies and applications that have a measurable impact on the performance of our customers' productsand their cost and use. We expect the strong growth in Food and Specialty Bioproducts to continue into 2012. Lastly, we have reached agreement with our bargaining unit employees at our Cedar Rapids facility to extend the current labor agreement by threeyears through July 2015. The Carolina Starches acquisition is progressing, and we plan to close the transaction shortly. We will provide more information following theclosing of this strategic acquisition. Finally, in addition to our own internal efforts to develop sustainable bioproducts, we continue to evaluate external prospects for partnering todevelop, manufacture and commercialize novel green technologies. We believe that the combination of innovative starch products, flexiblechemical and fermentation processes and our culture of selling highly-specialized bioproducts can create future business opportunities for PENX. To this end, we will soon be formally announcing a joint development agreement with Novomer in which our companies will work cooperativelytoward the creation of novel, high-performance biopolymers that are both sustainable and cost-effective. We thank you for your interest in Penford and please open the call for questions."

A couple of quick questions on ethanol. It looks like ethanol margins are likely to compressin Q2. Have you taken any measures to offset that, or could you provide a little bit more color on the comments about mitigating the volatility inethanol?"
5,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Steve Cordier,Penford Corporation,"SVP, CFO, Asst. Secretary",True,False,False,"Industry crush margins in ethanol have come down in the second quarter of our fiscal year. We had anticipated that and mentioned it on priorconference calls. Since we had looked at that coming toward us, we have taken some hedges where possible, and we expect that while the sequentialquarter-over-quarter comparison will probably dip a bit for Penford, we will probably be in a higher crush margin outcome than most of the currentmarket projections for people who are doing spot ethanol trades."
6,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Lucy Watson,Jefferies & Company,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay, and you also made a comment about the VTEC credit expiration possibly affecting demand in the near term. Since it has been a few dayssince the credit expired, have you seen any difference or fluctuation yet?"
7,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Steve Cordier,Penford Corporation,"SVP, CFO, Asst. Secretary",True,False,False,"I think most of the impact -- and those two elements are related, by the way. I think that the drop in anticipated demand is contributing to theprediction of lower crush margins in our second fiscal quarter for the marketplace. We think there is evidence of the beginning of some inventory build as production continues to run, while some of the demand is being takenfrom inventory stores, and that the supply-demand fulcrum is probably going to be tilted a little bit more towards supply for at least the 60 daysfollowing the beginning of the calendar year."
8,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Lucy Watson,Jefferies & Company,Analyst,True,False,False,Okay. And a question on liquid natural additives in your other specialty products -- how large a percent of sales are those? Is that the remaining40% that is non-coating? I guess would you be able to provide a breakdown in the Industrial Ingredients segment? And how fast are the specialtyproducts growing?
9,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Tom Malkoski,Penford Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,"Let me separate out. I think you have two topics in there.When we refer to the coatings or non-coatings, that really is our Food side of our business."
10,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Lucy Watson,Jefferies & Company,Analyst,True,False,False,Okay.
11,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Tom Malkoski,Penford Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,"And when we refer to the Specialty Bioproducts, that is in our Industrial segment, along with our starch and ethanol.     Starch and ethanol still make up the vast majority of the Industrial business on a volume and revenue basis. Combined, they would account forsomewhere near 90% of the Industrial segment. And the Specialty products would be approaching that 10% or so. The growth rate in the Specialty products has been running around 25% quarter over quarter for a number of quarters, going back the last coupleof years. The pacing on that has accelerated this quarter, we announced it was more than 40%, and we expect that we will continue to see a moreaccelerated growth than that 25% pacing that we've had in the past."
12,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Lucy Watson,Jefferies & Company,Analyst,True,False,False,"So that 40% was a sequential increase, not a year-over-year?"
13,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Tom Malkoski,Penford Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,It was year-over-year.
14,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Lucy Watson,Jefferies & Company,Analyst,True,False,False,Okay. And how are the margins on those Specialty products compared to the rest of the Industrial business?
15,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Steve Cordier,Penford Corporation,"SVP, CFO, Asst. Secretary",True,False,False,"They are significantly higher. So the contribution of the specialty bioproducts, including the liquid natural additives, is a significantly higherproportion than the volume of 10% that Tom just mentioned."
16,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Lucy Watson,Jefferies & Company,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay, and then just one question on Food Ingredients. Are you seeing customers do trials to try and formulate new product ingredients now, orare they still more focused on finding products to reduce cost?"
17,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Tom Malkoski,Penford Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,"On our side, both the health and wellness side of our Food business has seen significant interest in new products rather than cost reformulations.A lot of the basic parts of our Food Ingredients business, where I would've said that the balance was more towards cost savings opportunities inthe past couple of years, we have seen a shift, where there is a significant increase in the interest for new product news and new formulations."
18,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Lucy Watson,Jefferies & Company,Analyst,True,False,False,Thank you.

20,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Frank Rango,Purchase Capital Management,Analyst,True,False,False,"Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations. Great quarter.Two questions. Number one, Tom, I didn't catch the partnership you were talking abouttowards the end of your statements, name of your partner there."
21,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Tom Malkoski,Penford Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,"It is a joint development agreement with Novomer, N-o-v-o-m-e-r. And they are a small startup biotech. And there is a fair amount of informationavailable in the public domain about their business. But we expect to be announcing something more formally shortly. So both companies have agreed that we will hold back further comments until we get to that more public announcement."
22,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Frank Rango,Purchase Capital Management,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay. Second question, with regards to the planned expansion, I know you guys are trying to purchase some land adjacent to the Cedar Rapidsplant. What is your thinking there? What do you plan to put there if you actually secure that property?"
23,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Steve Cordier,Penford Corporation,"SVP, CFO, Asst. Secretary",True,False,False,"There are a number of opportunities that we believe that footprint can provide space to accommodate, certainly along the lines that we've talkedabout with Specialty Bioproducts and the ability for us to in a more comfortable footprint put additional opportunities for product lines. That isprobably the primary purpose. Another ancillary purpose is that it does provide us with some opportunity, which we still have to evaluate, for optimizing our internal flow ofproduct inside the plant, as well as some additional opportunities for protecting the plant from flood. That was the area along the park where wewere first encroached during the flood of 2008."
24,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Frank Rango,Purchase Capital Management,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay, got it. Other question was with regard to the Food business margins, which were obviously a record this quarter, how much of that bottomline do you think was caused from the inventory loading from the coating product that you alluded to, which I assume is the french-fry coatings?"
25,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Steve Cordier,Penford Corporation,"SVP, CFO, Asst. Secretary",True,False,False,"That's correct. I would say it was a notable part, but not a large fraction probably less than 25% of the improvement."
26,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Frank Rango,Purchase Capital Management,Analyst,True,False,False,Of the improvement -- quarter-over-quarter or year or sequentially?
27,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Tom Malkoski,Penford Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,Year-over-year.
28,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Frank Rango,Purchase Capital Management,Analyst,True,False,False,"Year-over-year. Okay. Great. And just -- if you could just help me understand a little better.You know, with the fuel credit -- with the blending creditgoing away on the ethanol, is that going to cause in the future just a $0.45 a loss of margin per gallon for ethanol? How does that work? That wasa pretty big prop under the price of ethanol. So you seem to be guiding towards lower margins, obviously, lower crush margins. But I am just trying to get a little better understanding of losingthat big prop, how is that going to affect the margins going forward more specifically?"
29,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Steve Cordier,Penford Corporation,"SVP, CFO, Asst. Secretary",True,False,False,"I believe the change in the near term is really inventory management more than anything else.The VTEC credit is applied to blenders, so it doesn'taffect producers like Penford and our peers. Those who blend ethanol with gasoline do so for a number of reasons, importantly because of theRenewable Fuel Standard, which still remains in effect, and calls for an increasing consumption of ethanol as we proceed through that program. The blender credit was helpful but not critical to that demand situation, in my opinion. But as that became an expiration threshold, a number ofpeople were rushing, as you would expect, to take advantage of the credit before it expired, and so they built up a finite amount of inventory thatnow will be drained over the next 30,60, 90 days."
30,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Frank Rango,Purchase Capital Management,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay, thanks. And one final question. Any more thoughts on doing something with the preferred stock come the April two-year anniversary, whenyou guys will be permitted to retire that or repurchase it?"
31,18608549,PENFORD CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,PENX,Q1 2012 Penford Corp Earnings Conference Call,Steve Cordier,Penford Corporation,"SVP, CFO, Asst. Secretary",True,False,False,"We have a number of choices facing us with the money that is available under our existing credit facility. We have less than $20 million drawn ona $60 million facility. The preferred stock is redeemable at par in early April 2012. The use of our liquidity will certainly reflect a number of choices between taking thatpreferred and redeeming some of that, our capital spending program, as well as the external opportunities. We are well aware that the economicimpact of the preferred stock on our reported results is significant and that will factor into those considerations."
