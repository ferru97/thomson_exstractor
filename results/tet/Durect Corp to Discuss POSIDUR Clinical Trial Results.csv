Welcome to our conference call to discuss the top-line results from BESST and our overall POSIDUR program. Sorry if therewas any confusion with the dial-in numbers, but it sounds like we have a critical mass of people on the call.This is Matt Hogan, the CFO at DURECT.This call will begin with a brief presentation by Jim Brown, our President and CEO, and then we will open it up for a Q&A session. Before beginning,I would like to remind you of our Safe Harbor statement.

2,18595662,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Jim Brown,DURECT Corporation,President & CEO,False,True,False,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone.The results in BESST trended positive for pain reduction and opioid sparing. However, they didn't reachstatistical significance for the co-primary endpoints. Although we still have more analysis to perform, POSIDUR continues to appear to be safe, andin all three cohorts, we saw a strong reduction in pain. The BESST trial provides us with additional safety information the FDA was seeking for thisprogram. In addition to being an efficacy study in older and sicker patients with larger wounds, BESST was a 300-patient study with extensive cardiacmonitoring. As a result, we have strong evidence of efficacy in our previous shoulder and hernia trials. Our plan is to combine the data from thesetwo models together with BESST, which gives us experience from a variety of abdominal surgeries to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness ofPOSIDUR in controlling post-operative pain. Our next step is completing the analysis of the BESST data and combining these results with ourprevious well-controlled studies into the integrated safety and efficacy reports that will lead to a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA. I will now reviewBESST and the results in greater detail. A review of the design of BESST -- BESST was designed to test POSIDUR in a variety of settings larger wound lengths, more serious surgical procedures,and with an older, sicker population of patients. BESST consisted of three cohorts of patients undergoing different general abdominal surgical     For next steps, there are still a lot of data from BESST that we have to analyze. Then we intend to pull together an integrated safety and efficacyreport that will tie together the entire body of work we have done with POSIDUR to date. We next plan to hold a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.We believe that this meeting can happen by mid-year.We believe the overall program shows a positive risk/benefit profile for POSIDUR and supportsan NDA submission. Although we don't have the full reports for BESST yet in hand, at this point we don't see any systemic safety issues. Bupivacaineis a well-established agent with long history of use, and it isn't a new chemical entity with a limited medical history. With respect to efficacy, we have shown in multiple models evidence of reduction in pain scores over three full days. And I do want to emphasizethe three full days, because if you look at the response of these patients and you look at whether it's on the spaghetti graphs that measure it onmultiple time points over time, or you just look at the pain scores as reported out from a statistical analysis looking out on a daily basis, this is trulya product that works on day one, on day two, on day three. We have improvement in incisional pain in our Cohort 3, when only this true pain on movement score was analyzed.We have statistically significantimprovement in pain scores in Cohorts 1 and 2 pooled, against a bupivacaine active comparator. We have a statistically significant improvementin pain scores in our earlier hernia trial, and a statistically significant improvement in our pain scores in our latest shoulder surgery model. In addition,we have shown in multiple models and studies where we have seen a numerical superiority with respect to reduction in opioid use after surgery,and in our hernia trial, this was over a threefold reduction, and with a p-value below 0.02. While we will be really pursuing an approval on the basis of pain reduction, this opiate reduction may contribute to the overall risk/benefit analysisfor POSIDUR. Our view is that this body of evidence in multiple surgical models is compelling, and may be the basis of a possible approval. Havingsaid that, we need to explore this with the FDA, which we intend to do. With that, we would now be happy to take any questions that you have."

4,18595662,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Robert Manning,,Analyst,True,False,False,"My question -- these results are obviously a little disappointing, but I have always looked at this as the icing on the Remoxy cake. Any developmentsin Remoxy since the kind of positive comments that came out of Pfizer in early November?"
5,18595662,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Jim Brown,DURECT Corporation,President & CEO,True,False,False,"Nothing new since Pfizer has made those comments, but we continue to work with them and continue to make progress. But I think I would liketo emphasize, although we are disappointed about the two co-primary endpoints, the fact is that we think there is still a nice opportunity forPOSIDUR. We have the very nice efficacy and opioid sparing results, particularly from our hernia trial, as well as our shoulder study. We have theother data that you have seen here -- the incisional pain for Cohort 3 and Cohorts 1 and 2, where we had a very nice pain signal, as well. We thinkthat, plus all of the safety information, will give us a nice opportunity for this potential NDA submission. So, although it's -- one didn't hit on thoseco-primary endpoints, it doesn't mean that this product doesn't work."

10,18595662,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Robert Manning,,Analyst,True,False,False,"Well, the results in the hernia trial were so compelling, it looked like 50 to 1 that the results weren't a result of chance.Was there any methodologicaldifference between the two trials to account for that? I think this is more than just a 50 to 1 shot against us, where -- is there -- possibly the institutionsin the first trial for some reason preselected patients? I'm just a little bit mystified by the huge difference between the two trials. And I suspectyou're mystified, too. But anything that you could say to amplify that, I'd be interested in."
11,18595662,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Jim Brown,DURECT Corporation,President & CEO,True,False,False,"Yes, I think it isn't a matter of -- if we had done a 300-patient hernia trial, I think we would have had amazing results. But what we have done is wehave done additional abdominal surgeries, different abdominal surgeries. You remember, when we -- on the basis of the shoulder and the herniatrial, our objective initially was to tell if you we couldn't submit an NDA at that point in time. But the FDA was wanting us to collect -- to kind ofpush the boundaries for this product, collect -- especially more safety information with regard to it, because we're giving 660 mg of bupivacainehere. And so, they wanted us to test these in these larger wounds, in these older, sicker patients, and that's what we have done. And so, if we just focus on the safety aspect for a minute, and I'll get back to the efficacy, we have shown no issues with regard to these. So, it waseffectively -- almost, one could call it a 300-patient QTc study.We saw no issues on the cardiovascular side or the CNS side. So, we have that in olderand sicker patients. We have nice efficacy. Then, reflecting back and looking -- excuse me, safety. Going back and looking at the efficacy now -- in these larger abdominal wounds, there's a lot more going on than there is in the hernia model. Inthe hernia model, the entirety of the wound is the hernia itself. And so, you have to cut through the muscle, you go down, you put a mesh in overwhere there was the tear.That's all sewn up. And POSIDUR is applied to all the various surfaces that were cut. And I think that's why we saw 3 timesless -- 300% less narcotics used. And it's statistically significant, obviously, and the efficacy as well. But if you are looking at these larger abdominalwounds -- in this case, these were large wounds. For example, for some of the laparotomies, they had six holes because of the laparoscopically-assistedaspect of this entire thing. And yet, if you look at the incisional pain, the pain from the wounds that were through the surface of the body, we hada statistically significant signal there. Now, it doesn't count, because of the way this trial was structured, but the data are there. And you can't arguewith that. And so, what we have, though, is additional visceral pain. So, if you had diverticulitis or colon cancer -- and unfortunately, I have friends and familymembers who have had both of those things, you end up with a visceral pain component to it all. So, it's not just the surgical wound that hurts.And that's why when we had this secondary endpoint of pain collection, where the nurses were requested by the patients to give them an opioidin order to try and control their -- whatever pain they might have outside of this incisional pain, as it were, those were the points by which we didn'treach statistical significance. That being said, in the earlier trials, the shoulder and the hernia, those points -- the opioid consumption tracked veryclosely with the incisional pain, pain on movement measures, scores that we had. These are different surgeries, obviously more complex.     There's also another component to this that I don't think will be really teased out until one gets into Phase IV work and the like, and that is -- youhave to remember, these nurses have been trained to stay ahead of patients' pain. And in the case, you might have an 85-year-old grandmotherwho has just been diagnosed with colon cancer, and she's in this trial, and that nurse is going to be compelled to make sure that she has the paincontrol that she needs. And that's a very difficult piece to control in these studies. In order to get an opiate, you had to have a pain score of at least4. This is my personal bias right now, but I believe once this product is out there and being utilized more, I think you will see a greater reduction innarcotics, even in these larger wounds, because the nurses and the doctors will learn to trust POSIDUR more over time."
12,18595662,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Robert Manning,,Analyst,True,False,False,Is there -- is one possible route just to get a limited label for shoulders and hernias? And is there enough of a market there that it would make it agood drug?
13,18595662,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Jim Brown,DURECT Corporation,President & CEO,True,False,False,"Well, I think there is certainly enough of a market around for this product entirely.The only way -- I think it's difficult, I think we have an opportunityto be able to go for general surgical pain control, because we have shown incisional pain control beautifully in BESST, and as well, obviously, inhernia and shoulder. And if one looks at [this here] as example, they used a hemorrhoid trial, which is certainly a very local thing, and bunion, whichis also a very local thing, and got a general surgical claim. And I think that was based on the strength and the body of work, as it were, frombupivacaine itself over the last 30-plus years."

The 877 number didn't work, and eventually we just kept looking at the Internet, and at that same notice, and there was a 201 numberthat was put up. So, we missed your whole presentation.

A lot of them look like they're pretty good, but theydon't meet the endpoints, because people pick the endpoints wrong."
27,18595662,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Jim Brown,DURECT Corporation,President & CEO,True,False,False,Right.

But the question is -- as you speculate, and you may not be willing to do that, about the path forward,you would expect that with the safety profile, you might have enough data to try and get a label and approval, or it probably requires another trial."
29,18595662,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Jim Brown,DURECT Corporation,President & CEO,True,False,False,"Right now, our -- and this is, you're right, this is our best guess from where we are today, is that based on the efficacy we have seen in the herniatrial and the shoulder study, combined with the -- and the safety from those trials. But combined with the overall great safety experience in thistrial, and the kind of body of evidence of efficacy, as it were -- you're right, we didn't pick the right endpoint on this trial. But nonetheless, there aresome very compelling positive results from this trial, and I can't emphasize that enough. In all -- if we look at the analyses of Cohort 1 or -- Cohort1, 2 and Cohort 3, as far as incisional pain and the overall pain experienced in Cohorts 1 and 2, we have that statistically significant motion -- result.I think that those data in BESST, efficacy and safety combined with those other trials, will -- we believe, will give us enough for an NDA. And wewon't know that until we have that pre-NDA meeting. But we plan to sit down with the Agency and discuss that."

We will be putting together what is known as an ISE, which stands for integrated summary of efficacy, and an ISS, anintegrated summary of safety. Once we have completed both of these pieces, we will then have a request for a meeting with the Agency. I thinkwe're talking a number of months to do all that. And that's why we kind of said a mid-year, because it's difficult to say how long it takes to gettogether with the Agency. Post that, if the meeting is good, then we will be submitting the NDA."

So, the positive case is, you meet with the FDA somewhere around mid-year, they say -- yes, go ahead and file the NDA. And putting thatpackage then together, given what you have already put together, is three to six months? That's a question."
