Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call.This morning I will open the call with comments aboutour third-quarter performance and give you an update on our patent litigation cases and then turn the call over to Tom Virgin, Augme's CFO, fora financial review of the quarterly results. We'll then open up the call for questions. I will ask Ivan, Eric, and Tom to address questions with me. This has been a very exciting quarter for Augme. Our combination of Augme, Hipcricket and JAGTAG has resulted in a very strong company andhigh recognition in the mobile marketplace. We have a great team in place and that experience is drawing business to us from brands, retailersand agencies. We have completed a combined industry-leading 150,000 mobile campaigns since 2004. Approximately one-third of these were done duringcalendar 2011 alone. We signed a record $6.4 million in new contracts during November and December, over $3.7 million in December alone. Wehave currently signed a backlog of over $15 million. That momentum has continued into the new calendar year. We began this year servicing more than 50 brands and have increased to approximately 300 brands as of last quarter. We currently service 15industry verticals. Our gross margin has increased from 58% in the third quarter of 2011 to 68% in the third quarter of 2012. Our revenue per client was approximately $110,000 on an annualized basis in the third quarter versus approximately $50,000 annualized in thebeginning of this fiscal year. This is over 100% increase in the last nine months. We powered nearly 16,000 campaigns in the quarter. During the quarter, we executed 136 new contracts, which breaks down as follows -- 22% or30 new customers, 57% or 78 up-sells to existing customers, 21% or 28 license renewals to existing customers. Our customer retention rate isapproximately 95%, one of the highest in the mobile marketing space. Our recurring revenues are approximately 60%. We are really excited about the Yahoo! court date coming up in the next year. We are very pleasedthat we picked up the best IP team of Goodwin Procter. We've never deviated that our IP is a very valuable. Looking forward, we have a lot of momentum generating bigger revenues from our clients. We are really excited to have completed a successfulintegration with Hipcricket and JAGTAG and now have a fully integrated sales team, selling exclusively under the Hipcricket brand in the marketplace. We are a premier end-to-end mobile marketing and advertising company in the United States. We have done more mobile marketing campaignsthan any of our competitors.We have a higher CECTM, effective cost per thousand, and produced a more robust post-click engagement with highermargins to it. In the past 18 months, we have grown from 15 employees to now over 140 employees in eight locations across the United States,nearly a tenfold increase. We are excited about our business and we've never been in a stronger position. We've accomplished a lot in a short period. The $20 million capital raise that we recently completed fully funds us to execute our growth plans and reach profitability. Today, the company isbuzzing with activity and energy. We are one company selling under the Hipcricket brand name. We are growing our business and hitting ourgoals. We completed the combination of the sales force and client service organizations under Doug Stovall, who held that same position at Hipcricketwhere he led the company's 225% revenue growth over an 18-month period. We have combined the customer-facing functionality of the Augmeand Hipcricket software as a service technology platforms into a unified horizontal platform named Hipcricket AD LIFE.This best-of-breed platformcurrently serves 15 verticals, including CPG, pharma health, retail, automotive, quick-service restaurants, financial broadcast media and entertainment,to name a few. The combination of the two platforms has resulted in a clearly differentiated offering and provides our clients with best practicesin the industry. This has created efficiencies for them by the platform's ability to scale with their needs and speed their time to market.     Another priority is to build out our enterprise OEM channel to ensure that we are properly staffed in this important area.These partnerships, Oraclebeing one example, will expand our sales reach and facilitate high margin revenue generation. And we will continue to invest in our intellectualproperty portfolio. We view our intellectual property portfolio as a critical component of Augme's overall business model. Our IP is foundational in the area of mobileand Internet marketing technology, including content targeting, device detection and advanced analytic systems. We intend to continue tovigorously defend our portfolio.We're making good progress with our partners at Goodwin Procter on litigation front and ipCapital on the licensingstrategies. In conjunction with ipCapital Group, we've developed a data-driven strategy for further targeted invention and accelerated IP development incalendar 2012. This includes a prototype database of hundreds of new Augme invention concepts. Augme's internal IP developments, the activities of which are complemented by ongoing external patent acquisitions like those we acquired withJAGTAG, the JAGTAG acquisition expanded our patent portfolio to seven patents with over 150 issued claims and 21 pending applications withover 1500 patents, pending claim. This includes three additional patents that have been filed in the last two weeks. Some of the recent developments on the IP front include, last Friday, Judge Spiro set the Yahoo! case to proceed to trial on January 7, 2013. Thiswas an event that we have been long awaiting. The US District Court of New York reactivated Augme's patented and trademark infringement caseagainst AOL, Time Warner and Platform A in December. The pretrial conference has been rescheduled for February 1. We're now waiting for the judge's response to our opposition brief regarding the AOL Dakota case. Last week the US patent office granted Augme'srequest for re-examination of Yahoo!'s patent in question. This is meaningful because we believe our patent predates Yahoo!'s. We believe that our IP portfolio, which is available for licensing, is key to commercial protection of our proprietary technology and to solidifyingour market position. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tom Virgin for a review of the third-quarter financial results."

Hi, everyone. I'll start by discussing the results for third quarter of fiscal 2012. For the third quarter which ended November 30, 2011, we reported revenue of $4.4 million, an increase of approximately 418% compared torevenue of $854,000 for the third fiscal quarter last year and an increase of 244% compared to revenue of $1.3 million for the second fiscal quarterthis year, which ended August 31, 2011. The increase in overall revenue resulted primarily from the combined revenues of Augme, Hipcricket, and JAGTAG.These acquisitions closed duringsecond quarter, Hipcricket on August 25, right at the end of the quarter, and Jagtag on July 22. Also contributing to revenue growth was increased spending by existing customers and from adding new customers.To give investors and analystsinsight into our revenue mix, starting this quarter, we will give you a breakdown of revenue into three components. These three are software as aservice revenue mobile advertising solutions revenue and the third category is other licensed mobile products. The third category includesnonrecurring revenue, such as development work for marketing campaigns and shorter-term licenses. For the third quarter, 60% of our revenue came from SaaS licenses, followed by 20% from mobile advertising solutions and 20% in the othercategory.     We also capitalized acquisition-related transaction costs for the Hipcricket and JAGTAG business acquisitions which should have been expensedas incurred. These changes result in an additional transaction expense of approximately $700,000. Turning back to the third quarter income statement, non-cash stock option warrant expense which is included in SG&A totaled $2.7 million for thequarter compared with $615,000 in the same period last year. Last quarter, these non-cash expenses totaled $2 million. We recorded a net loss of $10.5 million or $0.12 per share for the quarter compared to a net loss of $2.6 million or $0.04 per share for the sameperiod last year, and a net loss of $6.2 million or $0.09 per share for the second quarter. Besides the non-cash charges for warrants and stock optionsof $2.7 million for the quarter, we had approximately $1 million of non-cash expense related to the continued consideration and approximately$1 million in one-time costs related to the integration of the companies. As of November 30, 2011, the company's cash balance was $16.9 million.We brought in $19.5 million from the secondary offering and from proceedsfrom the exercise of stock options.We invested approximately $800,000 in patent defense costs.We used $1 million to pay off the note to Hipcricketand spent $4.2 million on operations. All of these factors resulted in an increase in cash of approximately $14 million. I'll now turn the call back over to Paul."

In closing, mobile marketing is moving up the adoption curve, as evidenced by the fact that the companies are now dedicating aseparate line item in the marketing advertising budgets to mobile. More customers like Miller Coors for one example are spending on and committingto multi-year, multimillion dollar contracts. We believe that with our superior patented technology, industry recognition, reputation for quality,reliability, and mobile marketing and advertising expertise, we are ideally suited to take full advantage of the rapid growth of the mobile marketingand advertising industry. I'd now like to open up the call for questions. Operator, please?"

Will it be 50% of revenues? Did you say it was 10% now? Will it eventually be 100% or justif you could speak on that?

I think it's going to continue to grow as we scale the business and we open up larger multichannel forms of distributionwith some of the ERP companies, for example, and others that we are discussing with."

We are going to continue to build the business the way we have it today, but to the extentwe can shift some of our SG&A away from the business and revenue share with others, that certainly is a great business model."

Just wanted to ask a couple of quick questions.Thank you for all the segment detail that you provided. Just wondering if you mightbe able to address growth by segment given that we didn't have the reporting previously. And, in line with that, just wondering if you could maybegive some thoughts on which parts of the business are growing more rapidly, which parts of the business are relatively more profitable from agross margin perspective, and what if any movement that would imply in terms of gross margin going up or staying the same over the next fewquarters? Then also just wanted to make sure I heard correctly that the normalized expense levels or SG&A going forward is that -- did you say $7.5million per quarter? Thank you."

The margins vary a little bit by business at the gross level. It's a little more in sync when you get down to the netmargin I think. We've experienced, if you've looked kind of back on the Hipcricket and Augme combined, this mobile advertising network business is growingpretty rapidly for us and so we're investing in that. The gross margin on that's a little bit lower, although as Paul mentioned, the ECTM on that being higher for us than some of the competitorsbecause of some of the back-end things we do with mobile marketing -- or mobile advertising and post-click engagement. So, we get a little bitbetter margin on that, but it's not as good as the margins on the rest of the business. But at the bottom line, it is a pretty cost-effective business.So that we expect to grow a little bit more rapidly. The margins for the rest of the business are pretty similar on this."

So just wondering maybe if you could -- just a quick follow-up in terms of maybe how many -- what percentage of the customer base youthink have you really sort of gone around to selling the new mobile ad network solution or the relatively new mobile ad network solution? Howfar along do you think you are in terms of sort of the cross sell opportunity there?
15,18608632,AUGME TECHNOLOGIES INC,01/09/2012,4:00PM,AUGT.OB,Q3 2012 Augme Technologies Inc Earnings Conference Call,Paul Arena,"Augme Technologies, Inc.","Chairman, CEO",True,False,False,"Eric, do you want to address that? I think that's under you."

Thanks for the question. So we're in the early stages now. We see -- we've seen good demand by customers across the differentverticals for that particular product, but we are just getting started as it relates to growing that penetration through our product base."

Do those targets change now that -- with the Hipcricket also being part of the SaaS model? And if I look at the --have you gotten any traction I guess on the AD LIFE side? And is any of your backlog included in that business?
19,18608632,AUGME TECHNOLOGIES INC,01/09/2012,4:00PM,AUGT.OB,Q3 2012 Augme Technologies Inc Earnings Conference Call,Paul Arena,"Augme Technologies, Inc.","Chairman, CEO",True,False,False,"Hey, Todd, thanks for joining us. You kind of cut out there in the beginning of your question. I'm not sure why. Do you remind repeating that? I'msorry."

I also want to ask about the new segmentation. In terms of the SaaS licensing, it looks like you are re-segmenting because Hipcricket --an element of their businesses -- is SaaS licensing. And I wanted to know, at this point are you -- do you have any -- you have not made anyannouncements in terms of licensing the AD LIFE platform. Are the targets for that still on track, and do they change now that the merger hasoccurred? And also do you -- would you put that business in your backlog and is there anything in your backlog really that's that?"

In fact, I happen to be at an Oracleconference out in Scottsdale as we speak. We're going to continue to build our initiatives in that area. And we think it's a very scalable, profitable piece of the business in the future. But right-- for now we're making an investment in hiring additional sales and additional client services personnel because we are seeing a dramatic growth.We did $3.7 million in new contract business just in the last month alone, which I think is indicative of the strength of the revenues that are startingto come in. Ivan, would you have anything to add to that?"

So I think you're going to see that as Tom and Paul have outlined already, every one of these categories are going to grow and they're goingto grow rapidly. And you see what's going on in the mobile ad space, and our ability to gain traction there, we are very optimistic on the kind of percentages thatthat's going to get. The SaaS model itself is growing.     And I don't know that you mentioned, Paul, that we literally just hired a stellar guy that is helping to lead their charge on the enterprise level ofwhat we're doing. And we feel very confident that that's going to start gaining some good traction even though it's a brand-new vertical for us.With what he brings to the table along with Paul driving that, we are very optimistic of the kind of numbers we're going to hit."

Based on your OpEx number of $7.5 million kind of going forward, is there any kind of be any variation to gross margin? Or ifI do kind of back-of-the-envelope math, does that assume an $11 million quarterly run rate and revenue to get to break even? I guess is my mathright on that? And then my second question would be, on your Yahoo! trial date, I know Yahoo! had counter claimed against you. Are these two cases consolidated,or is there a separate date for that case as well? Or is anything has anything been moved along on that secondary part of the case? Thanks."

I'm going to address the cash burn and then sort of back into the first part of your question because I know that the netloss of $10.5 million is a big number for last quarter. However, I want to point out that $2.7 million of that was non-cash option warrant expenserelated, approximately $1.3 million from professional fees and about $1 million of restructure charges related to the transactions from prior quarters.Did really about -- if you back out that $5 million of nonrecurring expense, approximately $5.5 million of operational net loss. We're starting to see that dissipate. We're currently at about $3.5 million, $4 million burn as we speak. The revenues are increasing faster than theexpenses, however. And I would say our quarterly break-even is probably closer to $8.5 million, $9 million at the moment. On the Yahoo! counterclaims that -- that is going to be tried separately. There has not yet been a scheduling order set forth that's going backthrough review with the US PTO, patent trademark office, at the moment and, so whereas they -- US PTO had granted Yahoo!'s request to reviewtheir claims, they also granted our request to review their claims. They had questioned one of our patents. I think we questioned four of theirs. So,that's something that is not going to stay the case if that's the question."
