1,18597077,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Robert Manning,,Analyst,False,True,False,"My question -- these results are obviously a little disappointing, but I have always looked at this as the icing on the Remoxy cake.Any developments in Remoxy since the kind of positive comments that came out of Pfizer in early November?"
2,18597077,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Jim Brown,DURECT Corporation,President & CEO,False,True,False,"Nothing new since Pfizer has made those comments, but we continue to work with them and continue to make progress. But I thinkI would like to emphasize, although we are disappointed about the two co-primary endpoints, the fact is that we think there is stilla nice opportunity for POSIDUR. We have the very nice efficacy and opioid sparing results, particularly from our hernia trial, as wellas our shoulder study.We have the other data that you have seen here -- the incisional pain for Cohort 3 and Cohorts 1 and 2, wherewe had a very nice pain signal, as well.We think that, plus all of the safety information, will give us a nice opportunity for this potentialNDA submission. So, although it's -- one didn't hit on those co-primary endpoints, it doesn't mean that this product doesn't work."

5,18597077,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Robert Manning,,Analyst,False,True,False,"I'll get back in queue. If nobody else has anything to ask, I'd just -- I have another thing, but I'll let somebody else go ahead."
6,18597077,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Jim Brown,DURECT Corporation,President & CEO,False,True,False,"Go ahead. If you want to ask a question, go ahead."
7,18597077,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Robert Manning,,Analyst,False,True,False,"Well, the results in the hernia trial were so compelling, it looked like 50 to 1 that the results weren't a result of chance. Was there anymethodological difference between the two trials to account for that? I think this is more than just a 50 to 1 shot against us, where-- is there -- possibly the institutions in the first trial for some reason preselected patients? I'm just a little bit mystified by the hugedifference between the two trials. And I suspect you're mystified, too. But anything that you could say to amplify that, I'd be interestedin."
8,18597077,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Jim Brown,DURECT Corporation,President & CEO,False,True,False,"Yes, I think it isn't a matter of -- if we had done a 300-patient hernia trial, I think we would have had amazing results. But what wehave done is we have done additional abdominal surgeries, different abdominal surgeries. You remember, when we -- on the basisof the shoulder and the hernia trial, our objective initially was to tell if you we couldn't submit an NDA at that point in time. But theFDA was wanting us to collect -- to kind of push the boundaries for this product, collect -- especially more safety information withregard to it, because we're giving 660 mg of bupivacaine here. And so, they wanted us to test these in these larger wounds, in theseolder, sicker patients, and that's what we have done. And so, if we just focus on the safety aspect for a minute, and I'll get back to the efficacy, we have shown no issues with regard tothese. So, it was effectively -- almost, one could call it a 300-patient QTc study. We saw no issues on the cardiovascular side or theCNS side. So, we have that in older and sicker patients. We have nice efficacy. Then, reflecting back and looking -- excuse me, safety. Going back and looking at the efficacy now -- in these larger abdominal wounds, there's a lot more going on than there is in thehernia model. In the hernia model, the entirety of the wound is the hernia itself. And so, you have to cut through the muscle, yougo down, you put a mesh in over where there was the tear. That's all sewn up. And POSIDUR is applied to all the various surfacesthat were cut. And I think that's why we saw 3 times less -- 300% less narcotics used. And it's statistically significant, obviously, andthe efficacy as well. But if you are looking at these larger abdominal wounds -- in this case, these were large wounds. For example,for some of the laparotomies, they had six holes because of the laparoscopically-assisted aspect of this entire thing. And yet, if youlook at the incisional pain, the pain from the wounds that were through the surface of the body, we had a statistically significantsignal there. Now, it doesn't count, because of the way this trial was structured, but the data are there. And you can't argue withthat.     And so, what we have, though, is additional visceral pain. So, if you had diverticulitis or colon cancer -- and unfortunately, I havefriends and family members who have had both of those things, you end up with a visceral pain component to it all. So, it's not justthe surgical wound that hurts. And that's why when we had this secondary endpoint of pain collection, where the nurses wererequested by the patients to give them an opioid in order to try and control their -- whatever pain they might have outside of thisincisional pain, as it were, those were the points by which we didn't reach statistical significance. That being said, in the earlier trials,the shoulder and the hernia, those points -- the opioid consumption tracked very closely with the incisional pain, pain on movementmeasures, scores that we had. These are different surgeries, obviously more complex. There's also another component to this that I don't think will be really teased out until one gets into Phase IV work and the like, andthat is -- you have to remember, these nurses have been trained to stay ahead of patients' pain. And in the case, you might have an85-year-old grandmother who has just been diagnosed with colon cancer, and she's in this trial, and that nurse is going to becompelled to make sure that she has the pain control that she needs. And that's a very difficult piece to control in these studies. Inorder to get an opiate, you had to have a pain score of at least 4. This is my personal bias right now, but I believe once this productis out there and being utilized more, I think you will see a greater reduction in narcotics, even in these larger wounds, because thenurses and the doctors will learn to trust POSIDUR more over time."
9,18597077,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Robert Manning,,Analyst,False,True,False,Is there -- is one possible route just to get a limited label for shoulders and hernias? And is there enough of a market there that itwould make it a good drug?
10,18597077,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Jim Brown,DURECT Corporation,President & CEO,False,True,False,"Well, I think there is certainly enough of a market around for this product entirely. The only way -- I think it's difficult, I think we havean opportunity to be able to go for general surgical pain control, because we have shown incisional pain control beautifully in BESST,and as well, obviously, in hernia and shoulder. And if one looks at [this here] as example, they used a hemorrhoid trial, which iscertainly a very local thing, and bunion, which is also a very local thing, and got a general surgical claim. And I think that was basedon the strength and the body of work, as it were, from bupivacaine itself over the last 30-plus years."

The 877 number didn't work, and eventually we just kept looking at the Internet, and at that same notice, and there wasa 201 number that was put up. So, we missed your whole presentation. We got in at your first question. And so, I don't have anyquestions, because I haven't listened to the presentation. We just wanted to let you know why there might be not more questions."

And we got a heads-up froman investor literally two minutes before we went on the air, and so we were able to send around a blast e-mail to everyone with anew number. But there was a lag there."

A lot of them look likethey're pretty good, but they don't meet the endpoints, because people pick the endpoints wrong."
24,18597077,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Jim Brown,DURECT Corporation,President & CEO,False,True,False,Right.
25,18597077,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Walter Schenker,Titan Capital Management,Analyst,False,True,False,"Not that you should have total flexibility. But the question is -- as you speculate, and you may not be willing to do that, about thepath forward, you would expect that with the safety profile, you might have enough data to try and get a label and approval, or itprobably requires another trial."
26,18597077,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Jim Brown,DURECT Corporation,President & CEO,False,True,False,"Right now, our -- and this is, you're right, this is our best guess from where we are today, is that based on the efficacy we have seenin the hernia trial and the shoulder study, combined with the -- and the safety from those trials. But combined with the overall greatsafety experience in this trial, and the kind of body of evidence of efficacy, as it were -- you're right, we didn't pick the right endpointon this trial. But nonetheless, there are some very compelling positive results from this trial, and I can't emphasize that enough. Inall -- if we look at the analyses of Cohort 1 or -- Cohort 1, 2 and Cohort 3, as far as incisional pain and the overall pain experienced inCohorts 1 and 2, we have that statistically significant motion -- result. I think that those data in BESST, efficacy and safety combinedwith those other trials, will -- we believe, will give us enough for an NDA. And we won't know that until we have that pre-NDA meeting.But we plan to sit down with the Agency and discuss that."

28,18597077,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Jim Brown,DURECT Corporation,President & CEO,False,True,False,"Well, it's obviously early days. We will be putting together what is known as an ISE, which stands for integrated summary of efficacy,and an ISS, an integrated summary of safety. Once we have completed both of these pieces, we will then have a request for a meetingwith the Agency. I think we're talking a number of months to do all that. And that's why we kind of said a mid-year, because it'sdifficult to say how long it takes to get together with the Agency. Post that, if the meeting is good, then we will be submitting theNDA."
29,18597077,DURECT CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,DRRX,Durect Corp to Discuss POSIDUR Clinical Trial Results,Walter Schenker,Titan Capital Management,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay. So, the positive case is, you meet with the FDA somewhere around mid-year, they say -- yes, go ahead and file the NDA. Andputting that package then together, given what you have already put together, is three to six months? That's a question."
