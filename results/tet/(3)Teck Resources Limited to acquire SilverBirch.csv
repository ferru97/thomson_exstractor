I just wanted to go over the regulatory approvals. I did see that you're expectingthis deal to close kind of mid April, so just was wondering if you could go over that timeline? I did see here that you got someshareholders to support this transaction, so maybe if you could just talk about the background and how you came to this transaction?I missed the first part of the call, so I apologize if you discussed this already."

Yes, there's 39% of the shareholders, well that's basically Management's and the two major shareholders have already lockedup to the deal.

4,18609118,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",False,True,False,"Okay, I understand that. Actually no, we've been through a long strategic process almost, actually we are pretty well 12 months now.Once SilverBirch was formed October 2010, we basically got up and running, got settled in. And then starting in January 2011, weformed an informal strategic working group of some of the members of the Board with also our financial advisors joined the teamas well. And we basically look at the strategic options for the Company, understanding the assets that we had. Now of course at thattime, we didn't have any results from our Audet drilling program, so we didn't know the scale of the opportunity. So during the firstsort of three or four months of that strategic process, we were assessing our assets and then getting to understand what we had onthe Audet property. So by sort of mid-year, we had some additional information. We had a pretty good understanding of the scale of the opportunity atAudet. We also had completion of the design basis memorandum, we had the resource update from Frontier and Equinox. Andprobably the key factor was in end of June, we had the revised capital cost estimates for the Frontier and Equinox projects. So again,with those bits of information, we were able to get a pretty good handle on the potential economics of Frontier and Equinox as wellas what the capital quantum that would be required from SilverBirch to stay in the project at 50/50. Now of course all along we had always said at SilverBirch that at some point we would look at our options for how great ourparticipation in the project would be, in the Frontier and Equinox project, and that we'd be quite open to constructive ways to reduceour interest as long as it created value for the shareholders. Now the financial advisors also conducted a confidential low-key process     of contacting potential participants who might be willing to either participate with us, buy our share, any number of the normalkind of things you would consider and that was quite extensive, it was international, but it wasn't a public process. At the same time, commencing in about the mid-summer, we also started negotiations with Teck on our partnership agreement.And that had been a long-standing commitment between both ourselves and Teck, was to form a partnership and properly paperit with a partnership agreement. Through that process, we had to examine value, both parties examine value, and we are lookingat ways to make a good agreement, having learned a lot from our participation also with Teck in the Fort Hills agreement andrecognizing that there were a few things in that agreement that hadn't worked well for a junior partner, particularly during a financialcrisis. So we wanted to come up with a similar partnership agreement but something that provided flexibility for the smaller Company,i.e. SilverBirch. And we work hard with Teck to put that kind of agreement together, and actually had something that we could putin front of our Boards, and ultimately then just two days before Christmas, Teck came back with the offer that we're looking at nowrather than proceed with the partnership approach. So really it was quite a long process, talked to either ourselves or our partners,talked to a lot of different parties over that intervening period and finally came to what we believe now is the offer we have in front--a good offer that we have in front of us now."

So I mean you know how it worksonce we mail the circular the clock starts ticking, but because we are starting SilverWillow, the circular will have a lot of informationin it about the new Company, so that will take some time. So we're still aiming sort of for that end of March/early April closingtimeframe."

We weren't-- we as SilverBirch didn't feel strongly about keeping Twin Lakes, our view onthe geological potential, is that it's probably limited but obviously that is SilverBirch's view and that's only subject to the limiteddrilling that has been done to date.Teck was interested in keeping Twin Lakes, so it was easy for us to make that swap of those lands."

It's very similar to the one that we have in place now. It's put in place to provide flexibility. The rateon it is very competitive with what we have now related to prime. And it's just put in place so that we have some flexibility goingforward because we were-- if we hadn't done this transaction, we probably would've had to raise some equity, so this gives us someflexibility to move forward with our capital spending program."

Just two questions. Just to clarify the loan facility, so the intent is that when the transactioncloses, you'll use the CAD25 million working capital funding in part to repay that facility?"
35,18609118,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",False,True,False,"Yes, but there is CAD24 million cash in SilverBirch right now. We'll also have proceeds from exercise of options, which we estimateup to now will be about CAD22 million to SilverBirch. So that actually in the time period between now and closing, by our calculations,gives us sufficient cash to meet current obligations and the first three months of drilling in 2012. So by closing, SilverBirch's workingcapital will be essentially zero. And the CAD25 million that will be contributed by Teck will go into SilverWillow. Now as Wayne said, the CAD20 million loan provides us the flexibility because obviously the proceeds from the exercise of optionswill only come in at closing, and so if there's a shortfall on cash just due to timing reasons, because drilling programs tend to bequite financially intense if you spend a lot of money in a hurry and the bills come in very quickly. So we're just assuming that theremay be a cash shortfall and that's really what the loan will be used for so that in theory by closing, we should have most of the CAD25million intact once we start at SilverWillow."

And just a question on the timing. SilverWillow is being listed, do you expect that it'll-- that it'slisting will be coincident with the closing of the transaction? Or is it possible we might see the plan of arrangement close and thena few weeks later the SilverWillow start to trade?"

Are the Twin Lakes areas an area that was contemplated potentially as a gift to the provincefor environmental park or recreation area?
45,18609118,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",False,True,False,"Well that's an interesting idea. There's been discussion of that kind of thing from time to time but nothing ever followed up on. Ithink there is actually -- if you look at it John, all that SilverBirch and Teck had on there was the oil sands leases, we don't have anyrights to the surface. But how Teck will make use of this land obviously is a question for Teck."

50,18609118,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,John Tumazos,John Tumazos Very Independent Research,Analyst,False,True,False,"The apparent price in terms of cash, I'm calculating is the 435 cash plus the CAD25 million working capital or 460 divided by 1.4billion barrels, or CAD0.33 a barrel. And that's less than the CAD2 apparent price at the time at a lower oil price for the 20% of FortHills sold to Total. Now admittedly it's not exactly apples and oranges, because the degree of engineering and permitting andpreliminary construction isn't the same, but could you talk to the six-fold difference in valuation and why you're embracing sellingFrontier Equinox at one-sixth of the terms or even if you made an adjustment for the difference in phase one-third of the terms?"
51,18609118,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",False,True,False,"Yes. No, I think that one's one we could certainly respond to. If you look, we-- the number we use is about CAD0.34 a barrel, so agreewith your calculation, we come to the number slightly differently, but it's essentially CAD0.34 a barrel. This-- if you think of Frontierand Equinox, it's very early stage, we don't have any regulatory approval at this pace, at this point. We've literally just submitted theapplication, or a least Teck had, at the end of the year last year. And where as Fort Hills had had regulatory approval in place by thetime we exited that project eight years, and CAD2.8 billion had been spent by the partners. In addition, UTS had an earn in right sothere was additional value in Fort Hills from the earn in. So when you compare the metrics, it is quite a different transaction. Also keep in mind that Frontier and Equinox will not commenceproduction until about 2020 or 2021. And the issue that was facing SilverBirch that even prior to sanction, the partnership wouldhave to spend CAD300 million to CAD500 million just to get to sanction, so that's over the next three to four years. And we recognizedthat for us, that would be quite dilutive with the equity we would raise, be quite dilutive for SilverBirch shareholders and that theoffer finally made by Teck seemed to be quite fair and quite reasonable and that was why we made that decision to proceed."
52,18609118,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,John Tumazos,John Tumazos Very Independent Research,Analyst,False,True,False,"If I could be so tedious with one more question.The calculation of CAD0.34 a barrel is only the cash consideration.There is the muchmore difficult question of valuing the in situ assets or in situ potential assets that Teck is swapping with you in addition to the cashconsideration. Did you assess only the cash consideration in avoidance of dilution or did you assign value to the in situ assets werethe documentation and the potential recovery rates, the existence of the bitumen and recover ability of the bitumen require I guessa greater standard of documentation because they're deeper et cetera?"
53,18609118,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",False,True,False,"Of course the potential value of the lands played into our consideration. Because obviously we are quite optimistic about the potentialof both Audet and Birch Mountains. As far as formally assigning value, we basically for our own the calculation purposes just use thebook values which provides quite a modest amount of value. I believe by closing our book value in those various properties will be     about CAD90 million. So a little over, what's that CAD1.80 a share roughly for the book value going into SilverWillow. Now obviouslyhow the market values that we'll get to see in the next few days, but so it was in our calculations from the point of view of establishingtotal value. But as far as the metrics we've referenced, we've only referenced the cash component, John."

And then I just thought I'd ask, I'm not sure what you can comment on it on, but you mentioned potentially otherrecovery techniques at Audet should the cap rock not prove sufficient, can you talk about what you're thinking there?"

And I think aswe've mentioned in previous calls, that we did have-- we did find some pretty extensive occurrences of what we believe will be asuitable cap rock material. But what we don't know is how extensive. So our opening position is if we can prove up this cap rockmaterials existence in a big enough area and the modeling and the testing and the many frac tests show that it's sufficient forconventional SAGD, and I wouldn't call it a low pressure, I'd call it sort of a moderate pressure SAGD, then that's basically a conventionalapproach. So that if we find that that wouldn't necessarily be technically feasible, we would then look at other SAGD related approaches maybewith solvent assist or low pressure SAGD as is being tried out in other places. And then a further fallback would be some of the newtechniques that some of the other companies have been talking about, perhaps with some of the electrical or other solvent assisttype techniques. But certainly our focus will for Audet be on conventional SAGD as the first case."

And have you been in touch with the regulator on what I guess their current thinking is about cap rock and I'm not sure ifthere is any -- if they're getting any more stringent with regards to testing over the past couple of years on that, but just commenton that?"

So we are reasonably aware from theconsultants of the regulatory requirements. We recognize that there is a bit of a work in progress on how that will evolve over thenext 12 to 24 months. But we're certainly taking an approach that is relatively conservative as we consider what the operatingpressures would be as we do in the current modeling. And of course the current modeling is really just an early scoping study justto try and understand what the potential will be, there'll be further rounds of engineering once we have the many frac tests, the restof the data from the geotechnical program and of course more resource data."
