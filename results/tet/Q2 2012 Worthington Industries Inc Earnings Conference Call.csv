We appreciate your joining us today.     Now as you read in our release this morning, I am very pleased with our results this quarter. We have consistently said, coming out of the 2008recession, our expectation was to produce incremental increases on a year-over-year basis. Our second quarter contributed nicely to that expectation. In last quarter's call, I opened referring to a significant shift in our business platform that would result in a transitional gap in revenue and increasedcorporate burden for the remaining companies. This quarter that revenue gap almost closed completely on a year-over-year basis, and goingforward, with the addition of Angus, the revenue gap is more than replaced and the corporate burden will approximate the previous levels incylinders of steel by year-end. Andy will discuss that further. Our two focal points to drive shareholder value will remain the same -- to decrease the volatility of our earnings, or said a better way, to increasethe consistency and stability of our earnings while increasing our overall operating margins. We have made and will continue to make progresstoward these goals, both in how we operate and in our acquisition strategy. Angus is a very welcome addition you'll hear more about that as welltoday. At this point, and going to turn the call over to Andy and George for more detail on the quarter."
3,18590821,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Andy Rose,Worthington Industries,VP and Chief Financial Officer,False,True,False,"Thanks, John. Happy new year, everyone. As you review our financial performance for the quarter and the balance of fiscal 2012, please keep inmind that we are a company undergoing transformation. The goals of this process are simple -- higher margins and free cash flow and morepredictable and higher earnings for our shareholders. To accomplish our goals, we are both changing the way we manage our businesses and changing the mix of our businesses. Evidence of ourprogress is visible in recent quarters. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we took two businesses, [Gerstenslager] and Dietrich Metal Framing, and formed two joint ventures to make themstronger and more profitable. This resulted in the movement of businesses that were generating over $400 million in revenue from our operatingincome to equity income from affiliates. The good news is that this decision appears to have benefited both businesses by making them moreprofitable. However, the resulting corporate overhead allocations from these businesses were redistributed principally to our steel and cylinderssegments, making those segments look somewhat less profitable than they would have otherwise been over the past few quarters. We've also been active in acquiring new businesses -- Bernz in July, STAKO in September, Coleman and Angus in December.This comes with upfrontcosts and requires resources to integrate and realize the full financial benefits. Many of these costs are one time in nature but also serve to reducethe profitability of business segments on a temporary basis. We've also been investing in a few Greenfield businesses, principally through our global construction group, whose operations are included in ourOther segment. We are actively pursuing some large opportunities, much larger than our recent Mozambique project, and we'll continue on thispath to let these opportunities play out. Until then, the upfront investment will exceed the income being generated, and as a result, dampensWorthington's overall performance. We do not intend for these Greenfield businesses to lose money for an extended period of time, but believethe investment today will pay dividends in the future. Unfortunately, during the transition period, as businesses are moved in and out, and reinvestment and reengineering occurs, the true impact ofthe changes in our profitability are difficult to isolate.We will do our best to provide some visibility, but the benefits will only become fully apparentin future reporting periods as results unfold. Now, onto the quarter's results. Despite the slow growth economy, the Company performed reasonably well during the second quarter of fiscal2012. Earnings per share before restructuring of $0.28 were up 47% compared to the prior year. Results included inventory holding losses fromthe decline in steel prices, estimated at $0.09 per share. Inventory holding losses in the prior-year quarter were about $0.11 per share, about onethird of which was attributable to the metal framing business, which is no longer a consolidated entity.     I will now pass the call on to George Stoe, who will discuss operations."

Our steel processing business has experienced the normal year-end slowdown in shipments, but we have seen bookings continue into calendar2012 increasing sharply. Several price increases have been initiated from the mills, and there seems to be growing strength in the backlogs for thecoming months. Our inventories and service levels are the best they have ever been. We are currently operating with 57 days of inventory whilestill achieving a 95% on-time delivery performance. There is some concern in the marketplace about the situation about the situation with RG Steel. From our perspective, we had a careful andthoughtful plan that we had in place for several months, with alternative supply options. Regardless of the outcome, we will not be adverselyaffected, since we had backup supply plans for all of the business that we had with them. Our cylinders business is experiencing normal seasonal demand within most product lines. We're actively engaged in the integration process atour new high-pressure cylinders facility in Poland, and our 16-ounce camping cylinder facility in Kansas. We're enthusiastic about both, as Polandadds to our growing position within the alternative fuel segment, and the acquisition of the 16 ounce cylinder facility in Kansas will enable us tobetter serve the rapidly expanding customer base for this product line while continuing under a licensing agreement to produce this productunder the iconic Coleman brand. As many of you know, we also added the BernzOmatic business into the Worthington fold last year. That integration is going well, and we fullyanticipate meeting or exceeding the projections we made when we acquired the business. We recently asked our centers of excellence to begin the transformation process that was so successful in our steel processing business throughoutour cylinders organization.That process is only a few months into its work, and we have already identified opportunities for production efficienciesand cost savings. Our newest acquisition of Angus is a perfect fit for our long-term strategy of acquiring businesses that improve our margins and profitability andare complementary to our core strengths of value-added manufacturing in market leading businesses. During our due diligence process, we met with several of the key customers and came away from that with a deep appreciation for the capabilitiesand market reputation.We met with the employees at all four locations this week and are comfortable that the integration process will be smoothand seamless. We are pleased that the professional and experienced management team we acquired as a result of this acquisition is committedto continuing in their roles.The top four executives have taken a significant portion of the funds they received in Worthington stock to demonstratetheir commitment to this endeavor. The workforce appears to be equally dedicated and enthusiastic about the path forward. Our joint ventures continue to perform at a very high level.WAVE continues with outstanding results in spite of the challenges facing the commercialconstruction market.Their percentage of remodeling work is higher than in the past and has helped to maintain their marketplace strength as newcommercial construction remains weak. The ClarkDietrich JV just finished an outstanding 2011. The consolidation of the two businesses has been completed, and the cost savings weanticipated have exceeded our expectations. Almost all of the non-contributed facilities and assets that Worthington retained have now been soldor are under contract to be sold. Our realizations from these transactions have also exceeded the expectations we originally modeled when weformed the JV. Serviacero continues to grow and expand their presence in the rapidly developing Mexican market for flat rolled steel. Our new pickling there inMonterey is on schedule to be operational by July.     We look forward to calendar 2012 with great anticipation. We have a number of new businesses that we are integrating into the Worthingtonfamily. We believe all of these will continue with our objectives and improving margins, decreasing volatility, increasing our shareholders' value. I will now turn the call back to John McConnell for his closing comments."

Also, in addition to that, where hasits historical revenue been and EBITDA margins throughout the peak trough and kind of average throughout the cycle?"

The second question -- in terms of their margins through the cycle-- it is a high variable cost business, and they've done a terrific job, actually,through the cycle at maintaining margins. In fact, I think if you look back over the past several years, they've maintained double-digit margins."

And if I could, one other question. Can you provide an update on your European cylinders business? How that contributed to earningsthrough the past quarter here, and where you see the activity and volumes trending in upcoming quarters here going forward?"

It is nowhere near back where it was during the peak, whichis probably four-ish years ago in terms of its earnings, but the recovery does continue in that business."

You may recall we have started the transformation process there our Centers of Excellence teamshave been through one facility. They are just kicking off the second facility. Charges related -- most of the restructuring charges to date have beenfor outside consulting that we brought in. Those charges will be declining starting this quarter.

Great quarter. I had -- I guess I had a question about your Other segment. It sounds like you said that upfront investments right now arehurting earnings there. How long do you expect that to continue? And can you elaborate a little bit on the opportunities that you're pursuingthere?
26,18590821,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,John McConnell,Worthington Industries,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,True,False,False,"Nate -- and thank you for your earlier comment. Think of the investment is really -- as you know, we've done a project abroad in Mozambique verysuccessfully, and we had this operating in North America prior to moving to international. So this is really keeping in place the infrastructure thatallows us to do the engineering, to do the work that puts us in position to do these projects. We have, as Andy said, some very large opportunities, significantly larger than Mozambique, that will be difficult to put a timeframe on them. Theyare government-involved, as was Mozambique, and so we'll see how they come to fruition. If they start to lose traction, whatever timeframe thatis, and I would suspect we'll know this someplace in a six to nine-month period, probably sooner, but I'm not sure.Then we will have to make somejudgments. But until then, as long as these opportunities appear like they're going to get traction, it is worthwhile leaving the infrastructure inplace so that we're able to do the work."

First I wanted to ask a little bit on automotive. I think you guys have a pretty good view on what's going on there. It seemslike the sentiment is getting a little bit better across the channel. I'm just wondering what you guys are seeing? I guess if you could talk a little bitmore specifically, going into the next couple of months?."

As George pointed out, overall steel bookings are up. I couldn't go to it by segment, but we alltrack it here in different ways, and every way we track it shows forward bookings strengthening quite a bit, particularly when I look on a year-over-yearbasis. They're much stronger than they were at this time last year coming out of December. So that's very encouraging. I don't know if George hasany more color on automotive specifically for you or not."

I think that we're seeing stronger bookings that we have over the past few months, and certainlygoing into calendar 2012, we've seen a sharp increase in bookings coming from the automotive sector."

I do think it is going tocontinue to improve, and I think in this -- the way everything is right now, the way -- is why we always work like we're going to do -- our goal is toincrease, year over year, our earnings and keep driving things forward. And I think we are continuing to incrementally do this. That is a good sign. You have people worried about what Europe could trigger here in theUS, and those kind of issues are still going on. And until they calm down, it is going to be very difficult for somebody to get really robust in theirpredictions for you."

I think some of the mills out there locked into putting additional increase on as a result of that, because they sawthat their backlogs were filling as a result of the uncertainty about that. But, I can't make a prediction on where the prices will go. I think there aretoo many factors that weigh in on that. Obviously, we've seen a number of increases over the last few months."

They largely focused their efforts on smaller structures, single-family homesand that kind of things. So we didn't see them that much.

They typically are sourcing those from other third parties. But there is anopportunity -- one of the opportunities for Angus is to continue to insource the manufacturing of other parts, obviously the metal components,which they have a great deal of expertise would make the most sense, but electronics is not out of the question down the road."

I mentioned in my comments, we had a careful plan in place as our business was growing somewhat with them, but we alwayshad a thought in our mind that we had to make sure that we were cautious in going forward with that, and we're hopeful that they're going to beable to come out of the current challenges they are facing.They've been a good supplier for us in the time that we have been doing business withthem.

A couple of quick questions. I read that China has a goal of building 45 million housing units in five years. I was wondering if Worthingtonis going to participate in that? And I had a very nice visit in Mozambique in October to an 80-foot-thick met coal seam of Vallet, and I was wondering if you could talk a little bitmore about your opportunity -- the business you did in Mozambique."

But certainly all of -- eight story --actually, six-story structures will come up in our building methodologies there. Some of that will be housing. Beyond that we will continue to look for projects. I think the housing market in China is a little unsettled at the moment. So the Ministry, I think,has, I'm guessing, the motivation to hurry up on this lower-end housing to try to add stability to the housing market. Because as I would understandit, that is one of the things that is putting uncertainty into buying homes, whether or not prices will go down or not. So the sooner they get thisfloor of low-end housing out there and set up, I think they would expect to see stability come to the rest of the housing market. So they should bemotivated to do so, and we expect to participate in some. Now, with Mozambique, John, you said you were just there for something which I'm not sure I understood."

Good afternoon. A couple of quick questions. I think you mentioned regarding steel processing that for this quarter, inventory holdinglosses were roughly $0.09. Is it fair to say that we should expect this to reverse in the next quarter, given where steel prices have moved?"

I would say we've reached the -- assuming steel prices continue tomigrate up, we've reached the inflection point, and that inflection point will occur sometime during the quarter to where we will start having gains.In terms of whether or not we have losses or gains for the third quarter, I would say it is unclear at this point.You need to ultimately figure out whatthe sales for the quarter are going to be, and that will unfold over the next couple of months."

Then, back to the cylinders business, Andy, I think you had mentioned that Europe was recovering. And I was just curious, what sort oftrajectory is Europe on compared to, call it the US or the rest of the world? Can you give us some color on -- at least at this point, with the acquisitionsyou've made, how big a percentage of your mix Europe will be?"

I guess it sounds strange to say that Europe is recovering, considering you pick up the newspaper or watch the news and listen to what's goingon. But you have to remember, our European cylinder business was off almost 70% in terms of the volumes during the downturn. And so as that business has recovered over the last 18 months, it's returned to profitability and continues to migrate upward. I would say -- youheard me mention, also, it's nowhere near back to the level of profitability that it was three or four years -- four years ago, I guess at this point. In terms of the strength of the European economy, obviously we're not economists, but I think there's a lot of uncertainty there. So in terms ofwhere it goes from here, your guess is probably as good as mine."

So there will be some fees in there related to due diligenceand other, but there was specifically in this quarter, Q2, just over $1 million in fees which I would characterize as one-time. One was for an investment     banker in Europe related to the STAKO acquisition, and the second fee was related to that transaction sort of a transfer tax, if you will.

For Angus, I wanted to touch back again on the revenues. You'd reported in the release it was a little over$200 million for 2011. Where would that have been in the cycle for the Company? Is this, like, a midcycle top-line number, or where do you see it?"

Ag and mining have been very strong. Construction has been more modest, andso two of the segments, I would say, maybe are nearer the top end of the cycle, but the construction segment certainly is not and happens to bethe largest."

Clearly, things that we know over time, we'll probably be looking at migrating theminto the shared services that we do amongst all of our businesses around accounting, finance, payables, that kind of thing. Again we're not goingto be in a rush to do that. We want to get to know their employees better, and how we're going to go about it. So we really didn't bake any in, andwe're going to be out looking for ways, as our Center of Excellence team goes in there to perform the integration. One of the primary objectivesis to identify the areas of synergy when we go in, but we did not base the acquisition on that. Therefore I can't give you a number."

My synergy question has just been asked. The follow-up question on your share buybacks, given that you've put some moneyinto buying Angus. Should we think of share buybacks, maybe fewer share buybacks in the next few quarters given what you're doing with cashfor Angus?"

One is the current price one is our leverage level, which obviously is elevated at this point. We thinkabout our investment grade credit rating, and we like to maintain that if at all possible. It doesn't mean we wouldn't push the envelope there, butI think for the time being, we're certainly at an elevated leverage level. So the goal would be to delever, I think, at least in the short run."
