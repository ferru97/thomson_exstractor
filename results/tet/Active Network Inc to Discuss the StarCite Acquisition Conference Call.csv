2,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Dave Alberga,Active Network Inc,CEO,False,True,False,"Thanks, Brinlea, Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We're very excited to announce that we've acquired StarCite, a leader inthe global corporate strategic meetings management space. In addition to it's global customer base and leading strategic management -- meetingsmanagement software-as-a-service technology, StarCite provides Active Network's customers access to a vast access online marketplace of thetop hotels, destinations and venue suppliers world-wide. The combination of StarCite and Active Network delivers three critical advantages thatare unmatched by any other offering. First, we now have the most robust end-to-end technology platform that scales to address events and meetings of all sizes, from large externallyfocused events like Oracle Open World to smaller employee meetings. Second, only Active Network has the leading attendee managementfunctionality, coupled with the most sophisticated strategic meetings management capabilities for our customers. And finally, we have the largestfootprint in the business events market, building upon Active Network's current leadership position. This acquisition puts us in position to more effectively manage costs for procurement and logistics departments, while at the same time using ourexisting solutions to engage event attendees more deeply, and as a result drive additional revenue for sales and marking departments. Thisacquisition is a key step we are taking to evolve the events industry, from one that focuses on meetings logistics and spend management, to onethat includes continuous community engagement, enabling organizations to build lifetime value with their customers and employees. With a single technology suite we power customers of all sizes, including small and medium size businesses, enterprise corporations, associations,trade shows and expos, for their entire event management needs. Combined, our customers now include 10 of the largest 15 financial servicesinstitutions, 10 of the largest 15 technology corporations, nine of the largest 15 pharmaceutical companies, and over 1,000 associations. The factthat we now provide the most comprehensive technology solution, and that we have limited customer overlap gives us significant opportunityfor cross-selling our technology solutions. With that, I will turn the call over to Scott to discuss the financial terms of the deal."
3,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Scott Mendel,Active Network Inc,CFO,False,True,False,"Hello, everyone, and thanks for listening in. I would like to echo Dave's sentiment, and say that we're very excited about our acquisition of StarCite.As we stated on previous calls, we're focusing on leveraging acquisitions to accelerate the natural progression of our solutions into our currentcustomer groups. And we believe that the StarCite acquisition is consistent with that growth strategy. We purchased StarCite for $57.7 million, $40million of it in cash, and 1.35 million shares valued at $17.7 million. Additionally, there's potential for 150,000 shares of contingent consideration.This implies a purchase price of approximately 1.2 times the 2012 pro forma revenue, and 9.7 times the 2012 EBITDA, after the impact of purchaseaccounting reduction on deferred revenue. Now we'd like to provide with you some of the key variables for modeling purposes. We estimate additional revenue of $35 million to $37 millionin 2012, assuming a purchase accounting deferred revenue haircut of approximately $10 million to 12 million. We anticipate EBITDA of negative$5 million to negative $6 million in 2012, driven mainly by this purchase accounting deferred revenue haircut. This also includes integration costsof approximately $2 million in the 2012 time frame. Historically, we have seen intangibles of approximately 40% of the purchase price, and typicalamortization periods for an acquisition like this are three to five years. We anticipate the revenue will be a 50/50 split between registration and other technology revenue. Historically, StarCite has had approximately2.5 million registrations per year.We expect the StarCite acquisition to be accretive beyond 2012, and we expect future revenue growth to be equalto or greater than our existing businesses. With that, I will turn the call over to Dave for a few closing comments. And then we'll conduct Q&A."
4,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Dave Alberga,Active Network Inc,CEO,False,True,False,"I will just reiterate our excitement around the acquisition of StarCite, which is a powerful complement to Active Network's attendee managementsolutions.We see very exciting opportunities within the business events customer vertical, and believe StarCite, in combination with Active Network,provides an unbeatable end-to-end technology solution. We continue to execute on our strategic goals, and look forward to sharing our fourthquarter results on our fiscal 2011 earnings call. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to conduct Q&A."
5,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Operator,NA,NA,True,False,False,Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with Citi. Please proceed.
6,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Rohit Kulkarni,Citigroup,Analyst,True,False,False,"Hi, this is Rohit filling in for Mark. I'm so sorry, I joined a couple minutes late. Can you please elaborate or recap the time frame for the integrationof StarCite with Active Network technology? Do you have any plans to do that? Within the guidance that you give, to what extent does profitabilityof StarCite is included in that, plus just any new or additional costs that you layer onto the model?"
7,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Dave Alberga,Active Network Inc,CEO,True,False,False,"Yes. So in terms of the time frame, we're actually not prepared to give you a time frame for that right now, but we do plan to integrate this in withthe product.The attendee management functionality that we have with our existing products will slot in very nicely with what they have, in termsof their strategic meetings management piece, and also their vendor relationship piece of technology. And we'll be looking to put those togetherrather seamlessly as we move forward. And we'll get back to you with kind of a more precise time line after we have a little more time to dig intothis and make sure we can give you better dates on that. In terms of additional costs associated with that process, we really don't believe there are going to be any above and beyond costs associated withthat process. It is more so going to be, just part of the ongoing development efforts of the team. And in fact, there are people associated with thatparticular project already within StarCite, in terms of bringing attendee management up. And they will be able to focus primarily on the integrationefforts for us. So we think that, that's going to work out well for us from a cost standpoint."
8,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Scott Mendel,Active Network Inc,CFO,True,False,False,"And, Rohit, Scott here. I would just reiterate, the impact on long-term model is really the two things that I have called out. Number one, is thepurchase accounting impact of the deferred revenue, so that's about $10 million to $12 million impact in 2012. We do have the $2 million or so ofintegration costs in 2012. Then, obviously, the non-cash items going forward would impact our GAAP income projections. It's probably moved itout another 18 months or so."
9,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Operator,NA,NA,True,False,False,And our next question will come from the line of Brian Pitz with UBS. Please proceed.
10,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Brian Pitz,UBS,Analyst,True,False,False,"Thanks. Congratulations on the acquisition. Sounds like a really great asset. With the launch of the Business Solutions division, as you mentionedin the release, does this suggest that this acquisition is adding a new vertical for you, and/or is there any increase in the $10 billion-plus TAM thatyou've discussed? And then I have a quick follow-up."
11,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Matt Landa,Active Network Inc,President,True,False,False,"Yes. So I wouldn't call it new vertical. Right? I think this is just kind of a natural extension of solutions into our existing customer base, if you will.But what it does do, is it does increase our TAM, as we look at the opportunity. Right? So in terms of how we think about this, the idea of meetingsmanagement and the spend associated with that for corporate meetings over time, is at issue very large. Right? If you look at it on an annual basis,you are looking at about $350 billion that gets spent by corporations around the world on this segment. We are looking at being able to address somewhere around 1% additional of that spend with this solution, as we look forward. So you think of thisas kind of a total available market as something around $3.5 billion. So when you think about it, yes, this actually does expand our market. It'sactually is a pretty big market opportunity for us going forward, and we feel really good about the fact that now we have a real complete end-to-endsolution for the customer base."
12,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Dave Alberga,Active Network Inc,CEO,True,False,False,"Brian, I would add -- it's Alberga. I would add that what's interesting about it maybe, for us, we felt like it had the best of both worlds in that, we'renot going to a new customer set. We certainly expand our customer base with it, but we have lots of experience calling on this customer set. Andso, it's not a new vertical from that perspective. It is really just an expansion of our services to the same verticals in which we've operated before."
13,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Brian Pitz,UBS,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay. And then I guess my follow-up, from a build versus buy perspective, is this something -- did you buy it more for the asset and the technology,or more for the customer base? Because it sounds like they have a pretty good entree. You mentioned some of the customers are the same, butare you really buying additional technology here, that's going to be folded into your existing platform? Maybe can you just us give a little color?"
14,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Dave Alberga,Active Network Inc,CEO,True,False,False,"The answer is -- the answer is both. We're going to retain their technology platform. It's very good technology. It would have taken us a very bigeffort to build the level of functionality that they've built over the years. And the second piece is, obviously, the fact that, that comes along with amuch broader expanded customer base that is not already necessarily using our attendee management software. That's a very nice complement."
15,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Matt Landa,Active Network Inc,President,True,False,False,"Yes, and some of the customers -- this is Matt -- some of the customers that we're adding like Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan,Microsoft, Apple, Pfizer, J&J, GlaxoSmithKline, they are some great customers that we're adding. And the fact that these are not existing customers,right? So most of these, the vast majority are complementary or additional new customer opportunities for us -- kind of, really heightens the interestfrom that customer base standpoint as well."
16,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Dave Alberga,Active Network Inc,CEO,True,False,False,"But it's definitely not a, bring their customer base on and kind of throw away the technology, and roll our own technology out. That's not it. We'regoing to integrate the technologies. They have very good technology. And so from both factors, it's a really good move for us. Both sides of it."
17,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Brian Pitz,UBS,Analyst,True,False,False,Great. Thanks for the color.
18,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Dave Alberga,Active Network Inc,CEO,True,False,False,Yes.
19,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Operator,NA,NA,True,False,False,And our next question will come from the line of Nathaniel Schindler with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
20,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Nathaniel Schindler,BofA Merrill Lynch,Analyst,True,False,False,"Two questions. One, just how their model has traditionally been done on a -- has it been paid on a per registration basis? I know you said they doabout 2.5 million registrations a year, but I wanted to know if they were ever actually paid that way, or whether that's just an artifact of the system?Additionally, are there any modules that you -- that come with StarCite that you can leverage outside of the business vertical into some of yourother verticals? Or is this going to be really tied into expanding deeper into the business vertical?"
21,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Matt Landa,Active Network Inc,President,True,False,False,"Yes. So I think from a standpoint of revenue, right? So I think primarily what they've done in the past, they've done in the past is a subscription-basedSaaS model. Right? So they're kind of going down that, so most of the revenue is based on that. Now, they actually will do it based on the numberof registrations and dollars spend, and they'll come up with that equation based on that, but it's actually a subscription model for SaaS. Right? Sothat's what that other revenue category is. Having said that, the movement now is potentially towards this registration model, if you will, this persign-up model, if you will, and something that we'll be continuing to push. And I think that you will see continued growth in both sides of theequation, both on a subscription SaaS-based revenue, and then also on the registration going forward.The second question was, sorry, the secondquestion was -- Nat, what was the second question again?"
22,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Nathaniel Schindler,BofA Merrill Lynch,Analyst,True,False,False,I was wondering if there were any modules that were useful outside of the business vertical?
23,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Matt Landa,Active Network Inc,President,True,False,False,"Yes. So we've chosen not to talk a ton about that, but my belief is that -- that this -- the ability to essentially to create this marketplace for suppliersfor this space is very applicable in our other verticals as well."
24,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Nathaniel Schindler,BofA Merrill Lynch,Analyst,True,False,False,Okay. Would it be something like suppliers for hotel and lodging and the like in -- an Ironman Triathlon?
25,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Matt Landa,Active Network Inc,President,True,False,False,Sure.
26,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Dave Alberga,Active Network Inc,CEO,True,False,False,Yes.
27,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Matt Landa,Active Network Inc,President,True,False,False,Sure. Yes.
28,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Operator,NA,NA,True,False,False,And our next question will come from the line of Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. Please proceed.
29,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Aaron Kessler,Raymond James,Analyst,True,False,False,"Yes, hi, and congrats. A couple questions. Just on the financials, can you give us a sense of maybe what the normalized revenues in EBITDA wouldbe, if it wasn't for the purchase accounting treatment?"
30,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Scott Mendel,Active Network Inc,CFO,True,False,False,"Yes. So the purchase accounting treatment in 2012, as I mentioned, about -- between $10 million and $12 million on the deferred revenue haircut,and $2 million on integration costs. Without that, we would expect it to be more like a $47 million revenue number for 2012, and about $6 millionof EBITDA."
31,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Aaron Kessler,Raymond James,Analyst,True,False,False,Okay. Great. Where is the company headquarters and number of employees?
32,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Dave Alberga,Active Network Inc,CEO,True,False,False,"Yes, so about 300 employees in the headquarters -- the major facility is in Philadelphia, with a development group in San Jose, California, and thenalso one over in Shanghai."
33,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Aaron Kessler,Raymond James,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay, great. Thank you."

35,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Brian Schwartz,Thinkequity,Analyst,True,False,False,"Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. And I, too, would add the congratulations. I think it's the biggest deal you've done here since becomingpublic. Two questions. First question, Dave, StarCite was pretty well-known in the SaaS community. They were an early SaaS company that wasgrowing really fast. And along the way the business slowed here. And I don't know if that was because of the recession, or they reached marketsaturation, or what really happened. I had been hearing recently, though, that that business had reaccelerated and was doing better. My questionreally for you is, can you talk a little bit about -- I guess the go-to-market strategy, or what gives you the confidence that this business will growfaster 12 months from now than the rest of your segments? And then I have one follow-up. Thanks."
36,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Dave Alberga,Active Network Inc,CEO,True,False,False,"I'll -- I'm going to let Matt field the question. He's indicating to me, he'd like to field it, so that's fine. Go ahead, Matt."
37,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Matt Landa,Active Network Inc,President,True,False,False,"Yes. So actually, the slowdown, primarily, initially, was due to the recession and the economy. No question there. And then the second piece of itwas really a move to work away from, or work the business away from a particular channel. And it was a low profitability channel, and really justdisintermediation of a particular partner within that channel to allow for the business to move forward directly with the vendor marketplace. Andthat actually has slowed down the growth, but that had been worked out really as part of -- largely in 2010, then also kind of trailing off in 2011, inthose two years. So that now the underlying growth should be able to come to the surface and should be able to accelerate. So I think those arethe two major factors, in terms of slowing growth. And as that process gets worked through, and quite honestly, as the distractions of the acquisitionfall to the wayside here, and they're working with us, and a larger sales effort and sales team, with a better, more robust solution set, we really feelvery positive that you are going to start seeing that revenue accelerate."
38,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Brian Schwartz,Thinkequity,Analyst,True,False,False,"Great. Thank you for that color. That was very helpful. Then my follow-up question really for Scott is, I was just wondering if StarCite, if they hadany revenue internationally? Or again, for Matt, if they were distributing internationally, just wondering if this is additive at all to your overallinternational exposure? Thanks."
39,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Scott Mendel,Active Network Inc,CFO,True,False,False,"They do have a little bit of international revenue, but nothing material. So it won't radically change our revenue footprint internationally. They doservice global events, just like we have in the past, as well, and Matt mentioned a couple of the big marquee customers that they service."
40,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Matt Landa,Active Network Inc,President,True,False,False,"Yes, we view international is a big opportunity for us, for the very reason that they don't have a lot of revenue in that category now. The productis actually available in 14 languages, right? Yes."
41,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Operator,NA,NA,True,False,False,(Operator Instructions). And our next question will come from the line of Steve Rubis with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.
42,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Steven Rubis,Stifel Nicolaus,Analyst,True,False,False,"Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the acquisition. Can you discuss your outlook for the professional event managementindustry in 2012? And then can you provide some details around the seasonality of the professional management business, and StarCite as well?And how it compares to the current seasonality for you?"
43,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Matt Landa,Active Network Inc,President,True,False,False,"Yes, our outlook on the businesses that we see it continuing to be a strong business moving forward. Right? So I think that 2011 for us was a strongbusiness -- we saw a lot -- we saw a strong year. A lot of the issues from the recession seem to have gone away, and general optimism is out therewithin our customer base. So we feel good that this will continue as we move into next year."
44,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Scott Mendel,Active Network Inc,CFO,True,False,False,"Seasonality-wise, given the subscription revenue model, with over half of being that, and there's no real seasonality to the business event space.It doesn't have -- it doesn't exhibit the same seasonality that our large legacy businesses do."
45,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Matt Landa,Active Network Inc,President,True,False,False,"Yes. If anything, it would be counter cyclical, just because a lot of the events occur towards the Q4 time frame, and generally don't occur duringthe same summer months, where you have a lot of our other business that occurs. So in general, it's a nice fit with us going forward, but as Scottsaid, due to the subscription nature of StarCite, there's not as much seasonality there."
46,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Steven Rubis,Stifel Nicolaus,Analyst,True,False,False,"Great. And then secondly, would you mind discussing your thoughts on future M&A opportunities? Obviously, probably won't be able to namenames or anything like that, but could you kind of give us some color, in terms of whether you are probably going to still focus on the professionalmanagement segment? Or do you see opportunities in some of your other verticals, both going forward?"
47,18597737,THE ACTIVE NETWORK INC,01/06/2012,4:00PM,ACTV,Active Network Inc to Discuss the StarCite Acquisition Conference Call,Matt Landa,Active Network Inc,President,True,False,False,"Yes, in terms of -- just in general, we view the market -- it's a big marketplace. It's highly fragmented. And in general, we think there are M&Aopportunities through all our different verticals as we move forward. And in fact, there's a decent pipeline of those opportunities. Once again, we'relooking for the right opportunities that fit both strategically and are accretive. And as we identify those and believe that it's the right timing to dothose types of deals, I think we will continue to do those."

That's not part of our strategy."

Steve Rubis and I are in different spots, and I joined a little bit late, so I apologize if I am going to ask you to repeat yourself. But thedeal obviously gives Active scale in the business event space. Would you share with us your positioning now in the industry? Are you, for example,the clear number one player? Is there a collection of players at the top, including yourselves, Cvent and others, or kind of where are you in thatleadership scale?"

And from a high-end solutions standpoint, right -- top of the line, we believe we're the clear number one, as well in terms of dealing withmajor corporations going forward. I think that there's different niches within the business, and that we've got some serious competitors, there'sno question about it, in terms of how it breaks out from a pyramid standpoint. But we feel like we're very well-positioned now within the Fortune500 and even the Global 2000 with the StarCite acquisition, and clearly number one in terms of revenue."

It's something, I've actually spent time with a lot of you recently. It's something we're very excitedabout. We think it's a very easy and natural extension of what we're already doing in the space. We continue to look at other opportunities. This isnot -- we look across all four verticals that we're operating in for opportunities like this. So please don't get the impression that, in fact, we're on some kind of strategic shift, over specifically over to this vertical over others. We are not.We just felt like the strategic fit of this business with our existing business was warranted doing this deal. And so we're very, very excited about it.We -- I look forward to being able to show you how the integration is going in the future. So thank you very much. I really appreciate you being onthe call, and giving us the time you have."
