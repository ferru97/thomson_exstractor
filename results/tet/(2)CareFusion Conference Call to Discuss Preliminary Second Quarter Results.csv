1,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Mazzola,CareFusion Corporation,"SVP of Global Marketing, Communication & Investor Relations",False,True,False,"Thank you, Pamela. This is Jim Mazzola and thanks for joining us on today's call as we discuss CareFusion's preliminary results for the second fiscalquarter ended December 31, 2011 and provide updated guidance for our fiscal 2012. We issued a news release containing our preliminary financial results this morning at 8 a.m. Eastern Time, which is posted on our website atCareFusion.com, and filed on form 8-K with the SEC. Joining me on today's call are Kieran Gallahue, our Chairman and CEO, and Jim Hinrichs, ourCFO. Before I turn the call over to Kieran, I would like to make a few remarks. In today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures, including financial results on an adjusted basis. A reconciliation to GAAP measurescan be found in today's release and on the investors section of our website. We believe these adjusted financial measures can facilitate a morecomplete analysis and greater transparency into CareFusion's ongoing results of operations, particularly in comparing underlying results fromperiod to period. Additionally during today's call we will be making some statements that are forward-looking, including statements about expected financial resultsfor the fiscal quarter and our fiscal 2012 guidance. These results are preliminary and subject to change as we complete our quarterly close andreporting process. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties,including the risk factors set forth in today's release and our filings with the SEC. We ask that you refer to these materials for a more detailedexplanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. With that, let me turn the call over to Kieran."
2,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"All right. Thanks, Jim, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on this call on such short notice. We're in San Francisco today, meeting with a largeportion of our investors, and as such, we wanted to provide this update in order to be as transparent as possible and to make those discussionstoday as productive as possible. While we're still in the process of closing our second quarter and will report our full results on February 2, we felt it was important to release thesepreliminary results. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be between $910 million to $915 million, and adjusted operating income is expected to be $148 million to$153 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.41 to $0.45. Our largest segment, Medical Systems, performed very well in the quarter, growing in the high single digits and continuing its positive organicgrowth momentum. Bookings in all three Medical Systems businesses, dispensing, infusion, and in ventilation, were strong and remain in a goodposition for the full year. Sales and gross margins in Procedural Solutions were lower than we had forecasted, which is the primary reason operating income is lower thanour expectations. Segment revenue declined about 5%, or about 2% after adjusting out revenue from our on-site divestiture in the prior year.Procedural Solutions is comprised of four business groupings -- infection prevention, medical specialties, specialty disposables, and our diagnosticsbusinesses. Our core products in this segment continued to grow faster than the market, just slightly below our internal expectations. In addition, our margins in the segment were negatively affected by pricing pressure on our less clinically differentiated products. The net effectwas lighter conversion volumes for our products like ChloraPrep and MaxGuard and margin pressure on respiratory disposables and medicalspecialties. It's important to note that we are not losing share in our clinically differentiated products.We believe growth rates will continue to be above marketin ChloraPrep and the Medegen. ChloraPrep grew in the mid-single digits during the quarter, for example, and we have revised our fiscal year '12forecasts to reflect this trend. When we announce the full quarter, we expect to revise downward our fiscal year '12 revenue guidance for the Procedural Solutions segment andthe infection prevention businesses. On the positive side, we continue to see the benefits of our reorganization last year into the two business segments. It provides us and our investorsgreater transparency into the business. We are focused on investment in our core businesses and isolating those areas where we need to takeaction. As an example, we reorganized at the Procedural Solutions segment level during the quarter, and realigned our sales territories to decrease thewindshield time of our reps and increase the selling capacity. This will take a quarter or so to ramp, but we expect will drive additional growth inthe near term. Across the Company, we continue in Q2 to make the necessary investments we have talked about to strengthen our foundation to grow fasterover the long term.We must continue to invest during the balance of the fiscal year. So while we continue to have scenarios that enable us to meetour original full-year EPS guidance, we felt it was prudent to lower the bottom end of the adjusted EPS range by $0.05 to a new range of $1.75 to$1.90. This revision will be reflected in the Procedural Solutions segment and largely in the infection prevention business within that segment. Recall again, there are four components of infection prevention business -- ChloraPrep and Medegen, which continue to grow above market ratesand our legacy skin and legacy non-dedicated infusion disposables, which are more subject to pricing pressure.     This new EPS range reflects some upside we anticipate below the operating income line, largely due to our tax rate, which is a result of our geographicbusiness mix and our tax planning efforts. Because we are providing you with preliminary results so early in our close process, it would be prematureto give a tax rate for the quarter or the year. Based on where it comes in, we should be in a position to tighten the EPS guidance when we reporton February 2. Across both segments, the environment continues to look similar to what we discussed last quarter. Hospitals in the US continue to prioritize theirinvestments based on those products necessary to their operations. This trend has highlighted the strength of our Medical Systems products. In the Procedural Solutions segment, we continue to take share and convert markets, but as I said, at a slower rate for the reasons I described earlier.Outside the US, Western Europe remains soft, but not materially different than we indicated last quarter. And recall we are still growing ourinternational presence, so the impact there is relatively minor. We have a lot of good things going on and I feel more confident than ever in the plan that we have laid out. The segment split is going well andgiving us greater visibility. The work we are doing to simplify the business is on track and ongoing. We are building a foundation for growth andremain optimistic and committed to those plans, including our 20% plus operating margin goal exiting fiscal year 2014. We will provide a more complete update when we have the full results of February 2, so I'm going to say in advance that we won't have all thedetail today, but wanted to provide you with as much detail as we can at this early point in our close process. With that, I want to make sure that Jim and I have time for your questions, so, Pamela, if we can open up the Q&A line, we will begin."

4,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Amit Bhalla,Citi,Analyst,True,False,False,"Good morning. Two quick questions for you. First, last quarter, when you were talking about the infection prevention business, you talked aboutthe impact of procedure volumes and distributor purchasing being slightly weaker. Can you comment on that in particular? And then just secondly,can you quantify the level of pricing pressure that you are seeing? Thanks."
5,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,True,False,False,"It's Jim Hinrichs, and Kieran can chime in here if he'd like. We are not seeing increased pressure in procedure volumes. I wouldn't say that thingsare rebounding dramatically, but we are not pointing at that as a major driver here. And when it comes to -- the second part of your question was about pricing pressure -- about pricing pressure, we do continue to see pricingpressure in specific businesses, and those are the ones that are less clinically differentiated. So when I look at our product lines in respiratorydisposables and legacy prep, as well as our legacy non-dedicated infusion sets, those are the areas where we are seeing pricing pressure. I think itranges from a few points into the mid single digits of pricing push back to us from our customers."
6,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",True,False,False,"Just a chip shot on that, Amit. It's not as if we're seeing a rebound on a procedure volumes side. It's just that we wouldn't point to that as the primarydriver. We are seeing it across both of our conversion-oriented businesses. What we are seeing is that we're not losing market share. We still feelvery good from a competitive perspective, and that's the feedback that we are getting from the orthogonal checkpoints in the field. What it does seem is that in the environment that we are at, some of the conversion efforts are just taking a bit longer than they have in the past.And what you do is when you are sitting across from these hospital administrators, they see the value. Sometimes what you will do is you'll get aconversion of 50% of the hospital or the hospital systems, and that second part of the conversion is usually a lot of street fighting, where you arein there, you are looking for different levels of the organization to support you in that conversion. Right now, they are a bit distracted, and we are not seeing that same level of support simply because they've got multiple priorities. But the goodnews, we are not losing market share there. We are still growing above market rates, and we are steady as she goes. Also, this adjustment in the sales force is going to allow us to have greater resources being focused in front of the customers as opposed to in frontof the windshield. So we are taking the actions to become more efficient and more effective with our customers as well."
7,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Amit Bhalla,Citi,Analyst,True,False,False,"Kieran, you mentioned distributors as an issue last quarter. Was that resolved or are distributors --?"
8,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,True,False,False,"It's Jim.That very specific -- obviously, inventory changes throughout the channel all the time in all the product lines.The specific issue we pointedto last quarter did not repeat in this quarter, so that seems to have leveled itself out. That was specifically, if you remember, destocking in theinfection prevention businesses, which seems to have leveled off now. So we are kind of -- we feel like we are back to normal in that part of thebusiness from that perspective."
9,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Amit Bhalla,Citi,Analyst,True,False,False,Okay. Thank you.

11,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Matt Taylor,Barclays Capital,Analyst,True,False,False,"A couple of quick ones. One, I just wanted to understand within Procedural Solutions, I know you talked about pressure on products that were notclinically differentiated. But was there any one or two areas in particular with the surgical tools or some of the disposables where the pressure waskind of outside?"
12,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",True,False,False,"Well, Jim and I will sort of tag team a little bit on this. Certain areas such as the respiratory disposables, where there is very little clinical differentiation-- I mean, some segments, there's a lot, but there is other niches within that where there's not as much differentiation. That is subject much moreto the pricing pressures we have seen.     We haven't really on the surgical tools side seen dramatic pricing pressure at all. In fact, we feel like we're doing -- we are not doing gangbustersthere, but we feel like from a competitive perspective as we looked around, we actually feel like we are doing better than competitors and feel likewe're gaining some share. So it is in some very targeted areas, some on the valve business. The newer stuff, like the Medegens and whatnot, very clinically differentiated.Some of the existing product lines that have been in the market for a longer time, they're going to be a little bit more subject to those pressures."
13,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,True,False,False,"That's exactly right. Again, the three product lines we have mentioned that have pricing pressure -- respiratory disposables, legacy prep, legacynon-dedicated -- all those products that are just not as clinically differentiated therefore tougher to command a price premium."
14,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Matt Taylor,Barclays Capital,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay. And you lowered the low end of the EPS guidance, but I think you mentioned at the beginning of your comments that you saw really nochange to your longer-term margin improvement goals. And I was just curious with this increased pressure how you are going to be able to absorbor offset that and still achieve those goals."
15,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",True,False,False,"Look, we've got a lot of things going on around the Company there's a lot of shots on goal when it comes to building efficiencies to reducingcomplexities to be helping us become more efficient in front of those customers. When you are going through these changes, sometimes it can get a little bit bumpy on a quarterly basis. And I think we have been pretty openabout that from the beginning. So when you have a little bit of changes in the mix like we have seen this time, we are feeling pretty good aboutyear-end on the top line overall. It's just about sort of the mix of getting there. And so we think that the focus that we have on simplifying the business, on continuing to gain efficiencies, on some of the improvements we aremaking in the sales force, particularly in the Procedural Solutions side, to be able to help those reps be able to spend more time in front of thecustomers, we think they are going to pay dividends, and we are steady as she goes on those things.We don't want to pull back on the investmenton those."
16,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,True,False,False,Exactly.
17,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Matt Taylor,Barclays Capital,Analyst,True,False,False,"All right, thanks a lot, guys."
18,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Operator,NA,NA,True,False,False,"Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan."
19,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Mike Weinstein,JPMorgan,Analyst,True,False,False,"Help me out here. I just wanted to understand a couple items. So If I look at the details you gave out in the release, your revenues actually are prettyclose to where we were at, but there's a much bigger drop-off on the EBIT line. And then when you guide to EPS, it's actually relatively close. So can you just explain that sequence there? So revenues don't appear like they are that different than we were forecasting, but there's a muchlarger drop on the EBIT line. And then EPS, it seems like you seem to make up some of the gap. So is the expectation for the quarter and then forthe year that you'll make up some of the -- some of an EBIT shortfall below that line with a lower tax rate?"
20,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,True,False,False,"Yes, a couple -- that's a great question, Mike, and this is probably worth taking a minute to go through. A couple of things going on. The first is revenue came in a little bit light.We were facing an EBIT number for the quarter, based on preliminary results, that was different enoughfrom our expectations that we thought it worthwhile saying it now, so when we are out in front of 50% or 60% of our shareholders today we couldhave meaningful conversations. And so that was sort of the reason for the preannouncement. Revenue, as you mentioned, coming in just slightly below what the Street was expecting, also below what our expectations were. But two thingsare really going on. One is there is a revenue shortfall, and the revenue shortfall is largely in our higher-margin products. So that's driving a larger-- or a disproportionately large EBIT miss. The second thing going on is these less differentiated products, with the pricing pressure we have seen in this quarter, is also driving a marginpush -- driving margin pressure. So you end up with what I would describe as a disproportionate gross margin and EBIT impact on our bottom linefor the quarter. And that was really the reason for the release. Now, we do have some below-the-line upside in interest and other, and we believe in the tax rate, although the tax rate won't be finalized untilthe end of this week, that will offset some of the difference, and that will carry through to the year. So when you take what we have said today andtranslate it for the year, the way you need to look at it is to say, look, revenue probably still within the range we provided, but we are losing somerevenue growth in the higher-margin products. We've got gross margin pressure creating sort of what I would describe as a dime of EBIT pressure out of Procedural Solutions that we will makeup below the line, primarily on the tax rate, which is why we only took that tax rate -- the EPS number, the bottom of the range, down by a nickeluntil we can get our tax forecast done, and then we will retighten up the range back to a dime. That's the goal. So did that make sense?"
21,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",True,False,False,"Sounds like (inaudible). But let me just make one final comment on that, which is maybe a bit more qualitative.When you walk through this, I thinkit's not unlikely that maybe 90% of the companies would not have pre-released an earnings today with regards to this.We feel that the environmentis out there -- clearly, there's a lot going on in the world economy and the stock markets, et cetera. We have committed that we would be astransparent as we can with everybody. And even in situations where we think we can claw back quite a bit through things like our very aggressiveand worthwhile tax management strategies, our view is that if we got there different, we wanted to be able to talk openly and give you as muchvisibility as we can. So that's the intention of doing this."

23,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,David Roman,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,True,False,False,"I had two quick questions. One is -- am I correct that FX -neutral revenue growth for the first half of the year is running between 2% and 2.5%? Andif that is correct, can you maybe bridge these current levels to the 3% to 5% you are guiding to for the full year?"
24,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,True,False,False,"David, it's Jim. I don't have those constant currency revenue growth yet. But I think the first quarter was around 2%, and then this quarter, don'thave that adjusted out yet completely. But that's probably about right. We are expecting a pickup, obviously, in revenue in the back half of theyear. We'll give all of that detail as to where we expect that to take place in the earnings release."
25,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,David Roman,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay. And then secondly, and maybe more broadly, if you look at the long-term operating margin targets that you have put out there and we lookat this quarter, can you maybe just remind us to what extent top-line performance and EBIT margin performance are connected and what flexibilityyou have to continue to expand EBIT margins should in fact the top line remain under pressure?"
26,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,True,False,False,"Yes, sure. Certainly the two things are connected.We believe we have different plans and different contingencies that continue to allow us to drivemargins, even in a lower growth environment. Certainly top line helps -- as we have been very consistent in saying all along, top-line growthcertainly helps our leverage story, but we are not dependent on it. What we saw this quarter was mix working against us a little bit, and we saw pricing pressure working against us a little bit. But we are now -- justas Kieran mentioned earlier, we're doing some things that are making changes that we think will reignite the mix back in our favor in terms ofputting our sales forces together and making them more productive and filling their bags more and increasing their overall capacity. So I think there continue to be opportunities to get mix working back in our favor. We are still very committed to that long-term growth, thelong-term margin target. It does require top-line growth, but we have scenarios planned out under low growth and sort of medium or highergrowth that can still get us there, which is why we are still absolutely committed to those targets. It just requires a slightly different way of gettingthere."
27,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",True,False,False,"Just to add on a little bit. As you might expect, when we look at our investment philosophy within the business, we are certainly targeting thoseareas that we think, A, have the most opportunity for expansion and growth, and B, would have a disproportionate impact on the profitability. Soyou would expect that of us and that's certainly what we are doing. This movement to the two-segment structure, it was really critical in that process. Because by separating out the Medical Systems businesses andthe Procedural Solutions, you invest differently in each of those businesses and you need to manage them different. And they were subsumed inthese more complicated business units before that didn't allow for true execution on a differentiated investment strategy. So the benefits of that are going to be yielded over time, but the structural changes are the things that were absolutely required for us to gain thevisibility and be able to differentially invest in those businesses."

30,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,David Lewis,Morgan Stanley,Analyst,True,False,False,"Good morning. Jim, I know you don't have the specifics on sort of where the leverage, both gross margin and EBIT, kind of landed for the quarter.But I wonder, given that gross margin pressures would seem obvious, whether they are pricing or mix, last quarter we didn't see the type of SG&Aleverage I think some investors were hoping for. Is it possible to share with us whether despite that gross margin pressure whether you think therewas evidence that you drove SG&A leverage in this particular quarter as you anniversaried some of that front-end spend last quarter?"
31,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,True,False,False,"Certainly, my expectation is and preliminary results would indicate that our SG&A as a percent of sales was considerably lower in the second quarterthan in the first quarter. Again, numbers aren't final, but that is my expectation. That was my expectation, and the preliminary results indicate thatthat is the case. Year over year, given some of the gross margin pressure that we've seen and given some of the revenue pressures that we had, I think it's probablygoing to be -- SG&A as a percent of sales will likely be in line with what we saw last year -- I don't think either a strong move one way or the other.Again, very preliminary results, so you're not going to see a reduction, but you're also not going to see an increase. So we continue to look at thatline that's one of the things we're taking a look at over the course of the next 30 days, to figure out what we can do there to continue the trendthat we want to see."

A good exampleof that would be some of the outside resources that we've pulled in in order to help us work through the project-planning process to make surethat as we attack the complexity and we attack the cost structure, that we do it in a way that orients us towards growth and towards executioncapability, as opposed to sort of meandering your way through it. So there is some investment in that as well that I think is important for us toknow."

Last quarter, we were quite successfulin getting spend moved from administrative functions into customer-facing and revenue-generating and R&D and innovation type spend. AndI'm assuming and hoping that we will see that continued trend in the second quarter."
34,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,David Lewis,Morgan Stanley,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay. And Kieran, one quick question on ChloraPrep. What we've seen with this business is some periods of acceleration and deceleration. Mostspecifically coming off the New England Journal of Medicine article, we saw an acceleration in this business and a renewed sales effort. Is what we     are seeing now sort of a relative level of maturation in the ChloraPrep product line, or do you think this is just really more of kind of a breathingquarter for the product, if you will?"
35,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",True,False,False,"It's a good question, and it's one that we are obviously trying to dig in and understand at a very deep level. I think what would give me confidenceto say that we still have a lot of headroom in that business is that we saw very similar dynamics with the Medegen business as we did with theChloraPrep business. And both those businesses have the same core drivers, which is their conversion businesses. And when you tend to convert,you convert large parts of hospital systems and then have to street fight to get it all the way across and change behavior. So the fact that they had similar dynamics would lead us to believe that -- and obviously, as I said it was orthogonally checked you're out in thefield and you're asking questions -- that that was the primary driver. Now obviously, whenever you get -- the more penetrated you get, it does get harder, and so there's no question about that. And the percentagechange is always a change over time, right, the law of big numbers. But again, I think just from what we think happened this quarter, I think it wasmuch more about converting practices across the businesses as opposed to any specific line item."

Just to follow up on the ChloraPrep line, I am just wondering -- you're saying it has become more difficult to convert accounts. I'm justwondering if you're assuming that that changes going forward. In other words, is 5% growth kind of the new normal or are you assuming in yourguidance that improves?"
39,18608926,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",True,False,False,"Again, good question, and I think it's too early to say near-term what we think those figures will be. And we will certainly, I think, in February at therelease time be able to give a little bit more detail on that. I think the conservative way that we are looking at it is to say near-term, there's probably still going to be some reticence on the part of the hospitalsto convert their practices at the same rate that they were converting, say, a year or two ago. That being said, that doesn't mean it's going to staythat way and it's not going to change back. And from our perspective, part of what we are doing to help that along is to recognize that we have the ability to put more effective resources infront of the customers. And so this adjustment I've referred to a couple of times in the sales force that we did during the second quarter was reallytaking reps that had different products, but they had the same call points, the same customers, the same territories overall. And by combining theirbags and helping them manage the way that they message in front of the customer, it makes their interactions with the customers more holistic.They are able to sell the full portfolio of products that are oriented in our infection prevention area on one side. And on the other side, it says thatthey don't have to spend most of the life traveling around their territory, but they can actually use it in a more practical way.     So there's lots of things that influence. There is the behavior of the customers themselves, and then there is how we help manage it. Because ourjob is not to accept market growth it's to drive market growth. And we will continue to focus on that."

I think Jim talked about you guys grew about 2% on an organic constant-currency basis for thefirst of the year, which is actually 3% just on a constant-currency basis, so within your guidance range. But comps get tougher in the back half of the year, so I'm just wondering kind of what -- how investors can get comfort that you guys can keeptop-line growth within that range even in spite of difficult comps. Are there certain areas where you expect to see growth accelerate? Or maybe ifyou can just speak a little bit to the back half of the year."

All of thatwill be out in the second quarter. So until we get -- I don't want to get pinned down to any specific numbers in the first half or second quarter untilwe have all the results in front of us. Kieran can chime in on this as well. We have set in place at the beginning of the year and continue to see faster growth in the second half of theyear than we will see in the first half of the year. There are a number of businesses where we would expect to see that. Certainly that we initiallyexpected that the Procedural Solutions business would grow faster in the second half of the year than the first half. I think we still believe that tobe the case absolutely it's just not going to be as much as what we had originally planned. In addition, some of the businesses in Medical Systems are getting traction. In particular, I'd point to respiratory technologies and ventilation,where, if you remember, we started off the year a little bit down in the first quarter. And I think we're going to see continued improvement in thatbusiness through the year. That will drive some growth in the second half of the year. And some of the other businesses in the Medical Systems,infusion as well, might continue to accelerate growth in the back half of the year. So there will be faster growth in the second half -- or we believe there will be faster growth in the second half of the year versus the first half of theyear. And again, as I said, once we get everything buttoned down, we will make sure we give you the detail on where we think that's going to comefrom on February 2."

Great, thanks. I just wanted to double check. You guys had said you expect I guess in February to revise down for theProcedural Solutions, and that was just because of the infection prevention business. Is that correct?"

So we will be making that revision -- as I mentioned earlier, we are looking at a revision downward in EBIT, primarily inthe Procedural Solutions business. And then we believe there's some upside below the line that we will also be taking into account. So when wenarrow that range, it will be somewhere between the $1.75 to $1.90, that's correct."

And then just on the Medical Systems sales, you had mentioned dispensing, infusion and ventilation were all strong. Could you just maybegive us a little bit more color there? It sounds like you're not seeing any changes with like hospital CapEx or anything in that regard. I was a littlebit surprised by ventilation also being up."

But I will say that, yes, the businesssegment overall is performing very well. I think we are very fortunate that the medical systems that we sell are essential to the efficient operations of hospitals. And we are seeing a lot ofinterest from customers as they look to try to get better scale on their human capital, particularly in the nursing area, where they are trying to getbetter control over their supply chain and particularly in pharmacy. And we help in each of those areas. So we are quite fortunate. And yes, I canappreciate the question on ventilation, but the ventilation business has been performing well. So that was across the segment."
