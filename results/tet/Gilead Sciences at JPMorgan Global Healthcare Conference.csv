1,18609130,GILEAD SCIENCES INC.,01/09/2012,5:00PM,GILD,Gilead Sciences at JPMorgan Global Healthcare Conference,John Martin,"Gilead Sciences, Inc.",Chairman and CEO,False,True,False,"Thanks, Geoff. It's always a pleasure to participate in this conference. We, at Gilead, had a very exciting year last year, that's for sure. We'veaccomplished a lot and I'm proud to have the opportunity to tell you about that and tell you what we expect for the coming year. So, at first, I'll mention that there are forward-looking statements in this presentation and our GAAP reconciliation is available on our website. So,the very significant accomplishments in 2011, these are a few. We received Complera approval, it's the second single-tablet regimen that containsthree drugs for treatment of AIDS and launched in U.S., Canada and the European Union. We presented topline results from two pivotal studies on Quad, which will be the third single-tablet regimen. We filed for approval in the [EU andwe] expect to launch it during this calendar year. We acquired additional assets in oncology and inflammation by acquiring two companies, Arresto and Calistoga. And then, finally, entered intoan agreement to acquire Pharmasset. It's a company that has a leading candidate for the treatment of hepatitis C. We have some additionalcandidates in our portfolio. I'll tell you about this. A key attribute of this is the success we've had in HIV and hepatitis B, means we have the scientific, medical and commercial capabilities to do avery good job commercializing hepatitis C products. This shows our portfolio of 14 products that are currently marketed [either] on our own or through partner promotion. On the left is HIV and thesecond column is hepatitis B. So those are our virology franchises. Viread is the foundation of both of those. Viread is our first product for the treatment of HIV, approved just over 10 years ago. HIV disease or AIDSneeds to be treated with three oral antivirals simultaneously and in past, taking multiple pills multiple times a day, led to failure. What we intended to do at Gilead was to simplify therapy with really well-tolerated drugs. So Viread is once a day. Our second product, Emtriva, isalso once a day. We combined them together into two pills and one tablet and that's called Truvada. That was launched in 2004 and really startedto transform the treatment of HIV. We partnered with Bristol Myers and Merck, with their efavirenz to combine it with Truvada to have a single-tablet regimen, Atripla, and morerecently with Johnson & Johnson and their rilpivirine to have Complera."
