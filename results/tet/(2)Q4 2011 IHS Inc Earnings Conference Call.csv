1,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Suzi Stein,Morgan Stanley,Analyst,False,True,False,"You saw a nice improvement in organic revenue growth. But how much of it is attributed to bringing in acquisitions that anniversaried,and moving under-performing businesses to Discontinued Operations? What I'm trying to figure out is how did the underlyingbusiness perform if you were to comp it to Q3 growth?"
2,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Jerre Stead,IHS Inc.,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"That's a good question, Suzi. Scott would look forward to answering that."
3,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Scott Key,IHS Inc.,"President, COO",False,True,False,"Sure would. Suzi, we actually saw very broad and solid organic performance across the business. And I'll give you a few examples.We gave you the region numbers where you saw positive growth. Our subscription base really trended up and positively across theglobe. In Americas, we saw a series of areas of double-digit organic growth in automotive, the transportation sector, our coreeconomics offerings, and our offerings in manufacturing and design and energy technical. We saw really positive improvement inour strategically managed accounts that drove organic growth higher. And we saw that in all regions, real good progress, 3 to 5 percentage points of additional, above our average organic growth instrategically managed accounts in the Americas, EMEA and APAC. And then the other point of growth driver, as you heard, LatinAmerica, 20%-plus, and of course, APAC, 20%-plus. So, really strong fundamentals. And I think the other point to mention is thatwas matched, regardless of organic or inorganic on acquisitions. Acquisitions in general delivered about 16% year-on-year growthon average. So, we really saw solid performance everywhere."

If you look, our fastest-growing business continued to be the energy business inQ4, remarkable performance. There was no shift with the organic growth there. It did not include any acquisitions falling into Q4.So, just a really great quarter everywhere. Thank you. Next question."

And maybe an example being howmuch percent of your renewals to your subscriptions occur or have already occurred coming into 2012? And just somewhat relatedto that in terms of just, again, on the back of the economic environment, what changes, if any, are there to your appetite for M&Athis year?"
7,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Jerre Stead,IHS Inc.,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"Great question. Let me pick it up, and we'll start with that, Manav. Actually, you just tried to sneak in a second question. But I'llprobably respond to that quickly for everybody. A very good question. 32% of our renewals occur in Q1. Q4 is our second strongest,and then the other two are a bit lighter. If you think about the fact that we're a November 30 business, December is a big month forus, as you would expect, because a lot of companies that are on a calendar year do renew then. So, 32%. I'm going to have Scottgive a little color on that in just a second. On your question B, we are feeling very good. Continue to, with the acquisition pipeline we've got, complementary, fit our strategicgoals and will fit going forward. So, we feel very good about that. Before I color Scott on Manav's first question, then Rich, anythingelse you've got on M&A?"
8,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Rich Walker,IHS Inc.,"EVP, CFO",False,True,False,"I was just echoing the renewal profile. It's 60%, one-third of it in the first quarter. So, the visibility on how we exit the year gives usgreat confidence.The M&A pipeline, in general, it remains very robust.Very pleased with the broad-based distribution of it, particularlythe focus on emerging and growth economies and industries that we're keenly focused on."

As we sit at this point in time, we have visibilityto about 60% of our renewal base, as Rich mentioned. So, 30%-plus in Q1, and also a large portion in Q4. So, obviously we're workingthree, four, five months ahead with customers. So, we really have great visibility to over 60% of the renewal base as we sit here inearly January, good view on the year, and obviously strong momentum coming out of the end of last year. The other thing to note is our renewals still, on average, tend to be above 90%. And really great discipline with new sales systemswhere you see, first of all, the timeliness of renewals at the highest levels ever in the Company. And that's just a sales system wedeployed over the last year, focused on the right structure and organization in sales. And of course, good global sales operationsprocesses."

Andare you still pushing towards that 9% for the overall year?"
13,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Jerre Stead,IHS Inc.,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"Excellent question. As you remember, on our 2012 guidance call, Scott told us that his personal goal was 9% organic. And yourquestion's a good one, Eric, because an important part of that is the Other category, about 22%, 23% of our total. So, Scott, pick upboth pieces?"
14,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Scott Key,IHS Inc.,"President, COO",False,True,False,"Yes, thanks. And what you saw in Q4, actually, was those non-subscription areas lifting the business and performing really positively.And I'll tell you, we've spent, Eric, a lot of time over the last two years ensuring that those non-subscription parts of our businesswere tightly connected with the subscription part of the business. And that's helping us drive growth. So, I'd tell you three things.One, part of those nonrecurring businesses are connections, integration, and tighter value creation around our information forcustomers. And we've launched some electronic information management services over the last year, which are growing above     20%, and really tightly linked to our underlying information subscription base growth. So, really strong performance there innonrecurring that's driving growth. Then in terms of services, advisory services and consulting, we saw positive performance all through the year. And ended the yearin double-digit growth there in each region as a result of, again, tying our advisory services to our insight and analytics, and reallymeasured growth of that business. So, we feel good about the level where we have demand higher, we're able to fulfill. That's agreat place to be right now. And then the last piece that's in that nonrecurring area, of course, is some of our software and platform sales, both in energy, greatwork flow tools that tie our information with our analytics. And of course, in environment. So, all of those three areas of solid growthby region that we feel good about as we head into the year."
15,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Jerre Stead,IHS Inc.,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,Thank you. Good question. Next?
16,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Operator,NA,NA,False,True,False,Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.
17,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Peter Appert,Piper Jaffray & Co.,Analyst,False,True,False,"Jerre, this is one question, and it revolves around margins. And what I'd like to know is, as we think about 2012, what are the keydrivers of the margin improvement? How important are Vanguard and Newton to the upside you see? And can you talk a little bitabout the seasonality in margins? Is it going to be as fourth-quarter loaded in '12 as it was in '11?"
18,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Jerre Stead,IHS Inc.,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"Excellent question, Peter. Thank you. I'll work backwards on it. As you heard Rich talk just now, in that package that's on our website,you'll see, to make sure we see and help you with what goes on quarter by quarter, you'll see that adjusted 2011 quarter-by-quarterpercent of profit -- 30% in Q4, 21% in Q1. So, using that, there's three key factors that have happened. One, we did want to give youthat perspective because with the acquisitions we've actually seen a shift of an increase in EBITDA profit in Q4, and we've got thatbuilt in. Secondly, we're feeling very good, I must say, about the amazing effort that has gone on with Vanguard, our Centers ofExcellence, many other things at the same time. Scott mentioned in his part of the prepared script the fact that we'll also be introducing more new products in 2012 than we havein the history of our business. So, if you think about new products taking a while to move in, and take on the opportunity for growth,all of those drive us pretty clearly to that 30% that we say happened last year, as one that we would expect to see continue as amodel. I'm going to ask Rich to pick up, and Scott, in just a second. But the other thing is, we felt very good all year long. I know many of our investors were wondering whether we would indeed deliverthe 32% margin in Q4 that we were consistent about all year. We did that. We feel very good about where we're going into 2012. Alot of productivity improvements, sales force automation, et cetera. Equally important is to think through into 2013 because as weexit 2012, many of the benefits of scaling, as Scott mentioned in his call, for the first time will now be in place. So, increasing amountof confidence in our ability to give significant, as Rich's comment was in his wrap-up, margin improvement in 2011, Q4, more tocome in 2012.     Rich?"
19,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Rich Walker,IHS Inc.,"EVP, CFO",False,True,False,"The mix question is really critical to us, I think, Peter. The acquisitions, SMT and the size of that, and our new pension accountinggoing forward is ratably and it is included in adjusted EBITDA. So, the table is one we would encourage you to study and come back.Profit and margin profile is a function. It all begins with revenue. And we've demonstrated to you when we can grow the top line atan 8% to 10% level, and aggressively manage the cost control, we can consistently deliver between 100 and 150 basis points ofmargin improvement. And that's a function of many things, including prioritizing our investments. And I think we're keenly focusedon doing that."

And of course, our goal is to deliver that or better for the full year. So, justthink about where we are and then that full year delivery, Peter. But also a couple things that we've mentioned. We've spent the lastfour quarters investing in scale. We now have three Centers of Excellence globally. We're rolling out Vanguard to almost half of thebusiness right now, and sales force automation tools everywhere. To your question about how things grow in scale, what I mentioned is we're starting to see the benefit of those investments, significantones over the last four quarters, in the top line.We're seeing it begin to drive our growth, and we're going to increasingly see it driveefficiencies. We have another four quarters, as you know, of Vanguard deployment, of Newton, and sales force optimization toolsin process. Those will help us all the way through the year, and as Jerre said, into 2013. So, we should expect to see the benefit ofthat scale, some additional efficiencies build through the year. So, that's what you should expect to see on our margin goals."

I'm not sure which one's which here though, so let me just start. On Peter's question, just toclarify the guidance for '12, you did 32% margin in the fourth quarter. The '12 guidance is 32% or better. Is the expectation in Q1 orQ2 to be down from the Q4 you just did, but still up year over year? I understand what you're talking about seasonality of the profitdistribution, but can you talk more specifically about the expectation of margin ramp? Then I have a follow-up."
24,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Jerre Stead,IHS Inc.,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"That's a good question, Michael. The answer is yes to your question. Yes, you're right on. And if you do that analysis, again, usingthat 21% Q1 of our guidance EBITDA, 30% Q4, you'll get there. And you'll see a number that we'll do our very best to deliver in Q4that is a significant improvement. But Scott's point of 32% all-in year over year versus the 30.2% in 2011 gives you a pretty goodthought. That's 180 basis points for openers.     Now, the next clarification -- or your question."
25,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Michael Meltz,JPMorgan,Analyst,False,True,False,"Yes, this might be the question. I appreciate the slides on the pension changes. Perhaps this might be better offline, but the $57million contribution, or however you're defining it, you talked about some buyouts and other changes that might occur. Is there anadditional expectation of cash that will be done throughout '12, in addition to that?"
26,18597104,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Jerre Stead,IHS Inc.,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"Actually, I'll answer that only. Just so we're clear though, and it's a good question, Michael the answer's no to that question. So we'reclear, we are happy to take as much time afterwards on one-on-one calls, or anything else that we need to do, along with that deckthat we put on the website. And we'll also send that deck out to you, all of our investors, right after we finish this call, to make surewe do the clarification. Most important thing is that we've now really positioned ourselves to take any future risk of consequenceoff the table with the pension program. But that clarification question is a good one. Next questions, thank you."

Thanks."

One, the fourth quarter rate is clearly an anomaly that's driven entirely by the pension adjustment. I think ifyou normalize for that, the fourth quarter GAAP rate was 24.2%. And an adjusted tax rate at about a 27%, 28%, as well. So, really thecombination of the discrete items for the total year, and in the fourth quarter in particular, created a lot of noise in that metric."

And that is a traditionally consistent metric from atax rate perspective."

Canwe get a little color maybe on some of the industry and vertical trends that you saw over there?"

It was a shame on us, or me, in Q3. We actually had quite solid subscription-basedorganic growth in Q3 in EMEA, 6%-plus. We didn't do our colleagues justice there because it was the transaction stuff that pulled itdown to the less than 2%. So, it was good and solid and significantly increasing in Q4. And Scott, you'll love giving him color on that."

Just as we said through the year, despite a challenging environment, we're focused in the rightmarkets on the right customers. And of course, bringing a lot of value to their operations. And we talked about the headwinds, andreally seeing the bottom in terms of, for example, defense and security. And that's what's played out. So, really solid double-digitsubscription growth that's pretty broad-based, Bill. Strong performance in energy. Very good performance in terms of defense andsecurity. And then I would say the other areas that really performed well, performed well globally. So, chemicals performing very well. TMT,supply chains around manufacturing doing quite well. And then transportations, and particularly, autos. And also, we had reallysolid growth in the nonrecurring parts of the business in EMEA. And the last thing I would add is the strategically managed accountprogram. We had a lot of great wins across those markets, and good performance as we connected with very large customers, aswell."

A two-part question, borrowing from my peers'examples. The first part is more of a bookkeeping here. I know, Rich, you gave the deferred revenue growth in total. What was theorganic deferred revenue growth on the balance sheet?"

We've talked in the past about inefficiencies as high as 30% to 40% in the sales force. So, we'll seeseveral things happen. Shifting resource and focus within the existing sales force and our sales costs to emerging markets. And wesaw that last year. We'll see that continue. Latin America, as well as APAC, where we have high opportunity and high growth rates.We'll also see Vanguard roll out through the year. And what that does for us is it starts to give us a consistent view of customersglobally, and then connects with our sales force automation SFA tool. We've got about 95% of the sales force on SFA, and almost$1.8 billion in sales opportunities flowing through that system. Another thing that I'll mention quickly is we've got all three Centers of Excellence up and running in terms of order management.So, quote, all the way through delivery. And we'll see that make the sales force more efficient as we move through the year. Probablythe most of that benefit will start to come from the back end as we get Vanguard fully deployed and we get people up in thoseCenters and fully trained. So, we'll see the benefit continue. We saw it some in the last quarter. We'll see it increase through the year,and then strong benefit in 2013."

But on the organic growth rate for revenue, is there anything technical we need     to be aware of as we head into 1Q and through the year that could cause that to accelerate or decelerate? Like, for example, in 4Qthe anniversary effect certainly helped. And as I think about the quick cadence of the acquisitions you had in the year you justcompleted, SMT is by far the largest. And so, should we be expecting an acceleration baked into your outlook in 4Q because of that?"

I'll start, and have Scott pick up on that. And I'll go back to pick up a bit on Suzi's, too. Welook at some 30 different product revenue bases, actually daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly. If you'll remember, Scott said in the lasttwo calls that 85% of our revenue was exceeding 10%. It was actually in double-digit organic growth. And that doesn't include theacquisitions we've made. If you add those in for their own internal organic growth, it's actually north of there. Just for color, to give you a view, we range anywhere from 22%, 23% organic growth in a given quarter on some product lines toflat or thereabouts negative on some of the other product lines. Scott mentioned in his call, on the formal part of the call, what we'redoing in having a continuing effort looking forward to those that are not meeting our double-digit goals on organic growth. Andhow we'll review those businesses and products, either to increase spending to get them into double digits or make other decisions. So with that as background, pick up on the rest of the question."

So, Jerre'stold you we have a great part of the portfolio that's in double digit today. You heard us say in terms of acquisitions that theiryear-on-year growth rate on average is about 16%. So, they're performing very well. What I would say is, as we've said for the lastfew months, we feel good about the foundation of the business.We continue with the highest level of transformation as we continueto roll out Newton, and staff our Centers for order entry all the way through delivery. And we're mindful of the economy that we'resitting in. So, we're balancing those factors with, I think, what is a strong foundation to the year, and a plan that we believe we candeliver."

Baird & Company, Inc.",Analyst,False,True,False,"Just wanted to ask a little bit on the cost side related to margins. Particularly in the Americas region, margins down a little bitsequentially. Are there any one-time factors in there that we should think about as we go into next year around Vanguard or Newtonor any of these other projects with the customer excellence centers that were more one-time in nature in the fourth quarter thatheld that down?"

The answer is no, nothing in specific, other than we did mention that we now havefully running the Centers of Excellence in both EMEA and in the Americas. And that's been an investment of significance in Q2, 3 and4. And that APAC is now up and running as we begin the first quarter of 2012. And we feel very good about that progress. Nothingunusual at all though, from a standpoint in the Americas, just a really great performance in total. Thanks, Dan."

But you've also made the comment thatthey're relatively still under-penetrated, maybe 25% penetrated. As we think about the product development over the next severalquarters, will there be a focus on driving increased penetration among those top 1,000? Or are you maybe making some adjustmentsto appeal to the customers outside that 1,000, or to look to bring on some brand-new clients? Thanks."

We're relentlessly focused on those 1,000. And as I said, there's a differential growthrate in those accounts. Extra 6 points, 6% of customer delight in those accounts, and 2 to 3 points of organic growth in those accounts.We're expanding them to 250. We've just made some changes, as you've seen. Announced a new global sales lead, a single globalsales operations function. And the goal there with SFA is to get laser focused on those 1,000 accounts, and to continue that momentum. The other thing we're doing is the transactions part of our business, all the way at the other end of the spectrum, has been anunder-performer. We've got great valuable information globally, and so we're investing in that this year. And in the middle whatyou have is inside sales and field managed, which we're looking at process and efficiency in. So, really good focus on each, butcertainly laser focused on the top 1,000."
