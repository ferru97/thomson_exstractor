2,18608689,THERAVANCE INC,01/09/2012,1:30PM,THRX,THERAVANCE INC GSK and Theravance Announce Initial Outcomesfrom Pivotal Phase III Studies for Once,Rick Winningham,"Theravance, Inc.",Chairman & CEO,False,True,False,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I would like you to turn your attention to the first slide after the Safe Harbor statement in theslide deck. We are pleased to announce that earlier this morning GSK and Theravance issued a release announcing a decision to commence regulatory filingsin Europe and the US for COPD and the EU for asthma in mid-2012. We also announced that given the data in the program with -- asthma data inthe program with GSK, GSK intends to continue their discussions with FDA regarding the asthma package.The release also announces the completionof the Phase 3 registrational program for Relovair in COPD and all but one of the studies in asthma. The release provides a top-line summary of all Phase 3 studies completed to date.The six-month COPD studies were omitted because top-line datawere previously communicated last June. These studies collectively represent the largest initial registration package of an inhaled respiratorymedicine for the treatment of these debilitating diseases completed to date. With the release today, we now have reported data for Phase 3 studies that enrolled approximately 11,000 patients. GSK and Theravance believethat the overall results from these studies show that Relovair, dosed once a day, demonstrated improvements in lung function and reductions inexacerbations in both COPD and asthma. In addition, GSK plans to begin additional clinical work to investigate the potential effects of Relovair inreal-world effectiveness studies. As a reminder, Relovair is an inhaled combination treatment comprised of a once-daily corticosteroid fluticasone furoate and a once daily long-actingbeta agonist, vilanterol, currently under development for both COPD and asthma. The Phase 3 pivotal program in COPD consists of five studiesand approximately 6,000 patients. In asthma the Phase 3 pivotal program consists of seven studies and approximately 5,000 patients. In addition to the pivotal studies, GSK is conducting a 16,000 patient outcome study, real-world effectiveness studies that I mentioned earlier, andhead-to-head comparator studies as a part of a comprehensive Phase 3b program. Given the large number of studies being reported today, itwould be impossible to review the top-line results from each one on a single conference call. As a result, we will focus our prepared remarks onthe two COPD exacerbation studies and the asthma exacerbation study. Since the data disclosed from these studies only constitute a fraction of the overall dataset, I would like to note that both programs were designedto be evaluated in their entirety to formulate a complete view of the safety and effectiveness of Relovair and its components. I would also like tonote that, consistent with GSK communication policies, we are only announcing filing timeline and providing high-level results from these studiesat this time as GSK will be presenting full results from all the studies in the Phase 3 programs in future scientific forum. Now turning to the studies. I will be reviewing the two COPD studies.Then I will turn the call over to Mathai who will review the asthma study. NowI like you to turn to the next slide, Relovair with GSK Phase 3a in COPD. The two COPD exacerbation studies were double blind parallel group studies that each randomized approximately 1,620 patients with moderateto severe COPD. Patients received either vilanterol alone or one of three doses of Relovair. The studies were designed with a primary efficacyendpoint comparing the annual rate of moderate to severe exacerbations in patients receiving one of three doses of Relovair versus patientsreceiving vilanterol. In both studies Relovair at all doses demonstrated reductions in the annual rate of moderate to severe exacerbations compared with vilanterolalone. In the first study the reductions were statistically significant at all doses. At the 200/25 dose the p-value is 0.001, at the 100/25 microgramdose the p-value to 0.024, and at the 50/25 micrograms dose the p-value was 0.040.     In the second study the reductions were not statistically significant at the highest dose. The p-values in the study were p=0.109 at the 200/25microgram dose, p=0.001 at the 100/25 microgram dose, and p=0.181 for the 50/25 dose.The 50/25 dose demonstrated the smallest effect in bothstudies. All doses of Relovair in both studies demonstrated numerical increases in lung function compared with vilanterol, but not all increaseswere statistically significant. From a technical statistical perspective, the hierarchal testing plan limits strict statistical interpretation of the second study as the 200/25 microgramdose did not demonstrate statistical significance in the second study. Despite this, GSK and Theravance believe it is appropriate to request thatregulatory authorities review the totality of the exacerbation data. GSK believes that the overall weight of evidence from these studies, as well as the program overall, demonstrate that Relovair provided a reductionin COPD exacerbation rate at the 100/25 microgram dose for patients with moderate to severe COPD versus vilanterol alone. As a reminder, the efficacy of vilanterol as a bronchodilator was demonstrated in six-month studies that were announced in June.The 100/25 dosewill be the focus of GSK's global submission for COPD.The most common adverse events for patients receiving Relovair included nasal pharyngitis,upper respiratory tract infection, oral candidiasis, headache, COPD, back pain, pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis. GSK is investigating reports of fatal pneumonia on the Relovair arms, primarily at the 200/25 micrograms dose. Also, an integrated safety andtolerability analysis is underway to evaluate overall safety across the program. We are encouraged by the overall outcomes from the two Phase 3exacerbation studies and the dataset generated in the COPD program more broadly. Based upon these results, GSK again intends to commencethe global registration process with the 100/25 microgram dose of Relovair later this year. We have also seen some exciting data from the asthma exacerbation study, and I would now like to turn the call over to Mathai to discuss theresults of the asthma exacerbation study. Mathai?"

Please turn to the third slide after the Safe Harbor side. The asthma exacerbation study was the largest study in the asthma program and had treatment periods ranging up to 76 weeks. It was a double-blind,parallel group study that randomized approximately 2,000 patients -- 1,000 in each arm -- with moderate to severe asthma. Patients were randomizedone-to-one and received either 100 micrograms of FF alone or Relovair 100/25. This was an event-driven study with a primary efficacy endpoint comparing the time to persevere exacerbation for patients receiving Relovairversus patients receiving FF alone.That is, we are testing a hypothesis that the addition of vilanterol to FF provides value to the patient by reducingthe number of asthma exacerbations. We powered this study for superiority. A severe asthma exacerbation is defined here as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids for at least three days or aninpatient hospitalization or emergency department visit due to asthma that requires systemic corticosteroid. In addition to evaluating exacerbation,this study evaluated the contribution of vilanterol to the effectiveness of Relovair on lung function as a key secondary endpoint. We are pleased to report that this study demonstrated that patients receiving Relovair had statistically significant improvements in both time tofirst severe exacerbation with p-value of 0.036 and in the annual rate of severe exacerbations with a p-value of 0.014. This is an important findingand clearly shows the benefit of adding a long acting beta agonist to an inhaled corticosteroid on an important outcome measure like exacerbations. In addition, we are pleased to report that this study also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in lung function of 125 microgramsversus 100 micrograms of FF at all predefined time points over the 76-week period with a p-value less than 0.001.The most frequent adverse eventswere headache, nasal pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, cough or pharyngeal pain, and influenza.     There were no asthma-related deaths in this study. An integrated safety and tolerability analysis is underway to evaluate the overall safety acrossthe program. We are highly encouraged by the data from this Phase 3 asthma exacerbation study as well as the overall data set generated in the full asthmaprogram. Based upon these results, GSK intends to commence the EU registration process in mid-2012. In the US, GSK will continue discussionswith the FDA on regulatory requirements for a US asthma indication. I would like to now turn the call back over to Rick for a few closing remarks. Rick?"
4,18608689,THERAVANCE INC,01/09/2012,1:30PM,THRX,THERAVANCE INC GSK and Theravance Announce Initial Outcomesfrom Pivotal Phase III Studies for Once,Rick Winningham,"Theravance, Inc.",Chairman & CEO,False,True,False,"Thanks, Mathai.We believe that the totality of data across both the COPD and asthma programs support the plan to submit to regulatory agenciesfor mid-2012, a great step forward for Theravance and GSK. While we have only discussed three exacerbation studies during this call, today's release and the June release included results covering all but oneof the registration all programs. We are pleased to have reached this important milestone for Relovair. With one exception in the 12-week salmeterol VI asthma study, each study provides components necessary and supportive for the US EU filings.These data are quite new to us. We have seen top-line analysis and additional analyses are underway to support regulatory filings by GSK. Aspreviously noted, GSK will present more complete data sets at future scientific and medical meetings. Relovair is the lead program of our three late-stage respiratory programs with GSK. What is next in respiratory? The remaining Phase 3b programfor Relovair, some of which will be finished this year, and then the LAMA/LABA Phase 3 registrational program for COPD. Data from this LAMA/LABAPhase 3 program are projected to report before the end of 2012. The MABA Phase 2b clinical study was recently completed and we expect to update you in the near future. We believe that together these threeprograms have the potential to address the needs of a wide range of COPD and asthma patients suffering from debilitating disease. In addition to our programs with GSK, Theravance has a number of significant pipeline products that are being developed internally in a numberof therapeutic areas. We are excited about 2012 and look forward to bringing you further updates later this year. Now I would like to turn the call over to the conference facilitator and open the call for questions."

First question is really about the pneumonia cases. Can you tell a little bit moreabout those? How do they compare to similar pneumonia-adverse events in other trials? It's a generally [class phenomena], but did you have morethan were visible in other trials?"
7,18608689,THERAVANCE INC,01/09/2012,1:30PM,THRX,THERAVANCE INC GSK and Theravance Announce Initial Outcomesfrom Pivotal Phase III Studies for Once,Mathai Mammen,"Theravance, Inc.","SVP, Research and Early Clinical Development",True,False,False,This is Mathai. The data are relatively new to us so we are still in evaluation mode. What we are aware of right now were that we see no unusualincidence of pneumonia relative to other products. The fatal pneumonias that we reported were predominantly at the high dose.
8,18608689,THERAVANCE INC,01/09/2012,1:30PM,THRX,THERAVANCE INC GSK and Theravance Announce Initial Outcomesfrom Pivotal Phase III Studies for Once,Ronny Gal,Sanford Bernstein,Analyst,True,False,False,"Second question, regarding the [exacerbation] trials, do you actually meet the statistical requirements on the FPRP? Two exacerbation trials forsubmission essentially since your second trial, at least nominally failed. Is that -- does that not negate the entire program? Can you give us a littlebit more of your initial perspective here?"
9,18608689,THERAVANCE INC,01/09/2012,1:30PM,THRX,THERAVANCE INC GSK and Theravance Announce Initial Outcomesfrom Pivotal Phase III Studies for Once,Rick Winningham,"Theravance, Inc.",Chairman & CEO,True,False,False,"Sure and, no, I don't believe that it negates the entire program because of the strength of evidence around the effect, particularly at the 100/25microgram dose of Relovair. In the case of Relovair, we guessed that increasing the dose of the steroid would reduce exacerbations compared with vilanterol because of a, atthe time, relatively limited understanding of the drug effect. As the data indicate, the drug had a consistent effect across both studies in reductionand exacerbations being most predominant in both studies really at the 100/25 microgram dose. So I think we are quite confident in the exacerbationdata in the COPD studies."

11,18608689,THERAVANCE INC,01/09/2012,1:30PM,THRX,THERAVANCE INC GSK and Theravance Announce Initial Outcomesfrom Pivotal Phase III Studies for Once,Rick Winningham,"Theravance, Inc.",Chairman & CEO,True,False,False,"I am confident that the data support the reduction in exacerbations, and we will turn it in -- submit it to the FDA. But I believe that we have satisfieddemonstrating the contribution of the steroid to Relovair in the case of exacerbations."

And on asthma you seem to be more clear-cut about expectations for submission in Europe on asthma than you are in the United States.Can you explain to us how do you see the regulatory regimes as being different in the two geographies as they look in respect to the data?
13,18608689,THERAVANCE INC,01/09/2012,1:30PM,THRX,THERAVANCE INC GSK and Theravance Announce Initial Outcomesfrom Pivotal Phase III Studies for Once,Mike Aguiar,"Theravance, Inc.",SVP & CFO,True,False,False,"Sure, Ron this is Mike. I think the language you are seeing today reflects two things. One, we are quite excited about the results of the asthmaexacerbation study. We had hoped to see this data this is really terrific data and it's certainly something that gives GSK and Theravance moreconfidence overall. Now as you think about the specific question on the revelatory environment, we have been communicating for quite a period of time that as oftoday the regulatory path in Europe is a little clearer than that in the US. And so there is really no change in our guidance whatsoever where wehave been.     With regard to the US, as you probably know, when we started the program we had not received final signoff from the FDA on the Phase 3 programhere. And as of today we still haven't received a final sign-off on exactly what it's going to take to get regulatory approval in the US. And so that isreally -- the language you see in the press release is reflecting that. I think we feel pretty good about the overall package and we are going to have discussions with the FDA and we will see where we end up. But,again, there is really no change whatsoever in the regulatory guidance, but I think again we feel quite good about the results of the asthmaexacerbation study."

First, on the COPD side just obvious questions. Why the difference in the two trial outcomes? I don't know if there were initialthoughts on why the highest dose did not show significance in the second trial. Geographic differences have you looked at baseline characteristics? Is there anything you can point to which led to the different outcomes?"
17,18608689,THERAVANCE INC,01/09/2012,1:30PM,THRX,THERAVANCE INC GSK and Theravance Announce Initial Outcomesfrom Pivotal Phase III Studies for Once,Rick Winningham,"Theravance, Inc.",Chairman & CEO,True,False,False,"At this time, Ian, there is nothing I can really point to. These are all very, very top-line data. I would just say in terms, I think we believe that the twostudies actually are very consistent, particularly around the -- at the 100/25 microgram dose. Each study showed reductions in exacerbations and it was more profound across both studies in the 100/25 microgram dose. I would just like togo back that in this case we guessed that increasing the dose of the steroid would result in a reduction in exacerbations compared with vilanterol. Keep in mind that this is an active controlled study. Because of a limited understanding of really the drug affect and in fact whether there wouldbe a dose response to reduction in exacerbations related to be steroid. We didn't see it here, but I think that in no way diminishes our confidencearound the 100/25 dose of vilanterol and reduction in exacerbations."
18,18608689,THERAVANCE INC,01/09/2012,1:30PM,THRX,THERAVANCE INC GSK and Theravance Announce Initial Outcomesfrom Pivotal Phase III Studies for Once,Mathai Mammen,"Theravance, Inc.","SVP, Research and Early Clinical Development",True,False,False,"Ian, I think you guys can certainly appreciate this is an extremely large and robust database and there will be work going on at GSK and Theravanceto understand this for quite a period of time. We, literally, have only had this data for a couple of days here. As consistent with our practice, we getit out extremely quickly at the top level. So there will be a lot of work being done, particularly at GSK, going back, looking at the data in very, very deep level of detail, adjudicating thevarious cases as required, etc. And so we will be continuing to inform our understanding of this data as we go forward, but as of today, given therapidity with which we are bringing the information to you folks, we don't have quite that level of detail yet. I think I would probably point you tothe upcoming scientific conferences when we present the full data set as the likely time when we will have additional information."

I was hoping to get a comment on the lung function data.That seems like the second time you have very carefully crafted the statementsrelated to the benefit shown on lung function. Can you just help us compare the 12-month data to the six-month data in terms of FEV1 benefit? Was it seen at the predefined time point at theend of the study? Was it seen at any time point during the trial in terms of reaching statistical significance and at what doses?
20,18608689,THERAVANCE INC,01/09/2012,1:30PM,THRX,THERAVANCE INC GSK and Theravance Announce Initial Outcomesfrom Pivotal Phase III Studies for Once,Rick Winningham,"Theravance, Inc.",Chairman & CEO,True,False,False,"I think overall the improvement in lung function as measured by increase in FEV1 by the steroid component of Relovair is consistent now acrossfour different studies and three different doses of the steroid. I think we -- while in both instances we had observations of statistical significanceat specific doses, they -- all changes were in the same direction and they were consistent with what has been seen historically with the administrationof a steroid and its impact on lung function in COPD patients. So I would just say that this provides yet another dataset with regard to the impact on lung function of the steroid. It's less than -- the impact ofthe steroid is less than the impact of vilanterol but it is additive to the effect of vilanterol."

Mathai?"

And that is the exacerbation study. The lung function affects of the steroid across all the studies that Rick mentioned were exactly in line with what steroids have done historically inother LABA/ICS product. In this particular exacerbation study in 12 months, as we disclosed, some of those numbers, even though consistent acrossboth studies, were statistically significant and other ones or not."

And just one last question, maybe just bigger picture. Just from the regulatory viewpoint are there -- is the focus going to defer the FDAversus the EMEA in terms of the endpoint exacerbation versus lung function? Just what will they put greater weight on and what gives youconfidence that the data will lead to a positive outcome?"
25,18608689,THERAVANCE INC,01/09/2012,1:30PM,THRX,THERAVANCE INC GSK and Theravance Announce Initial Outcomesfrom Pivotal Phase III Studies for Once,Rick Winningham,"Theravance, Inc.",Chairman & CEO,True,False,False,"Well, I think that the regulatory authorities around the world today generally view that, as Mathai stated, that the role of the steroid is to reduceinflammation and reduce the potential for exacerbations. There is an effect on lung function. It is less than the affect, on a relative scale, thanVilanterol.     But I think, clearly, the data that we see from the two exacerbation studies give us and GSK confidence with the regulatory filings in both Europeand the United States. Mathai, would you like to add something?"

I think that it's exactly as you said. In Europe there is an explicit statement that steroids, the role of steroids is forexacerbations period. In the US it's likely that they will look at everything, including the lung function changes. But as we have said just a minuteago, the data on lung function for the steroid is in fact consistent across the program."

Can you -- just going back to the fatal pneumonia cases, can you say how many cases were there at each dose? And I think typically you dosee an increase of pneumonia in general in the combination. In this case is there a greater increase of all ammonia cases for the combo versus LABAas compared to Advair, for example?"

It's a known risk with patients in an ICS/LABA class. Thereare reports of pneumonia in COPD patients who have died receiving products other than ICS/LABAs as well as ICS/LABAs historically. I think it's too soon to compare with previous experience. However, overall the rates of pneumonia are very consistent with historical experience.We called out in the press release the dose of the 200/25 where the fatal pneumonias occurred. If we had a concern about other doses in theprogram, a specific concern, we certainly would have called those out in the release."

Do you have any available information on the number of the exacerbations in the two exacerbation trials?

Because I think if you look across the programs and you look at the studies that were initiated in 2010and 2011, what you see is that the predominant dose used in the studies were the 100/25 microgram dose of Relovair. It was our overall expectation,I believe, going in that the most frequent -- most frequently used dose of this product, if approved and marketed, would be at the 100/25 dose,which is why we have studied that dose of 100/25 more than any other dose in the program."

So I don't think we were hugely outside of what we considered possibilities. Again, I don't want to get into very specific numbers. But at the end of the day we have these two studies here that had a consistent reduction in exacerbations across all groups. We had one studywhere every group was statistically significant and so again things fell kind of broadly within that, but I wouldn't want to get to very specifics aboutreversibility or things like that at this particular juncture.

And then obviously I think the emphasis here seems to be on COPD data, just given the fact that that appears to be the most well-definedregulatory path, at least here in the US. But I am just wondering as you kind of look at the asthma data -- and I know that there was some discussionas to kind of when and how you guys would pursue a filing in the US. But do you really see anything in the asthma data that kind of exceeded your expectations? And do you kind of expect that to meaningfully impactthe path and the pace at which GSK decides to pursue a filing, at least here in the US?"

I am just going to reiterate how pleased we were with the outcome of the asthma exacerbation study. This was a very, very large study 2,000patients, 1,000 in each arm. Very clear statistical benefit on exacerbations and FEV1. FEV1, literally, at every time point looked quite good.     So if you were to ask me what was, I think, my personal biggest surprise on the upside here in this study it was the results from this particular one.So that really I think has given us a fair amount of confidence that we have now statistically shown in a very large study that the addition of thebeta agonist to a steroid reduced the overall rates of exasperation and it proved FEV1 in patients with asthma. So I think we were quite pleasedabout that. Rick, do you want --?"

Clearly there was concern in some camps that theaddition of a beta agonist to a steroid would increase the rates of asthma exacerbations. We didn't see that. We saw in this study 2,000 patients that the addition of a beta agonist to a steroid reduces exacerbations across a couple ofdifferent parameters and provides consistently superior lung function to those patients. So I am very, very pleased with the outcome of the asthmaexacerbation study."

Firstly, very quickly, when will we see the data? Will you be able to make ATS? And then, secondly, can you just helpus understand how regulators might interpret these pivotal studies when both the active and the comparator are unlicensed medications?"
54,18608689,THERAVANCE INC,01/09/2012,1:30PM,THRX,THERAVANCE INC GSK and Theravance Announce Initial Outcomesfrom Pivotal Phase III Studies for Once,Rick Winningham,"Theravance, Inc.",Chairman & CEO,True,False,False,"Sure. On your first question, will we make ATS no, I don't think we will make ATS. I think we are committed with GSK to get this data out in frontof the medical and scientific community just as soon as we can but we won't be able to make ATS. Relative to your second question and the expectations, I mean clearly the scope and the size of the asthma and COPD program here for an initialregistration package are unparalleled. As I said in my remarks and as Mathai reiterated, each of these studies provides a level of contribution to theoverall package. So the COPD exacerbation data clearly, at least in our mind, show that at the 100/25 microgram dose there is a benefit to reductionin exacerbations in COPD patients. We have already shown that vilanterol in COPD patients is a highly statistically significant bronchodilator. We have also shown that Relovair, as acombination product, is highly statistically significant bronchodilator. Turning to the asthma program and how the strength of evidence really of the asthma program, we talked about the exacerbation study so I won'tcover that again. The moderate to severe study in asthma, a 24-week study, statistically significant contribution here from the product and animprovement in FEV1 of the combination over 200 microgram dose of the FF and trough FEV1 and weighted mean FEV1.     That is an important outcome for us because also in the study the FF 200 microgram dose dosed once daily was non- inferior to fluticasonepropionate. That is another important element of the registrational package. While the 12-week placebo-controlled study evaluating lung function in mild to moderate asthmatics didn't demonstrate an improvement of thecombination over the single agent steroid, importantly it did demonstrate a statistically significant improvement over placebo for the steroid. Andthen I think the safety data, large safety, 12-month safety study in asthmatics supports both the asthma and the COPD programs. Then just closing off, with the two comparator studies -- one in asthma, one in COPD -- versus Seretide, while in these initial studies we did not seesuperiority of Relovair versus Seretide what we did see was a comparable impact on FEV1 between Relovair and Seretide, which I think is alsosomewhat supportive from a regulatory process. I think overall GSK really has designed a very comprehensive Phase 3 program that should bewell received by regulators."

I am not going to get it to the very specifics of regulatory interactions, but clearly GSKdesigned these programs after consultations with the regulators and clearly these consultations contemplated these were brand-new productsand these were unapproved products. So I would just say that I think GSK has done a thorough job on that and the programs are designed withthe view these were unapproved products at this point."

A couple of questions, please. Clearly there have been background concerns about the safety of ICS administration in COPD patients with regards to pneumonia, albeit non-fatal.This additional trial data suggests that it may be indeed a material issue, dose dependent or not. In addition, as you have obviously admitted andshown in the data, LABAs are very effective in monotherapy in the disease. My point being that looking at the totality of the data you could argue that perhaps LABA/LAMA increasingly might look like the gold standard formanagement of COPD. So with that in mind, given your recent initiation of a lower dosage trial for the LAMA component of your LABA/LAMA,could you just restate your confidence that in fact GSK and Theravance have selected the optimal doses, in particular of the LAMA, to ensure USregulatory approval? So that is the first question. There is a short second one which is to provide some further information on the scale and duration of the real-worldoutcome trials that you alluded to."

First of all, with your perspective on LABA/ICS I think clearly the role of LABA/ICSgoing forward in COPD is around exacerbations and the reduction in rate of exacerbations. It's critically important, as it is with any drug that is     developed, to get the dose right in treating those patients. And that is clearly what we have attempted to do with these two very large COPDexacerbation studies, and I believe we have done that. I think you bring up an excellent point with regard to LAMA/LABA because in the -- with the LABA/ICS you have one bronchodilator plus ananti-inflammatory medicine, whereas the LAMA/LABA program combines two bronchodilators. And I think we are very excited about the potentialof bringing both type of products to patients. Mike?"

So just to close out on the LABA/ICS, again I think we have quite a bit of confidence where we are today. Now with regard to the LAMA/LABA. This is a very important asset to both Theravance and GSK. I think Theravance's view is that going forwardthis will have a larger proportion of the market today. I think LAMAs are going to have an increasing role in COPD. The LAMA/LABA in particular isa very well-positioned asset, as Rick had mentioned. Now going to your specific question, we have taken two doses forward the [62.5] and the 100/25. Based upon where we are today we think the100/25 is the most likely. We sort of took the 62.5 into the studies as a belt and suspenders. You are correct, we do have another study that isongoing and that data will continue to inform our opinion. But I think based upon the totality of the data that GSK generated up to this point we feel quite good about the 100/25 and the 62.5. Obviously,we will need to get to the finish line for that, but I think today we feel quite good about that. Mathai?"
63,18608689,THERAVANCE INC,01/09/2012,1:30PM,THRX,THERAVANCE INC GSK and Theravance Announce Initial Outcomesfrom Pivotal Phase III Studies for Once,Mathai Mammen,"Theravance, Inc.","SVP, Research and Early Clinical Development",True,False,False,"Yes, thanks. I want to reiterate that there are going to be a group of patients that have exacerbations, that have inflammation in their lungs withCOPD where they are best treated with a LABA/ICS product. So that is going to be a very important product for a large subset of patients withCOPD. And we are equally excited about patients that don't need that anti-inflammatory that need excellent bronchodilation. So there we have -- theLAMA/LABA program in collaboration with GSK is exciting. And with respect to doses, first on the LABA/ICS. It is important there to get the ICS dose exactly right. You need it to be high enough that it doesin fact control exacerbations. As a reminder, the 50 dose was the least effective dose in both our exacerbations studies, so it needs to be north of 50. And it can't be so high thatit causes its own issues. So there was a lot of confidence around the 100/25 dose on the heels of the study just reported.     And on the LAMA/LABA side, the LABA dose is of course fixed at 25 micrograms. As Mike said, there is no change in confidence.We remain confidentthat the two doses selected for the Phase 3 study are right, and until the data comment that are from the low-dose study there is no reason tochange that level of confidence. The 100/25, as a reminder, looked a tad better to us than the 62.5, and the 62.5 was taken into Phase 3 as a risk mitigation strategy."
