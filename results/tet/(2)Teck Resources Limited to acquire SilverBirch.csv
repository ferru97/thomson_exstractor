I just wanted to go over the regulatory approvals. I did see that you're expecting this deal to closekind of mid April, so just was wondering if you could go over that timeline? I did see here that you got some shareholders to support this transaction,so maybe if you could just talk about the background and how you came to this transaction? I missed the first part of the call, so I apologize if youdiscussed this already."

Yes, there's 39% of the shareholders, well that's basically Management's and the two major shareholders have already locked up to the deal.As far as how the deal came together, I'm not quite sure on your question, but I'm assuming -- are you talking about timeline or --"

8,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,"Okay, I understand that. Actually no, we've been through a long strategic process almost, actually we are pretty well 12 months now. Once SilverBirchwas formed October 2010, we basically got up and running, got settled in. And then starting in January 2011, we formed an informal strategicworking group of some of the members of the Board with also our financial advisors joined the team as well. And we basically look at the strategicoptions for the Company, understanding the assets that we had. Now of course at that time, we didn't have any results from our Audet drillingprogram, so we didn't know the scale of the opportunity. So during the first sort of three or four months of that strategic process, we were assessingour assets and then getting to understand what we had on the Audet property. So by sort of mid-year, we had some additional information.We had a pretty good understanding of the scale of the opportunity at Audet.We alsohad completion of the design basis memorandum, we had the resource update from Frontier and Equinox. And probably the key factor was in endof June, we had the revised capital cost estimates for the Frontier and Equinox projects. So again, with those bits of information, we were able to     get a pretty good handle on the potential economics of Frontier and Equinox as well as what the capital quantum that would be required fromSilverBirch to stay in the project at 50/50. Now of course all along we had always said at SilverBirch that at some point we would look at our options for how great our participation in theproject would be, in the Frontier and Equinox project, and that we'd be quite open to constructive ways to reduce our interest as long as it createdvalue for the shareholders. Now the financial advisors also conducted a confidential low-key process of contacting potential participants who mightbe willing to either participate with us, buy our share, any number of the normal kind of things you would consider and that was quite extensive,it was international, but it wasn't a public process. At the same time, commencing in about the mid-summer, we also started negotiations with Teck on our partnership agreement. And that hadbeen a long-standing commitment between both ourselves and Teck, was to form a partnership and properly paper it with a partnership agreement.Through that process, we had to examine value, both parties examine value, and we are looking at ways to make a good agreement, having learneda lot from our participation also with Teck in the Fort Hills agreement and recognizing that there were a few things in that agreement that hadn'tworked well for a junior partner, particularly during a financial crisis. So we wanted to come up with a similar partnership agreement but something that provided flexibility for the smaller Company, i.e. SilverBirch.And we work hard with Teck to put that kind of agreement together, and actually had something that we could put in front of our Boards, andultimately then just two days before Christmas, Teck came back with the offer that we're looking at now rather than proceed with the partnershipapproach. So really it was quite a long process, talked to either ourselves or our partners, talked to a lot of different parties over that interveningperiod and finally came to what we believe now is the offer we have in front-- a good offer that we have in front of us now."

And then just as a kind of what regulatory approvals and then kind of a potential timeline between now and kind of mid-April, I thinkthat's when you're expecting the deal to close on or before mid-April?"

So I mean you know how it works once we mailthe circular the clock starts ticking, but because we are starting SilverWillow, the circular will have a lot of information in it about the new Company,so that will take some time. So we're still aiming sort of for that end of March/early April closing timeframe."

I just have two questions for you Howard. First of all, is there any follow up lockup to shareholders post closing of thistransaction?"
22,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,I will ask Jina to answer that one.

25,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Jina Abells Morissette,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,VP,True,False,False,"No, it doesn't carry on into SilverWillow."

27,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,"Yes, the-- it was really just a negotiation. We weren't-- we as SilverBirch didn't feel strongly about keeping Twin Lakes, our view on the geologicalpotential, is that it's probably limited but obviously that is SilverBirch's view and that's only subject to the limited drilling that has been done todate. Teck was interested in keeping Twin Lakes, so it was easy for us to make that swap of those lands."
28,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Mark Friesen,RBC Capital Markets,Analyst,True,False,False,Sure. Is that a read through that that's possibly a mining opportunity?
29,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,"It's-- no I wouldn't say it is or and it isn't a mining opportunity, but it's certainly if there is going to be oil sand there, it would be at depths that wouldbe more likely a mineable prospect that an in situ prospect just because of the depth of the geology in that area."

Wayne is sitting here, I will ask them to talk about that. There's not a whole lot about-- can be said about it I don'tthink."
32,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Wayne Bobye,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"VP, CFO",True,False,False,"No Mark, it's just a regular loan. It's very similar to the one that we have in place now. It's put in place to provide flexibility. The rate on it is verycompetitive with what we have now related to prime. And it's just put in place so that we have some flexibility going forward because we were--if we hadn't done this transaction, we probably would've had to raise some equity, so this gives us some flexibility to move forward with our capitalspending program."

35,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Mark Friesen,RBC Capital Markets,Analyst,True,False,False,"Sure. Okay, great. Thanks very much."

Just two questions. Just to clarify the loan facility, so the intent is that when the transaction closes, you'll usethe CAD25 million working capital funding in part to repay that facility?"
39,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,"Yes, but there is CAD24 million cash in SilverBirch right now. We'll also have proceeds from exercise of options, which we estimate up to now willbe about CAD22 million to SilverBirch. So that actually in the time period between now and closing, by our calculations, gives us sufficient cash tomeet current obligations and the first three months of drilling in 2012. So by closing, SilverBirch's working capital will be essentially zero. And theCAD25 million that will be contributed by Teck will go into SilverWillow. Now as Wayne said, the CAD20 million loan provides us the flexibility because obviously the proceeds from the exercise of options will only comein at closing, and so if there's a shortfall on cash just due to timing reasons, because drilling programs tend to be quite financially intense if youspend a lot of money in a hurry and the bills come in very quickly. So we're just assuming that there may be a cash shortfall and that's really whatthe loan will be used for so that in theory by closing, we should have most of the CAD25 million intact once we start at SilverWillow."

And just a question on the timing. SilverWillow is being listed, do you expect that it'll-- that it's listing will becoincident with the closing of the transaction? Or is it possible we might see the plan of arrangement close and then a few weeks later the SilverWillowstart to trade?"

Are the Twin Lakes areas an area that was contemplated potentially as a gift to the province forenvironmental park or recreation area?
49,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,"Well that's an interesting idea. There's been discussion of that kind of thing from time to time but nothing ever followed up on. I think there isactually -- if you look at it John, all that SilverBirch and Teck had on there was the oil sands leases, we don't have any rights to the surface. But howTeck will make use of this land obviously is a question for Teck."

Lease was already sold to Imperial."

54,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,John Tumazos,John Tumazos Very Independent Research,Analyst,True,False,False,"The apparent price in terms of cash, I'm calculating is the 435 cash plus the CAD25 million working capital or 460 divided by 1.4 billion barrels, orCAD0.33 a barrel. And that's less than the CAD2 apparent price at the time at a lower oil price for the 20% of Fort Hills sold to Total. Now admittedlyit's not exactly apples and oranges, because the degree of engineering and permitting and preliminary construction isn't the same, but could youtalk to the six-fold difference in valuation and why you're embracing selling Frontier Equinox at one-sixth of the terms or even if you made anadjustment for the difference in phase one-third of the terms?"
55,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,"Yes. No, I think that one's one we could certainly respond to. If you look, we-- the number we use is about CAD0.34 a barrel, so agree with yourcalculation, we come to the number slightly differently, but it's essentially CAD0.34 a barrel. This-- if you think of Frontier and Equinox, it's veryearly stage, we don't have any regulatory approval at this pace, at this point. We've literally just submitted the application, or a least Teck had, atthe end of the year last year. And where as Fort Hills had had regulatory approval in place by the time we exited that project eight years, and CAD2.8billion had been spent by the partners. In addition, UTS had an earn in right so there was additional value in Fort Hills from the earn in. So when you compare the metrics, it is quite a different transaction. Also keep in mind that Frontier and Equinox will not commence productionuntil about 2020 or 2021. And the issue that was facing SilverBirch that even prior to sanction, the partnership would have to spend CAD300 millionto CAD500 million just to get to sanction, so that's over the next three to four years. And we recognized that for us, that would be quite dilutivewith the equity we would raise, be quite dilutive for SilverBirch shareholders and that the offer finally made by Teck seemed to be quite fair andquite reasonable and that was why we made that decision to proceed."
56,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,John Tumazos,John Tumazos Very Independent Research,Analyst,True,False,False,"If I could be so tedious with one more question.The calculation of CAD0.34 a barrel is only the cash consideration.There is the much more difficultquestion of valuing the in situ assets or in situ potential assets that Teck is swapping with you in addition to the cash consideration. Did you assessonly the cash consideration in avoidance of dilution or did you assign value to the in situ assets were the documentation and the potential recoveryrates, the existence of the bitumen and recover ability of the bitumen require I guess a greater standard of documentation because they're deeperet cetera?"
57,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,"Of course the potential value of the lands played into our consideration. Because obviously we are quite optimistic about the potential of bothAudet and Birch Mountains. As far as formally assigning value, we basically for our own the calculation purposes just use the book values whichprovides quite a modest amount of value. I believe by closing our book value in those various properties will be about CAD90 million. So a littleover, what's that CAD1.80 a share roughly for the book value going into SilverWillow. Now obviously how the market values that we'll get to seein the next few days, but so it was in our calculations from the point of view of establishing total value. But as far as the metrics we've referenced,we've only referenced the cash component, John."

I guess first question is just a follow up on your comments about the book value of the assets in SilverWillow, is thatCAD90 million, Howard, is that outside of the CAD25 million in working capital?"

We-- some of that working capital-- some of that book value is dependent on what we spend at Audet in the firstthree months and then if you basically sort of notionally cut off at the end of March, what we've spent on Audet will count in that book valuecalculation."

And then I just thought I'd ask, I'm not sure what you can comment on it on, but you mentioned potentially other recoverytechniques at Audet should the cap rock not prove sufficient, can you talk about what you're thinking there?"
67,18609117,TECK RESOURCES LTD,01/09/2012,2:00PM,TCK.B.TO,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Howard Lutley,SilverBirch Energy Corporation,"President, CEO",True,False,False,"Yes, what-- so the way we're looking at it right now and we've got a bit of modeling work going on with an engineering company that should becompleted sometime in the next two or three months, is we're looking at it as a conventional SAGD. And I think as we've mentioned in previouscalls, that we did have-- we did find some pretty extensive occurrences of what we believe will be a suitable cap rock material. But what we don't     know is how extensive. So our opening position is if we can prove up this cap rock materials existence in a big enough area and the modeling andthe testing and the many frac tests show that it's sufficient for conventional SAGD, and I wouldn't call it a low pressure, I'd call it sort of a moderatepressure SAGD, then that's basically a conventional approach. So that if we find that that wouldn't necessarily be technically feasible, we would then look at other SAGD related approaches maybe with solventassist or low pressure SAGD as is being tried out in other places. And then a further fallback would be some of the new techniques that some ofthe other companies have been talking about, perhaps with some of the electrical or other solvent assist type techniques. But certainly our focuswill for Audet be on conventional SAGD as the first case."

And have you been in touch with the regulator on what I guess their current thinking is about cap rock and I'm not sure if there is any -- ifthey're getting any more stringent with regards to testing over the past couple of years on that, but just comment on that?"

And of course,Sproule our other advisor, has been involved with a number of applications. So we are reasonably aware from the consultants of the regulatoryrequirements. We recognize that there is a bit of a work in progress on how that will evolve over the next 12 to 24 months. But we're certainlytaking an approach that is relatively conservative as we consider what the operating pressures would be as we do in the current modeling. And ofcourse the current modeling is really just an early scoping study just to try and understand what the potential will be, there'll be further rounds ofengineering once we have the many frac tests, the rest of the data from the geotechnical program and of course more resource data."
