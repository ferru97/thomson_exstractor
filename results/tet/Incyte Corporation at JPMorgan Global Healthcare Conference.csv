My name is Cory Kasimov. I'm a senior biotech analyst at JPMorgan, and let me also extend my will comewelcome to you all here for the 30th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. Our next Company to present this morning is Incyte Corporation. A very exciting time for Incyte with the recent approval and now launch of theCompany's first product, Jakafi. Here to tell us much more about the story and the launch is the Company's President and CEO, Paul Friedman. Andplease note that following Paul's presentation there will be a breakout session down the hall to the left in the Olympic room. So with that, I willturn it over to Paul."
1,18608865,INCYTE CORP,01/09/2012,4:30PM,INCY,Incyte Corporation at JPMorgan Global Healthcare Conference,Paul Friedman,Incyte Corporation,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Thanks, Cory. Good morning everyone. Please note that Safe Harbor rules govern my remarks and forward-looking statements, and we ask thatyou review our latest SEC filings including our most recent 10-Q for a summary of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materiallyfrom any forward-looking statements. We hope that's not the case. The approval by FDA in November of our first JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, Jakafi, for the treatment of intermediate to high risk myelofibrosis wasobviously very important and highly gratifying to all of us at Incyte. Immediately following this anticipated approval, and after rigorous andsystematic preparation, our experienced marketing and sales teams launched an intensive commercial effort to reach physicians, other healthcareprofessionals, payers, patients and patient advocacy groups. While I'm going to describe the launch in greater detail later in the presentation, I cantell you that it is going well. Beyond the launch, we have studied and are studying Jakafi in a number of other indications that could add to its therapeutic and commercialvalue. Most advanced is the clinical development of Jakafi in polycythemia vera, another MPN. PV patients can exhibit the signs and symptomssimilar to those of myelofibrosis, and our Phase 2 results indicate that Jakafi is very effective in reducing disease burden in patients with PV. A global Phase 3 study, pivotal study, conducted under an SPA in collaboration with Novartis is underway and on track to complete next year. Keyprograms with two of our strategic collaborators, Novartis and Lilly, are progressing well. In addition to the Phase 3 PV trial, in June of 2011 Novartisfiled the MAA for Jakafi for myelofibrosis and expects to begin commercializing Jakafi outside the US later this year. Lilly is advancing our second JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis and now another indication, moderate to severe psoriasis. I'm notgoing to have time to describe some of our earlier stage development or discovery programs, but I want to convey that I'm confident in the skilland the proven productivity of Incyte's research team. Jakafi is an important first medicine, but it's only the beginning. We remain in a strong financial position, having ended the third quarter of 2011 with total cash of $317 million. That doesn't include $28.5 millionheld in escrow for interest payments through 2012 on our convertible senior notes. Our cash use guidance for last year is $185 million to $200million, and that doesn't include milestones from partners, nor proceeds from stock option exercises.     Our proposal to amend entry criteria and reduce the size of the study was accepted.The trial now involves 200 randomized -- patients randomized1 to 1 to ruxolitinib versus best available therapy. And we continue to expect the study to complete in 2013 and to obtain FDA approval of thesNDA in 2014. We've also -- we're also conducting a Phase 2b trial with pancreatic cancer. This is an area of high therapeutic need, as evidenced by the relativelack of efficacy with existing agents. In preclinical models of pancreatic cancer, Jakafi works well. In addition, since there's a high incidence ofcachexia in this patient group, we think our very positive effects on cachexia in MF have the potential to be carried over to pancreatic cancer, sincecytokine over-signaling and hyper catabolism are thought to play major roles in solid tumor cachexia as well. RECAP is actually enrolling patients and has the potential to generate topline results in 2013. Our other strategic alliance is with Lilly. Lilly has worldwide rights to our second JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor for all chronic inflammatory diseases. Andas Lilly will describe in its presentation, the Phase 2b trial and rheumatoid arthritis patients will complete in 2012 and is expected to result in publicdisclosures possibly at EULAR and/or at ACR.While the final decisions depend on the not-yet-seen Phase 2b data, plans for Phase 3 are well underwayand we expect the Phase 3 program will start later this year. Prior to the initiation of the Phase 2b trial, we exercised our co-development option for RA. This means we are now responsible for funding 30%of the associated future development costs for this indication. This increase is our tiered royalties up to the high [20s]. Lilly recently began a 240 patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose ranging study 248 or 10 milligrams once a day to explorethe efficacy and safety of the JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor in adults with moderate to severe psoriasis.The primary objective is to demonstrate superiorityto placebo at week 12 as measured by the proportion of patients with at least a 75% improvement from baseline in their PASI score. And while itis obviously dependent on enrollment and could change, currently we expect to see data for the primary endpoint in the first half of 2013. So, to conclude, 2011 has obviously been a pivotal watershed year for Incyte with the approval of our first product, Jakafi, for the treatment of MFand its steady advancement in other indications. Our second JAK inhibitor for chronic inflammatory diseases is also progressing well with Lilly, andwe look forward to seeing a third indication selected with clinical evaluation beginning in 2012. Beyond the JAK inhibitors, our early stage oncology programs for c-Met and IDO inhibitors are ongoing. These both look very promising and areexpected to move into Phase 2 trials this year. We have several new proprietary programs in oncology and inflammation that I look forward to describing once there is meaningful Phase 2 datato report. Given the knowledge, skill and productivity of our research and development teams, I'm confident you will see other important medicinescoming from Incyte in the future. I thank you for your attention and look forward to seeing some of you in the breakout session."
