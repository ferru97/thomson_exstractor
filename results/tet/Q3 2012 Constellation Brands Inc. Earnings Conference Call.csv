Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Thanks, Patty. Good morning, and happy new year to everyone. I hope you all had a great holiday, and the opportunity to enjoy some of our fineproducts throughout the season. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2012 sales and earnings results. We continued to progress through the year withresults that are generally in line with our expectations for most areas of the business. I'm especially pleased with our significantly improved consolidated margin structure, and our continued progress in the area of free cash flowgeneration, which has essentially enabled us to fund our share repurchase efforts, where we have already completed more than 50% of our currentauthorization. Our top line performance for the quarter was not surprising, as we continued to lap last year's third-quarter US distributor inventory build. As areminder, our shipments to distributors last year exceeded distributors' sales to retail as part of our US distributor transition initiative. This had theeffect of benefiting our sales and profits for fiscal 2011, but created a sales and EBIT comparison challenge for fiscal 2012. Now, despite these sales trends, our US wine and spirits depletions improved sequentially during the third quarter, with the entire portfolio growingalmost 2%, and focus brands growing about 6%. As previously discussed, we expected our depletion trends to improve as we progressed throughthe year due to the gating of the promotional spend for our US wine and spirits businesses. This year, we are driving enhanced promotional and merchandising activity in the second half to better align with the seasonality of our business.As such, you can see in the IRI data coinciding with our third quarter, that we gained volume share for total table wine and the premium plussegment, which represents the greater than $5 retail price point. This channel accounts for about 35% of our business. And our spirit sales remainrobust as we gained share, driven by our SVEDKA vodka brand. However, growth for our total US wine portfolio continues to lag that of the overall US wine category on a year-to-date basis through the thirdquarter. Our US wine share loss for this time period can be primarily attributed to a decline in value brands below the $5 retail price point, as weincreased net prices for some of our higher volume value brands, such as Vendange and Arbor Mist. As would be expected, this action negativelyimpacted volumes, but to a bit greater degree than we originally anticipated. So, what are we doing about this market share issue? We are in the process of revamping up innovation and new product development, where wecurrently have more than 20 new product launches underway in fiscal 2012, many of which are included in hot categories that are experiencingsignificant growth. We currently have strong momentum for many of our newly launched products, like Primal Roots, a sweet red blend, Rex Goliath Moscato, RuffinoProsecco, Woodbridge Malbec, and the Simply Naked unoaked line of varietals. Our most recent introduction to the new product line-up is the Dreaming Tree brand a collaboration between Steve Reeder, our award-winningwinemaker at Simi, and acclaimed musician Dave Matthews, that is receiving rave reviews. This collection of new products is gaining traction, and performed very well in the marketplace during the holiday selling season. And next year,in fiscal 2013, we expect to have an increasing percentage of our sales growth coming from innovation. As I mentioned earlier, from a depletion perspective, during the third quarter our focus brands grew almost 6%, with several brands growing doubledigits, including SVEDKA vodka, Black Box, Rex-Goliath, and Kim Crawford, just to name a few. However, the previously mentioned price increase on Arbor Mist has reduced our Focus brands' growth rate somewhat. To mitigate this, we haveintroduced Arbor Mist Pomegranate Berry Pinot Noir, which is doing very well in the marketplace, and we recently launched Arbor Mist StrawberryMoscato at Walmart.     Throughout calendar 2011, Crown achieved several milestones, and has received recognition from some of the most notable beer and marketingchannels in the industry, including the following.This is the first year that Crown Imports has been named to Advertising Age's prestigious MarketerA list. This is the second consecutive year that Corona Extra has been named one of the best global brands by Interbrand. Modelo Especial won an ImpactHot Brands award, and an Impact Blue Chip Award, with Corona Light winning a Blue Chip Award from Impact as well. Modelo Especial and Victoriaeach received Cheers growth brand awards, and Victoria also received a Market Watch Leader's Choice award in the best new product segment.These awards highlight the continuing success of the brand portfolio, and underscore Crown's unique approach to marketing. Overall, calendar 2011 was the largest volume year for the collection of Modelo brands in the US. Throughout the remainder of the year, Crown isfocused on market execution, and optimizing promotional and marketing initiatives. Some examples include the continued expansion of the Corona Familiar 32-ounce bottle, primarily in Mexican and Hispanic markets throughoutthe US. Launched in the US in calendar 2010, Corona Familiar had strong depletions in calendar 2011. Victoria will expand to select cities withinthose states where it is already available. In addition, new packaging configurations are being introduced for the brands in existing markets. Victoria already ranks as a top import, and islarger than many national distributed competitors in the import category. Crown continues to expand its draft offerings for the Pacifico, Negra Modelo, Modelo Especial, and Victoria brands, which are doing extremely wellin existing markets. Year to date through the third quarter, Crown's depletions for its draft offerings increased 60% versus the same period lastyear. Now, in closing, we believe we are in good shape to deliver our financial objectives for the year. Even though we may fall a bit short of our depletiongoals for our US wine business, we have solid promotional programs in place designed to drive continued improvement in these trends throughoutthe remainder of the year. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for our financial discussion of our third quarter business results."
3,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,False,True,False,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. The quarter came in essentially in line with our Q2 earnings call discussion. Our free cash flow is runningahead of expectations, and we've increased our free cash flow guidance for the year. As it relates to earnings guidance for the year, we're maintaining our comparable-basis EPS goal of $2 to $2.10 provided at Q2, which is essentiallythe guidance provided at the beginning of the year, exclusive of the benefits from reduced shares and reduced tax rates. For Q3, our comparable-basis diluted EPS came in at $0.50, versus $0.66 last year. The majority of the EPS decrease was driven by a 17% decline incomparable-basis EBIT.This EBIT result was in line with the expectations we outlined last quarter, and was driven primarily by three items, all relatedto overlaps of events which occurred in fiscal 2011. These include the overlap of the Q3 fiscal 2011 distributor inventory build from our US wine and spirits distributor consolidation initiative theoverlap of the Q3 fiscal 2011 distributor inventory replenishment, combined with incremental marketing funding at Crown and the divestiture ofthe Australia and UK wine business. We've generated $587 million of free cash flow for the first nine months of the year, $287 million more than the same period last year. Due to thisexcellent performance, we've increased our fiscal 2012 free cash flow target by $100 million to a range of $700 million to $750 million, an all-timehigh at Constellation.     Now, let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities, less CapEx. For the first nine months of fiscal 2012,we generated free cash flow of $587 million, versus $299 million for the same period last year. This improvement primarily reflects a reduced useof cash to fund receivables and a cash benefit for taxes. Our receivable balance increased less than the previous year due to timing of sales, and the sale of our Australia and UK business. As a reminder, in Q1 we received a net refund of taxes, primarily related to the Q4 fiscal 2011 sale of our UK business. As mentioned earlier, we're increasing our fiscal 2012 free cash flow target by $100 million, to a range of $700 million to $750 million. The increaseis primarily due to the expected realization of additional cash tax benefits from the sale of our UK business that were previously targeted for fiscal2013. We're also reducing our CapEx estimate by $15 million to a range of $70 million to $80 million. As previously discussed, we believe our sustainablefree cash flow is in the $500 million-plus range. Now, let's move to our full-year fiscal 2012 P&L outlook. As noted earlier, we continue to expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the rangeof $2 to $2.10, versus our $1.91 result in fiscal 2011. This includes the estimated $0.06 benefit for share re-purchases, which is consistent with ourprevious guidance. As outlined by Rob, we now expect depletions for our US wine and spirits business to come in a bit below the market trend, and our planned targetfor the full year. We expect the corresponding shortfall in sales volume to be somewhat offset by some mix benefits and cost reductions. We'vealso reduced our interest expense guidance. For Crown, we continue to target low- to mid-single-digit depletion growth for the year, and flat to slightly down operating earnings due to theincremental marketing funding. I would also like to highlight a few Q4 fiscal 2012 comparison items for you. For our North American business, we're facing an easier shipmentcomparison for Q4, as the inventory build during fiscal 2011 was effectively completed by the end of Q3. We are also expecting lower promotionalexpense, and some additional mix benefit in Q4 versus Q4 last year. For Crown, in Q4 we expect an improvement in sales growth, and marketing spend to moderate, versus the higher levels experienced in Q2 andQ3 of this fiscal year. Overall, the good news is that the beer business continues to drive growth in a difficult category, and we're seeing improving depletions andmarketplace trends for our wine and spirit business, as our focus brands are performing better, and our new product development initiatives aregaining traction. Our strong free cash flow generation and deleveraging efforts have created flexibility in our capital structure management. This flexibility has enabled us to buy back a significant number of shares, as we have repurchased $281 million of stock through Q3, which is ontop of the $300 million we re-purchased in the last fiscal year. We expect to continue to evaluate share re-purchases as an opportunistic basis, aspart of our ongoing efforts to optimize the capital structure of the business. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

If I could start maybe and see if you can quantify for us the impact that Arbor Mist and Vendage had on your overallfocus brand depletions."
6,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,True,False,False,"Yes. It actually had quite a significant impact and if we stripped out just those two brands, we would have gained share in the overall category,wine category, for the quarter. That really has been a big driver of our overall market share loss in total wine. Now if you look at just table wine, we did gain share in the quarter, and if you look at premium plus, we gained share in the quarter, too. I mentionthat because clearly, the premium plus category above $5 is our primary focus."
7,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Kaumil Gajrawala,UBS,Analyst,True,False,False,"Got it. And then also just a follow-up on quantification. Is there any way for you to give us some context on what growth may have been onshipments, excluding the inventory build from -- at Crown last year?"
8,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,True,False,False,"Yes, this is Bob, Kaumil. I don't think we can get into that kind of detail."
9,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Kaumil Gajrawala,UBS,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay. No problem.Then just clarifying something on your guidance for Crown.You said improved sales growth and marketing spend to moderate.Just want to understand, because was that from a depletions perspective, or is that from a shipments perspective. Also, was the increased volumelast year in 4Q also the replenishment of the supply issues?"
10,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,True,False,False,"Yes. So, the replenishment of the supply chain issues in the beer business was done by the end of the fourth quarter -- I mean the third quarter.The fourth quarter, from a shipment-depletion perspective was pretty clean. Okay. So, we expect to -- for shipments in depletions, to continue tohave pretty good growth in the fourth quarter. Now this year, one of the reasons that the beer business's EBIT is down is incremental marketing spend. You'd think the majority of that is behindus, as this year they spent the wide majority of that incremental monies in the peak summer season so in Q2, Q3. That's why I said Q4, we expect continued or even slightly better sales growth, which would -- the same as depletion growth for the fourth quarter,and reduced marketing, as opposed to the previous year."
11,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Kaumil Gajrawala,UBS,Analyst,True,False,False,Got it. And final question on prioritization of the free cash flow. You now have $100 million more than planned. Should we -- given how often youtalked about the buy-back in your prepared remarks -- should we assume that much of that can go toward incremental buy-back?
12,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,True,False,False,"Yes. I mean our Board authorization is still at the $500 million level, and we have a little bit over $200 left on that. We don't have any additionalBoard authorization at this point. But as usual, we'll be looking at the market general trends to see whether we should be out there buying backmore of our shares."

Rob, just on the wine business, just as you think about the payback that you've gotten in the current quarter from higher promotions.Obviously depletions improved sequentially, but it seems like it sort of came at the expense of higher promos. Can you maybe help us understand,do you think you've got enough payback on those spendings? What will the competitive environment look like? Then as you look out in fiscal 2013 with a lot of these new products coming in line, how should we think about the promotional spending? Thenis 2013 finally the year where you think you can get the wine business to grow in category growth?"
16,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,True,False,False,"Yes, so I think in terms of payback on promotional spending, we certainly feel that we are getting a payback, and you can sort of see it as a resultof the sequential improvement in growth when we increase promotional spending. Now, we do also mitigate that to a degree and fund it by taking some of the actions which we've taken, such as increasing net price on our valuebrands, where we frankly don't care that much about share, to help fund and offset some of the costs of promoting our premium plus portfolio.But in general, yes, promotional expense is up net, net, net, and yes, we think that it is paying back, given where we would otherwise be if we didn'tdo so. What was your second question, Judy?"
17,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Judy Hong,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,True,False,False,"So, if that's the case--"
18,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,True,False,False,"As far as growing with the category next year, our plan is certainly to grow in line with the category next year, and as we build momentum thisyear and are either -- depending on the category -- exceeding category growth rates or nearing total category growth rates, we should go intonext year with good momentum to achieve that."
19,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Judy Hong,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay. And then Bob, just in terms of the whole shipment versus depletion delta on the wine business, are we completely now done just in termsof the distortions in the fourth quarter? Are we still to start off cleanly as depletions matches shipments at your wholesaler level?"
20,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,True,False,False,"Yes, I'd say the wide majority of it is done. There could still be some adjustments for the fourth quarter, because what we've said is for the full year,shipments will equal depletions, right? So, you kind of adjust in the fourth quarter to get to the full-year balance."
21,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Judy Hong,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay. And then on the Crown side, just any updated thinking just in terms of how you're thinking about pricing? Clearly your depletion trendshave been pretty healthy, but the margins have not really followed through. Just how you're thinking about pricing at this point?"
22,18590543,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,True,False,False,"Yes, good question. So, as we know, the beer category has been experiencing negative volumes. The larger domestic players have been takingsome pricing.We actually at the Crown business took some front-line pricing in October. Not as much as the domestic players, and the pricing wasdifferent by brands and by geographies. But the other thing that the Crown business is doing is reducing its promotion spending, which is in essence, an increase in the net price to theconsumer. Now that reduced promotion spending is reinvested in marketing. So, that's why when you see the Crown income statement, you'll seea pretty big increase in marketing expense, because there's two things going on there. There's money coming from promotion down into marketing, and there's the incremental funding that's occurring on the Crown P&L versus theprior year. So it's a pretty big increase in the marketing spend. Looking at how volumes and how dollars sales growth has been doing versus the category, it seems to be being pretty successful. And the marketing'sbeen pretty well received, Rob gave some of those awards. I think those guys are doing a great job in feeling good about their top line. I think themarketing overlaps from prior year are kind of hurting the bottom line. But that should abate as we go into next year."

Earnings Conference Call",Judy Hong,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,True,False,False,"So, if you take the front-line pricing and the reduced promo spending on Crown, the net price per barrel would have been up sort of 1% to 2% kindof level?"

Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,True,False,False,"Judy, you can kind of look at IRI and look at the volume growth versus the net sales growth. You'll see that the net pricing to the consumer in IRIis up just north of 2%, which is less than the domestic guys, but still pretty healthy, especially when you compare that to how the volumes aredoing to prior year."

As I mentioned in my talk, we have very ramped up new product initiatives and expect to introduce almost 20 new products into the market place.This year, it contributed roughly 200 basis points or 2% to our overall growth, and next year it should -- as I said, contribute significantly more."

I would say starting with the promotional environment and the holiday season, it has been fairly consistent with how things have played outthrough the year, and basically with last year. Now, as you are aware from previous calls, this year's harvest in California was down, and in certain areas and in certain varietals, oversupply isturning into under-supply, especially in the north coast.     As a consequence of that, I would say that we probably think that you will see some pricing being taken on, especially higher-end products thatare suffering from some of the under-supply. Now, that said, are we seeing any widespread examples of that? No. I've put that just more in the category of what people think, as opposed towhat's really happening, so we're going to be watching it very carefully as we go into next year to see what's happening out there in the marketplace."

It cankind of go both ways, but in general, I would say that we're going to be more inclined to price value wines than the opposite, meaning take pricingdown or drive for volume or share."

Just Rob, wondering how you think about the dollar price point positioning of your portfolio now versus the wine category. Itseems to me that it skews more favorably up the price point than it did several years ago.That's been kind of where the growth is in the wine sector. Why shouldn't we think that you would out-perform the overall wine category in 2013, or fiscal 2013, I should say?"

Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,True,False,False,"Well, again, whether we gain share or lose share in the category, it will be very dependent on sort of the decisions we make as to how do we pricevarious elements of our portfolio. Our portfolio is large, we've got a lot of wines -- and I'll say outside of mainstream categories -- whether it is beverage, dessert wines, kosher wines,fruit-flavored varietal wines. We are very tactical in our decisions from a financial perspective as to whether to opt more for pricing or whether toopt more for value. I would say that sort of the best measure of how we're doing overall is how we're doing on our focus brands, which is a relatively small portfolioof 17 brands, and constitutes the vast majority of our profitability in the United States.There, we're particularly interested in whether we're gainingor losing share.     Now that said, one of the focus brands is the value brand. It is Arbor Mist. It's a big brand. As I have said, we have made the decision and we did solast year -- this year, in actuality of the current year -- to tactically raise prices on that particular brand, and to sacrifice the volume which did impactthe overall growth rate of the focus brand. So, it's sum and sum."

My question has to do with the focus brand strategy. Specifically, while I recognize that the wine category is highly fragmentedso you need a number of offerings to compete effectively. I do wonder a little bit whether 19 focus brands is maybe too many, and could youpossibly better leverage your investments if you narrowed your focus a little bit? Is that under consideration at all?"

Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,True,False,False,"I don't think that 19 is necessarily too many, but that said, we have had, I'll say, a strategy of narrowing our focus and investment against a smallernumber of brands, even within our focus brands. Fundamentally, the answer to your question is no, there are not too many, but yes, we agree that in terms of investment, that probably narrowingthe focus and making bigger bets against a smaller number of brands is probably strategically the way to go. On the other hand, a lot of the brands are very profitable and need to be looked after appropriately. Fundamentally, we agree strategically withwhat you just suggested."

But going along with thatconcept, okay, you kind of start with what is the biggest piece of the portfolio, and that's the Mondavi franchise. Robert Mondavi and Woodbridgeby Robert Mondavi. That, in and of itself, is a large part of -- or the most important part of the focus brand portfolio. Then you've got a few -- I'm not just talking wine here -- you've got a few other important brands, like SVEDKA vodka, like Kim Crawford. Thosewould be examples of brands that really rise to the top in terms of their level of importance -- Clos Du Bois -- In the overall focus brand portfolio."

There might still be some flux between promo spend and marketing, but theykind of zero off at times, gets to the bottom line. All you'll be left with is pretty much pricing -- normal stuff, pricing and mix. Now, we do have thecontractual cost of goods sold increase. Okay, so just normal stuff, but I think the increased marketing and promotion spending will be behind us, and it will be [an] apples-to-apples yearif you look at fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 from a marketing and spending perspective at Crown."

And if I could build a little on the earlier question about operating income and wine growing faster than revenue. From where I sit, it's hardto see why you have that view. Is that a function of your mix view? Is it simply leveraging of the fixed costs? Can you talk a little bit more aboutthat, Rob?"

I think, Mark, most of it will come from we have some pretty robust plans in place to reduce costs of goods sold, and we've talked about thesea number of times, around things like reduced number of bottling lines, a higher fixed-cost leverage, some blend changes, some better warehousemanagement, some better grape buying, things around that. I think that we will keep SG&A growing below net sales, okay? I think those two areas,and COGS is the big number, will be -- will help us leverage the P&L. The wild card, I think will be promotion spending. Okay, because as you know, it's a pretty fractious industry. We're not the only player. We kind ofcan't raise prices when nobody else is, which as you know, Rob mentioned some of that earlier. I think the things within our control we feel prettygood about. I think that things that are a little less within our control, like pricing and promotions, well they're not within our control. That being said, we'vehad two years in a row of short harvests, so you would hope that the industry would reduce promotion spend and maybe increase prices, but timewill tell."
