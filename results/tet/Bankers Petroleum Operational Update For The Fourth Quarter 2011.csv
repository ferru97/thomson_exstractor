1,18608874,BANKERS PETROLEUM LTD,01/09/2012,1:45PM,BNK.TO,Bankers Petroleum Operational Update For The Fourth Quarter 2011,Abby Badwi,Bankers Petroleum Ltd.,"President, CEO",False,True,False,"Thank you, Denise. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and happy new year. With me on this call this morning is all of Bankers' executive team,who will also be available to answer your questions. To start 2012 was a bit of a difficult year globally, but also for international E&P companies losing a significant percentage of our equity value.Bankers also had its issues in trying to meet its early projections for production targets due to lack of historical data from the new horizontal wells.I believe we now have a better handle on individual well performance and a good understanding of difficulties associated with the developmentof an old oilfield and also learned what we needed to do to overcome some of these issues. Despite these challenges, Bankers had a record year of operational and financial results. Production grew by more than 30% and we will probablymore than double last year's cash flow. Our 2011 reserves audit will be completed by mid-February, and after producing close to 5 million barrelsin 2011, I am confident that we will see another year of reserves growth. Suneel Gupta, our COO, will provide you with an update on our operation in Q4, and will be followed by Craig Nardone, our VP, Exploration andDevelopment. Suneel."

I'd like to start by wishing everybody a happy new year. The fourth quarter was a very productive quarter with several projectsunderway, including drilling, production optimization, infrastructure construction, commencement of the thermal pilot, expansion into the deeperBubullima formations in the north and further development planning. We achieved record production levels, approaching 16,000 barrels per day by the end of the year, and we are currently over 16,000 barrels of oilper day. The average production for the quarter was up 5% and 13,833 barrels of oil per day from the previous quarter with the continued growthquarter on quarter.     With the addition of the fifth drilling rig bringing the rig count up to five, three from the Croatian company, Crosco, and two from Canadian company,Simmons, we continued drilling in the fourth quarter at a high pace to drill 26 wells in the quarter. This is a record number in a single quarter forthe Company. The drilling targeted production growth as well as reserves growth, with the year-end reserves review approaching. Several of the drill locationswere focused on expanding into new areas of the field to establish production from horizontal completions and compiled development plans toaccess recoverable reserves in new areas. The production optimization efforts continued in the quarter, including well speedups, sand cleanoutsand well configuration reviews to improve the performance from the horizontal and vertical walls.The work has associated downtime to completethe well intervention work, but resulted in improved performance from several wells. The water handling capacity was also expanded in the quarter with the addition of a new drill disposal well. We are now able to dispose of over30,000 barrels of water per day from 12 disposal wells, which enabled further production optimization efforts and resumption of production fromhigher water-cut wells after offset water control work.The benefit of the water control [is to] restrict water cross-flow and influxes early, but definiteimprovement examples are present. We continued significant infrastructure expansion during the quarter with completion of the bridge over the Seman River and Phase 1 of the salespipeline and near completion of the Fier Hub and central treatment facility expansion.These key infrastructure projects will enable further productiongrowth, increasing our treating capacity to 25,000 barrels of oil per day. The thermal project reached a milestone in the fourth quarter with first steam injection in December. The generated calibration and operationworked well, with the good interactivity into the reservoir.We are planning to ramp up to full injection later in January, followed by first productioncycle with initial results projected for the second quarter. Reactivation expansion into the north area of the field in the deeper Bubullima sands was started in the quarter.The geologic mapping and presenceof undeveloped sandstone zones below the Marinza Sands is promising in this area. We have reactivated the first well, K-8, and we will follow upwith a second well this year, followed by new drilling to further define potential in this area. The Kucova water flood is also underway. We've activated two producers around the first injector and have seen some good fluid level responseon the wells. Initial flush production is at higher rates. At a higher water cut, the flood pattern balancing is underway to improve the oil sweep. With that, I will pass it on to Craig Nardone to give you some further details on the drilling in the fourth quarter."

In the fourth quarter, the drilling program continued onto land with four rigs drilling throughout the quarter, as Suneel said,with the addition of the fifth rig, which spudded its first well November 28. 25 horizontal oil wells and one horizontal water disposal well wererig-released during the quarter for the total of 26 wells. Of the 25 oil wells, five were drilled in Goran zones and 20 were drilled in Driza zones, withinitial production meeting forecast expectations. For the year, 76 horizontal oil wells and eight other wells were drilled for a total of 84 wells, which was on plan for the year. Drilling plans for Q1 2012 include 22 horizontal oil wells and three other wells for a total of 25 wells.The 22 horizontal wells are allocated approximately75% for production in Area 1 of the field, including the Driza 1 zone, and 25% for production and reserves growth in both the Driza and Goranreservoir zones in Areas 2 and 3. Highlights of drilling for the fourth quarter Goran development continued with the testing of the third Goran reservoir zone by drilling threehorizontal wells in the Goran 4. This is in addition to the Goran 5 and 6 tested earlier this year. Initial production from the G4 ranges from 100 to150 barrels of oil per day. These G4 zone horizontal wells were drilled in Area 2 and open up additional Goran development potential. Currently,there are eight Goran wells on production in Areas 1 and 2, with initial production ranging from 40 to 210 barrels of oil per day and averaging 105.     Following up on this success, Goran zone development will continue in Area 2 further south in the field.This new drilling could potentially expandthe Goran reserve base in Area 2, where there are currently limited reserve bookings. Driza stepout horizontal wells are the other highlight for the quarter. During the fourth quarter, six D1 zone horizontal wells were drilled from thewestern edge of the current field development into Area 3. These wells have initial production ranging from 70 to 270 barrels of oil per day andare currently averaging 190 barrels. Based on this success, additional horizontal wells are planned for 2012, with the potential to increase proven reserves and future developmentinto the undeveloped western side of the field in Area 3. And as Suneel mentioned, we also drilled one additional horizontal water disposal wellin Q4, with plans to continue water disposal expansion with two additional wells in Q1. Thank you."

6,18608874,BANKERS PETROLEUM LTD,01/09/2012,1:45PM,BNK.TO,Bankers Petroleum Operational Update For The Fourth Quarter 2011,George Toriola,UBS,Analyst,True,False,False,"Thanks and good morning, guys. Happy new year. I've got two questions. The first is on the production profile that you have on I think it is slide15 in your presentation. Just going through that phase, sort of three periods where the slope of that growth for horizontal production changesbetween the first 50 wells -- sorry, the first 30 wells, the next sort of 40 wells and then the last 30 wells or so. The question here is to Suneel. What do you think is the primary driver here? Is it a difference in the completion? Is it decline rates? What is theprimary driver of the change in slope of that curve here?"
7,18608874,BANKERS PETROLEUM LTD,01/09/2012,1:45PM,BNK.TO,Bankers Petroleum Operational Update For The Fourth Quarter 2011,Suneel Gupta,Bankers Petroleum Ltd.,"EVP, COO",True,False,False,"Hi, George. With regards to the change in the slope, there are several things happening. Obviously, the early wells that were brought on, as wetalked about about a year ago, we had some very good performance from the early wells where the rates were fairly high. As we get more wells into that mix, then the decline impact in the early decline period does get mixed in with some of the new production that iscoming on. So it is a combination. We also did go through a change in the operational practices, where we are not pulling as hard from the wellsand we are not going after the peak production rate from the wells. We are looking more for the stabilized production, which addresses some ofthe limitations in the well bore configuration, the artificial lip design at these depths, things like that. So the slope that we see more recently in the latest wells that have come on, that is more of a sustainable slope. But it does still average in all ofthe earlier wells as well as the new wells."

And the other question is just following on your -- this is a slide 17 in your presentation that talks about reserve growth potential.The most material one there is the Goran in Area 2, where you have the recovery factor going from 0.4% up to 10%. So it is a two-part question. First is over how over what period of time do you think you will be able to see that recovery factor expand? And secondly, what is behind theexpansion of that recovery factor? What are you doing or expecting that you would see that recovery factor expand?"
9,18608874,BANKERS PETROLEUM LTD,01/09/2012,1:45PM,BNK.TO,Bankers Petroleum Operational Update For The Fourth Quarter 2011,Suneel Gupta,Bankers Petroleum Ltd.,"EVP, COO",True,False,False,I think you are addressing Area 3 primarily. Area 3 represents an area that has very little additional -- or early well control. It is an area where westill have to do a lot of delineation in order to properly understand reservoir.
10,18608874,BANKERS PETROLEUM LTD,01/09/2012,1:45PM,BNK.TO,Bankers Petroleum Operational Update For The Fourth Quarter 2011,George Toriola,UBS,Analyst,True,False,False,It is area -- as you have it here on slide --

12,18608874,BANKERS PETROLEUM LTD,01/09/2012,1:45PM,BNK.TO,Bankers Petroleum Operational Update For The Fourth Quarter 2011,George Toriola,UBS,Analyst,True,False,False,That's right.
13,18608874,BANKERS PETROLEUM LTD,01/09/2012,1:45PM,BNK.TO,Bankers Petroleum Operational Update For The Fourth Quarter 2011,Suneel Gupta,Bankers Petroleum Ltd.,"EVP, COO",True,False,False,"Okay. The Gorani Area 2 is the southern area. This -- it will take a few years for us to really get recognition of that full recovery. We currently havedrilled a total of eight Gorani wells. Several of these are down in Area 2. So with these wells, it will give us a start to getting some recognition forthat reserves. But it will take additional wells and further development in Area 2 in order to realize the full 10%. And it can be quite a bit higher than the 10% it can also be approaching towards the 20%, as the Driza is, as we continue to develop and see thepositive performance from the Gorani in that area. So it will take some time as we continue to drill wells in that area."

Good morning, guys. Just a question on your thermal project. If I was reading the press release correctly, it said you were actually going toresume steam injection later in January. I didn't realize you actually stopped. I wonder if you could just clarify that. And I wonder if you could justrefresh our memories on the steam injection cycle and when you expect first production to occur."
17,18608874,BANKERS PETROLEUM LTD,01/09/2012,1:45PM,BNK.TO,Bankers Petroleum Operational Update For The Fourth Quarter 2011,Suneel Gupta,Bankers Petroleum Ltd.,"EVP, COO",True,False,False,"With regards to the thermal project, what we did in December was we wanted to -- we started the first steam, but it was primarily targeted atensuring the steam generator was working properly, that we were able to get the injection rates into the reservoir that we were hoping for. So wewere able to attach this. We did get the generator up to full capacity, and we injected about 4000 cubes of steam, the water-equivalent steam. So with that, though, we then started looking at the offset wells that may be affected as we get further into the full cycle of steam. Some of thesewell bores we didn't have access to initially. They were in Albpetrol's inventory still. So we recently took those over, and what we are doing now isjust isolating those wells, basically putting a new wellhead on there and putting some gauges so we can monitor the pressure and temperatureconditions. And then we will ramp to the full-steam cycle. With the full steam cycle, it will end up being roughly about two months, so 60 days. And then following that will be a soak period and then theproduction cycle. So we should see first-production results in second quarter."

Just to follow up on what Alex was asking there, if you are not currently injecting steam right now, it is going to be aroundthe end of January, then your 60-day injections actually are going to last essentially February, March, if I do the calendar math right."

What we did in the fourth quarter, we drilled 26 wells one was a disposal well, 25 were horizontal production wells. Of those 25 wells,there is roughly 9 to 10 of those were what we would call reserves-focused wells. So it means some of these wells, as Craig had mentioned, cameon at some decent rates. But they were the earlier wells that we drilled in the quarter. Later in the quarter, we started shifting towards productionfocus, so they came on later in the year. And you know, the exit production we achieved was 15,535, and yet we are over 16 now. So there is a few of those wells that just came on overthe last week here, and they've come on at very good rates. So it just is the timing of when the wells came on that impacted that average rate."

On the water flood at Kucova, you said you've started up the two offsets. Are you getting any kind of oil rates at all or is this just mostly waterbreaking through?"
