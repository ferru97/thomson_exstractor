1,18609051,ADA ES INC,01/05/2012,12:35AM,ADES,"ADA ES INC at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC ""Energize` Conference",Michael Durham,ADA,"ES, Inc.",False,True,False,"Thank you. Thanks. Well, those of you who aren't familiar with us, we're a clean coal technology company. We provide emission control equipmentfor the coal-fired power industry. As far as investment highlights, we've just completed a pretty remarkable year for us and are pretty excited about 2012 and what it's going to meanfor the company.We expect very rapid expansion of our refined coal business.This is a business in which we had two facilities, refined coal facilities,up and running for over 1.5 years now. And then in the first year of operation, it generated over $20 million of revenue for us and $7 million of EBITfor ADA. Last year, we placed in service 26 new refined coal facilities that will be coming up and operating in 2012. We expect these to generate pretaxincome of up to $50 million by the end of 2012 for the next 10 years. In December, EPA passed the Mercury Air Toxics Standard. This requires 1200 power plants to control mercury for the first time. The EPA predictsthat this will create a market of about $9 million per year for emission control technology. ADA is the market leader in mercury control technology, and we have three different technologies for controlling mercury. We provide activatedcarbon injection equipment. We provide refined coal. And we also -- we provide enhanced coal that we license to Arch Coal. Keep in mind as wetalk about the earnings potential of these we have 10 million shares. So the type of emission control equipment that we provide is low-cost CapEx relative to the large scrubber-type projects, which are very highCapEx. If you look at the fleet of coal-fired power plants, we have about 1200 of them across the country, and the average age is over 50 years old. So, as these old power plants have to address these new emission controls, something that has a very high capital cost may not be justified becausethey may not have a 20-year life on which to pay for that equipment. What ADA provides are lower capital costs in which we essentially -- most of the cost is in the cost of a chemical, so it provides an operating costinstead of a capital cost. For example, a scrubber might cost a plant $200 million to $300 million, whereas we provide for mercury control, activatedcarbon injection equipment, that's about $1 million. We provide dry sorbent injection equipment for acid gases.That's about $3 million and our refined coal, which actually gives them mercury controlfor free, and they actually profit somewhat from the tax credit. Enhanced coal requires no capital equipment for the plant, but they will be paying for it in a premium for the fuel costs.     Current consolidated cash of about $40 million. So we are very excited about what we're able to accomplish in 2011.That has put us in a very strongposition with these 26 new refined coal facilities that we hope to get up and running this year and a new mercury control regulation that we feelis going to be a significant revenue generator for us. So, with that, I thank you for your interest."

And what we have seen is, on this first line, it was builtin two years. So, you would want -- time it so that it's producing when the demand is there. So we will be looking at what kind of demand there is,generated by this new rule and based on the ability to sign take or pay contracts to sell off that system. That's when we would make a decision toparticipate in a future expansion."

One of our plans with the refined coal facilities is that we retain a few of those within the joint venture ourselves so that we're going to be generatingtax credits to offset taxable income that's generated there. So, for modeling purposes we have used a 35% rate kind of looking out, but as we lookforward past 2012 and we've got some NOLs in our balance sheet too of about $20 million after this extraordinary transaction in the fourth quarterof 2011, we are expecting that we'll be able to offset the majority of the taxes generated from the refined coal activities with those credits. And sofor modeling purposes, we are expecting the federal rates to be in that 15% to 20%, if not lower than that. So, depending on what facilities we retain for our own purposes and operate and retain those tax credits. So it will be considerably less than the35% kind of historical rate that we've looked at."

The enhanced coal was put on a back burner because it's the same groups of people that were putting in their refined coals andtesting it. So we have -- our plans -- multiple tests of the concept of the coal additive mercury control this year. The market for it will be, again, the states that are already regulating mercury. And that's going to be driven by, as those states started -- as theplants in those states were controlling mercury, they signed long-term activated carbon contracts. So, as these long-term contracts are starting to come to the end of theirs, we will try to push into those as an alternative to additional contractsthere. Until -- other than that, the next market -- the biggest market is going to be -- wants compliance for the federal by all 1200 plants in 2015. All right, thank you."
