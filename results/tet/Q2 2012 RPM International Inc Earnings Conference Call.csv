1,18590504,RPM INTERNATIONAL INC,01/05/2012,3:00PM,RPM,Q2 2012 RPM International Inc Earnings Conference Call,Frank Sullivan,RPM International Inc.,Chairman and CEO,False,True,False,"Thank you, Jennifer. Happy New Year, and welcome to the RPM International Inc. quarterly conference call for the second quarter ended November30, 2011. As you saw from the earnings release this morning and related to our comments about our second quarter during our October conferencecall, there are a lot of moving parts in relationship to one-time gains in last year's second quarter and a number of offsetting one-time gains andone-time expenses in this year's second quarter, principally related to investment in acquisition activity. When you strip away the non-operatingexpense from last year and the various non-operating gains and expenses in this year's second quarter, we believe the right way to look at ourresults from an ongoing operating basis is the second quarter, where sales grew 10% and net income and earnings per share grew about 9% yearover year. From a segment perspective, the non-operating income and expense items principally impacted our corporate expense categories andour industrial segment. If you strip these non-operating items out, our industrial segment generated a year-over-year second-quarter performance of 10% sales growthand 10% earnings growth, while our consumer segment generated a year-over-year performance of 12% sales growth and a decline in EBIT of 2%.Continuing raw material challenges and the balance of higher cost versus pricing actions resulted in less than desired leverage to the bottom linein our industrial businesses and a decline in profit margins in our consumer businesses.     Our goal in coming out of the recession was a focus on growth in global expansion and we have been aggressively and successfully executing onthis strategy. We are picking up market share in the vast majority of both our consumer and industrial businesses, in excess of underlying marketgrowth. In recent months, we are also seeing the first signs of some lessening in significant raw material categories with the sole exception of TiO2,which only really impacts our consumer segment and more specifically, Rust-Oleum. It is important to note that the combination of the non-operatingincome and non-operating expense items in this year's second quarter almost all relate to our ongoing acquisition activity. We've increased our investment in Kemrock in India to a level of 23%, allowing us to account for this investment for the first time on an equitybasis. With the closing of the FEMA EIFS and coatings business in Germany on January 3, 2012, we have completed more than $160 million ofannualized sales from acquisitions during this fiscal year. While these acquisitions have resulted in the expense of significant deal transactions,including on a number of the smaller transaction's broker fees, as well as one-time hits to the cost of goods sold and the relationship to inventorywrite-ups, all of which are in our industrial segment results, all of these acquisitions will be nicely additive to sales and earnings towards the endof our 2012 fiscal year and for our full 2013 fiscal year. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob Matejka, RPM's senior vice president and chief financial officer to provide you details on the quarter,after which we'll answer your questions. Bob?"
2,18590504,RPM INTERNATIONAL INC,01/05/2012,3:00PM,RPM,Q2 2012 RPM International Inc Earnings Conference Call,Bob Matejka,RPM International Inc.,"SVP, CFO",False,True,False,"Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We thank you for joining us today. First, I'll review the results of operations and cash flow activitiesfor our fiscal 2012 second quarter, comment briefly on some year-to-date results of operations items, I'll touch upon a few November 30, 2011balance sheet measures and then I'll turn it back to Frank for closing comments before we take your questions. Our fiscal 2012 second-quarterresults resulted in a consolidated net sales increase of 10.9% over the prior year to $916.1 million, principally due to volume improvement of 5.1%,price increases of 2.9%, and acquisition growth of 3%.These all were partially offset by unfavorable forex of about 0.1%, almost nonexistent on theforex side.The industrial segment net sales of $641.5 million, which accounted for 70% of net sales, increased 10.1% over last year with acquisitiongrowth of 4.2%, volume increases of 3.2%, price increases of 2.9% all which were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of about 0.2%. At the consumer segment, net sales of $274.6 million increased by 12.6% over the same quarter last year, with 9.5% attributable to unit volumegrowth, 3.0% from positive price, and 0.1% attributable to acquisitions. Forex had no impact on the consumer segment during this quarter. Our consolidated gross profit increased to $369 million from $339 million last year, principally due to the higher sales volume, price increases, andsome favorable mix. As a percent of net sales, gross profit declined by 80 basis points to 40.3%, due to the persistently high cost of raw materials. Consolidated SG&A increased roughly 12.5% to $281.9 million from $250.6 million last year, due to the increase in the variable costs that areassociated with higher sales volumes, such as compensation and benefits, distribution costs, advertising and promotional issues, as well as acquisitioncosts associated with our increased M&A activity. As a percent of net sales, SG&A increased to 30.8% of sales from 30.3% a year ago. Earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, increased to $93 million this year from $89.4 million last year, due principally to the higher sales volumes.Realized price increases were not able to offset the higher raw material costs, resulting in an EBIT margin percent that declined from 10.8% to10.2%. At the industrial segment, EBIT increased 14% to $78.3 million from $68.7 million a year ago, driven by overall 10.1% increases in sales, includingprice increase, and a favorable sales mix. These improvements were more than offset by higher raw material, resulting in an EBIT margin increaseto 12.2% of net sales this year compared to 11.8% last year. Our consumer segment EBIT declined 2.0% to $26.7 million from $27.3 million a year ago. The sales increase to 12.6%, including price increases of3%, were not able to offset higher raw material costs and an increase in variable selling expenses that are associated with higher sales volumes. Corporate and other expenses increased by $5.4 million, primarily due to the higher acquisition costs of $3 million and insurance reimbursementsin last year's second quarter of approximately $2.9 million that did not repeat this year.     Interest expense increased from $16.4 million a year ago to $17.9 million and this is primarily due to the issuance of an additional $150 million indebt in May of 2011, a higher average interest rate year over year and increased borrowings associated with this year's increased acquisition activity. Investment income decreased $3.3 million year over year, primarily as a result of gains on sales of marketable securities last year of approximately$3.2 million that did not recur this year. The income tax rate of 29.2% for the quarter compared to last year's rate of 30.8%, principally due to the change in the jurisdictional mix of actualand forecasted earnings, the impact of certain foreign operations on our U.S. taxes, and adjustments to certain tax valuation allowances. The bottom line net income attributable to RPM shareholders increased 2.3% to $49.9 million compared to last year's $48.8 million and EPS wasflat to last year at $0.38 per share. As you've seen in our earnings release and Frank's comments at the beginning of this discussion, we previously reported that last year's secondquarter included roughly $7.5 million of nonrecurring items representing an after-tax benefit of approximately $0.04 per diluted share. This year'ssecond-quarter result of $0.38 per share include the benefit of the company's equity ownership in Kemrock Industries and Exports Ltd., totalingabout $0.04 a share, which was offset by $0.03 per share of costs related to higher acquisition-related expenses. Excluding one-time items in bothyears, EPS for the second quarter of this fiscal year of $0.37 per share exceeded EPS for the same quarter last year of $0.34 a share, or an increaseof 8.8%. Now, a few comments on our year-to-date results -- consolidated net sales increased 10.5% to $1.9 billion from $1.72 billion last year, principallydue to a volume improvement of 3.6%, price increases of 2.9%, acquisition growth of 1.9%, and favorable forex, or foreign exchange, of 2.1%. EBITincreased 8.6% to $229.5 million this year from $211.4 million last year, due principally to higher sales volumes. Realized price increases were notable to offset higher raw material costs, resulting in an EBIT margin that declined from 12.3% to 12.1% of sales.The net income attributable to RPMshareholders on a year-to-date basis increased 7.6% to $126.7 million compared to last year's $117.8 million. EPS increased 6.6% to $0.97 per sharethis year compared to $0.91 a share last year. Looking at the balance sheet and cash flows, we find our six-month capex of [$18.4 million] (corrected by company after the call) compares to$15.3 million for fiscal 2011. The depreciation and amortization expense increased slightly to $36.9 million from last year's $36.7 million. Cash from operating activities for the year to date of $110 million compares with $183 million a year ago. Increases in inventory of $24.7 millionattributable to higher material costs, and a reduction of $46.3 million in accounts payable due to timing differences of payments, and a negativeswing in other accrued liabilities were the main factors that contributed to the decrease. Our receivable days sales outstanding was 61.6 dayscompared to 58.7 a year ago and days of inventory of 84 this year compared to 80.2 days last year. Finally, a few comments on our capital structure and overall liquidity -- as of November 30, 2011, total debt was $1.1 billion compared to $925.1million last November. On May 24, 2011, we sold $150 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% notes, which were a follow-on issuance ofour $300 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2019, which we initially issued on October 9, 2009. The follow-on offering was pricedat a premium with an effective yield to maturity of 4.934%.The proceeds will continue to be used for general corporate purposes. Our net-debt-to-capratio of 38.7 at November 30, 2011 compared to 34.5 a year ago. The increase is primarily attributable to the additional $150 million of new debtissued in May of 2011.The total long-term liquidity at November 30, 2011 was $803.9 million, with $301 million in cash and $502.9 million availablethrough our bank revolver in accounts receivable securitization facilities. With that, I'll turn the call back to Frank."

For the second half of our fiscal year, we expect continued high single-digit growth in our consumer businesses and continuing lowdouble-digit growth in our industrial businesses, as a result of underlying unit volume growth, continuing price increases, market share gains, andthe impact of completed acquisitions. As mentioned earlier, we are seeing relief in most of our major raw materials, with the exception of TiO2. We     are counting on this as an important aspect of our ability to continue to deliver the full-year result targeted at $1.60 to $1.65 per share, which wediscussed at the beginning of this fiscal year. I'd like to remind you that RPM's third quarter, covering the months of December, January and February, are historically a seasonal low. This yearis obviously no exception and we will be somewhat negatively impacted by the acquisition costs and inventory write-up of the FEMA transactionin our third quarter. In providing the details on that quarter, we'll call out the one-time impact of this acquisition to provide you a better understandingof the expected growth in sales and earnings of the core RPM businesses in our third quarter. With hints of improving economic conditions in North America, both as it relates to consumer takeaway and in some of the construction marketswe serve, expectations of some raw material relief in relationship to the huge challenges we have faced over the last couple of years, and the fulland positive impact of the acquisitions we have completed this year, we expect a strong finish to our 2012 fiscal year and a good start to our 2013fiscal year. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now be pleased to answer your questions."

Was there any benefit from weather, or was there pre-buying activity ahead of announced priceincreases by your customers, or could you give a little detail? How much of that percentage increase was due to new products? What new productsare you seeing a lot of momentum in?"
6,18590504,RPM INTERNATIONAL INC,01/05/2012,3:00PM,RPM,Q2 2012 RPM International Inc Earnings Conference Call,Frank Sullivan,RPM International Inc.,Chairman and CEO,True,False,False,"The unit volume growth there has been very good, about 9% in the quarter, and we're continuing to get raw material price increases or productprice increases. I'm not aware of any pre-buying, but I do know we have some additional price increases going into effect at the beginning of thiscalendar year. A lot of it is market share gains, both at our core retail customers, as well as pickups in some new accounts and also some newchannels. We're continuing to gain share, for instance, in the automotive sector. Some of the gross margin issues are a mix issue, as we're pickingup share in lower margin categories relative to, for instance, Rust-Oleum's historic margins. Some of it relates, in particular, to TiO2 -- just significantongoing raw material cost increases that are impacting the whole industry. But the strategy that we had coming out of the recession, we're executing.And it was really to focus on aggressive growth in all of our businesses, and we are executing on that. One other comment I would make in relationship to some of the new product introductions at our Rust-Oleum businesses and our DAP businesses,a good example would be DAP. We just announced a whole new window, door, and sealant line into the construction markets, particularly inrelationship to seeing those markets bottom out. And in the process, we have incurred a significant amount of SG&A expense in terms of packaging,product introductions, and the expense associated with a new product line whose potential over time is tens of millions of dollars of new sales,but whose P&L today looks a lot like expense and not a lot of sales because it was just introduced. We are focused on growth. We are focused on market share gains. And we believe, over time, that a combination of price increases and relief inraw materials will get our margins back in line."

Looking into the third quarter, are the acquisitions that you've made in the first half of the year -- I know historically the quarters werebreakeven, plus or minus $0.05 here or there.Would you expect, due to the acquisitions contribution, to be in the black for the quarter? Or is it still,think about it breakeven, plus or minus a couple of cents?"
8,18590504,RPM INTERNATIONAL INC,01/05/2012,3:00PM,RPM,Q2 2012 RPM International Inc Earnings Conference Call,Frank Sullivan,RPM International Inc.,Chairman and CEO,True,False,False,"No, we still have a little bit of inventory write-off relative to the Legend Brands, or write-up relative to Legend Brands business that we closed inSeptember, and the FEMA transaction which we closed just this month, January 3. We'll also have some negative impact on our third quarter as itrelates to inventory write-up. It'll be a hit to cost of goods sold, and also the acquisition-related costs in that transaction. But we will call out thoseseparate results."

Is that a change going forward that you're going to start calling that out? Or was thisquarter just particularly high due to all the activity that you've had in the first half, and you just want to make people aware of that?"
10,18590504,RPM INTERNATIONAL INC,01/05/2012,3:00PM,RPM,Q2 2012 RPM International Inc Earnings Conference Call,Frank Sullivan,RPM International Inc.,Chairman and CEO,True,False,False,"I think the answer is yes to both. For a number of reasons, our acquisition activity kind of in the mid to late 2000s had slowed down, and we weredoing mostly relatively small product lines. I think the last sizable acquisition we did was illbruck in 2005, and that was in relationship to privateequity valuation expectations, which are down dramatically, which is a good thing. We are buying businesses at our historic valuations, not theinflated valuations of 2006 to 2008. And in relation to that, changes in accounting, where five to seven years ago, all of your acquisition costs, bethey legal costs, due diligence costs, or on some privately negotiated deals, broker fees, were all capitalized. In today's world, all those costs areperiod expenses."

In the consumer segment going forward, even with the market share gains and the mix issues, you'd still expect to benefit from an improvingprice/cost spread. I know there's a volume issue in the third quarter, but going forward you'd expect the price/cost spread to sort of improve goingforward, even with the lower mix?"
12,18590504,RPM INTERNATIONAL INC,01/05/2012,3:00PM,RPM,Q2 2012 RPM International Inc Earnings Conference Call,Frank Sullivan,RPM International Inc.,Chairman and CEO,True,False,False,"That's correct.You will begin to see price/cost mix improvement really in the spring, as our third quarter is so seasonally low. It's hard to really guessat what that will be, but we have been experiencing some significant benefits in certain raw material categories with a FIFO accounting that willstart to show up here in the coming months."

Also, if they're some of the newer ones, is it an issue of you have to discount to get the initial shelf space, and then over time we cansee them go back, or is this something that could be a permanent drag on the margins going forward?"
16,18590504,RPM INTERNATIONAL INC,01/05/2012,3:00PM,RPM,Q2 2012 RPM International Inc Earnings Conference Call,Frank Sullivan,RPM International Inc.,Chairman and CEO,True,False,False,"In some cases, for instance, in automotive channels, a number of the product areas are lower margin, so that'll be permanently lower margin. Inother cases, it has been one-time lifts associated with getting into new accounts or getting new space, which won't be repeated. Then the otherissue is just a continuing game of catch-up on what has been an extraordinary increase in raw materials, particularly TiO2 that has hit our industrybroadly. The good news about TiO2 is it really does not impact RPM's industrial businesses. The only place that it really has an impact on us todayis in our Rust-Oleum Group, a little bit in small project paints, and principally in primers. Our primer business is a multi-$100 million business, andit is white. That white comes from TiO2, and that's been the raw material that has been most frustratingly high for our Rust-Oleum Group, as wellas for our industry."

One last question, you reiterated your full-year guidance that you gave back in July. And since then, you've made three acquisitionsthat you say are going to be at least modestly accretive. I'm wondering what incrementally is getting worse than maybe what you were expecting,if anything, or is it just you're taking maybe just a conservative approach?"
18,18590504,RPM INTERNATIONAL INC,01/05/2012,3:00PM,RPM,Q2 2012 RPM International Inc Earnings Conference Call,Frank Sullivan,RPM International Inc.,Chairman and CEO,True,False,False,"I don't think we're taking a conservative approach. I think what's happening is two things -- number one, our sales are better a little bit than weanticipated, particularly in consumer, but our raw material costs are worse, up until this point, than we anticipated. And then, the acquisitions willmost definitely help us in the fourth quarter. But on the full year, they're kind of a wash because, as you look at $1.60 to $1.65 target in EPS, it seemslike we're behind the curve. Part of that is the expensing of acquisition expenses, $3 million, $3.5 million of which hit this quarter, as well as theone-time negative hit to cost of goods sold from inventory write-ups. Those acquisitions have actually hurt us now. You will see a nice benefit inthe fourth quarter, which will make the fourth quarter look good. But relative to our full-year targets, we'll essentially offset the negative impactsof the transaction costs in the period in which the deals were done."

We are advocates of providing segment gross profit information, andwe would encourage you and all the investors here to encourage our peer companies and all companies you can even write a letter to the SECand suggest that companies provide gross margin information by segment. We think it would provide better information to investors. We mayget back to that unilaterally on our own accord, but you can only get hit over the head by so many places as to why we're the only one providingit relative to our industrial peers, and so that's what's behind that. We are advocates of it. As you point out, we've done it in the past, but it has, incertain instances, competitively served to hurt us in our businesses, because our peer companies do not provide it, nor does the SEC require it tobe provided."

The investment in Kemrock's currently about $36 million. We would hope that that would go up over time. It's an extraordinary company thatwe have partnered with in India. Seven years ago, it was a $14 million business. This year, it will do about $250 million in sales. Our ownershipinterest over that period has gone from 5% to what is now 23%.

We're in generally good shapeon cash from operations in our industrial business. The shortfall is a combination of higher inventory and lower margin delivery in the consumersegment, and that's being addressed. A lot of that is at our Rust-Oleum Group, that's, over time, one of our better businesses. I would expect us tocatch that up by the end of the fiscal year. We've targeted about $100 million of free cash flow for the year, and I think we'll get there."

Weare benefiting from that there in our Building Solutions Group in particular, and in particular, our sealant product lines. The other area that we would expect to benefit from that in the future is this new WDS category that we have been investing forward in, in ourDAP business.

Interestingly enough, our European sales and earnings are relatively flat to last year, and we haven't lost any margin. It's a combination of thefact that our exposure in Europe is principally industrial. Our Performance Coatings Group, which is our most global group and also has a bigpresence in Europe, is serving what is an expanding industrial capital spending and industrial maintenance spending market pretty much acrossall of our product categories and channels, whether it's in energy, oil and gas, infrastructure, a lot of areas like aerospace or food service. We havea very broad presence in multiple channels, and that is the area both in North America and globally where we're seeing continued strength.     When you look at that industrial segment growth of about 10%, and you realize that half of that is in building materials, mostly North America thatare growing 3% or 4%, it gives you a sense of the strong growth in the high performance coatings that serve the industrial capital spending andmaintenance markets in what they're doing. Secondly, our largest concentration of business in Europe is in Germany, and that's just been in partstrategic, but also lucky, because that's the largest market in Europe and the one that continues to show some positive momentum."

Having been through what we'vebeen through the last two years, it does not anticipate another significant rise in major raw materials this spring. That's one factor.     The other factor is, we have done a pretty good chunk of nice, strategic acquisitions, and year to date they have hurt our gross margin in industrialbecause of inventory step-ups, and they have hurt our corporate/other expense to the tune of $3.5 million or $4 million.

We are generally, in sales, earnings, and margins, flat to last year. We have some areas of strength, butwe're not experiencing the significant deterioration that the daily headlines would suggest. Given the nature of the products that we are manufacturingand selling in Europe, we don't anticipate any big deterioration there.The biggest challenge at this stage from Europe is what happens to the euroversus the dollar, and the impact on revenues and through our P&L of changes in relative foreign currencies, basically the dollar to the euro."

Unfortunately, they add to the seasonality of RPM, and sotheir winter months are also seasonally low. We're not getting the big boom from them relative to the seasonality of their business, but they areon target in the early months of their ownership by RPM, and we're real excited about that business and its growth prospects long term."

I think last year'sfourth quarter is essentially between the goods and the bads where it is. The Lancaster was the bankruptcy, and we highlighted that as it relatedto the results of our consumer segment, because it hit in the last month of our fourth quarter. But on a consolidated basis, that was essentiallyoffset by marketable securities gains from our captive insurance companies and other insurance items. I don't recall what those were, but on aconsolidated basis, the fourth quarter is what it was."

One final thing, your corporate expense last year, third quarter, fourth quarter was $16 million and then $4 million $16 million expense inthe third quarter, and only $4 million expense in the fourth quarter. Why such a divergence in numbers, and how should we think about corporateexpense in the back end of the year?"

But, again, without looking at the numbers, Saul, just to the comment you and I made, myguess is that the one-time gains in relationship to marketable securities or a pickup in insurance recovery that I mentioned in relationship to theLancaster write-off, would have occurred in the corporate/other category as the offsets. Because, again, on a year-over-year basis, our fourth quarteressentially was what it was, with the hit on Lancaster being offset by corporate non-Other in the quarter. Now, as it relates to how to think about corporate expense in the third or fourth quarter, the balance of the year, maybe Bob can add to that."

You should probably look ateach quarter at somewhere between $11 million to $12 million. It would be a normal run rate on the corporate and other side of our P&L structure."
