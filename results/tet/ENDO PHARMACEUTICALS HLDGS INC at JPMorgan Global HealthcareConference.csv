Quite a (inaudible) before getting up here, so. Let me go back here, if I can. Okay. Before I begin, I'll remind you of our forward-lookingstatements and that during the course of today's presentation, I may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You can read more about these itemsin the 8-K that we will file in conjunction with today's presentation. Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to be here and I thank you for the opportunity to speak with you at this conference. I'm very pleased, and I believethat Endo is not only achieving its corporate goals and objectives, but also redefining healthcare through a very successful diversification program.I'll put that into context for you by providing you an update on our recent financial performance, our strategy for growth and value creation, ourcommitments to R&D, innovation and some keys as to why we believe 2012 will be another exciting year for Endo. Now, for our strategy for growth is based on our belief that the healthcare system is changing and that the healthcare value will exist at theintersection of the [axis] of economics and outcomes, a system where all parties are working towards three common objectives maximum accessof care providers and patients alike prices that enable suppliers, payers, and providers to thrive and lastly, success measured by patients recoveryrates and quality of life. At Endo, we believe we can achieve this by creating more comprehensive offerings focused in pain and urology. And in 2012, we will focus onunlocking some of the value creation that a larger diversified Endo now has the opportunity to build on. We see notable opportunities in theQualitest, HealthTronics and AMS businesses. At the same time, we'll continue to evaluate the licensing and acquisitions of assets aligned with ourcurrent commercial businesses. We will focus on executing in our established businesses and with the acceleration launch of our new formulation of Opana ER. Strong commercialexecution in our base business enhances cash flow, pays down our debt and makes strategic investments that we believe will grow. We've madecommitments to reduce our leverage and we will pay down our debt in a timely fashion. Now, these slides I am really getting confused with, but I think we got them right here now. This is a very exciting time for Endo, not just in termsof our recent financial performance, but also because of the significant transformation of our business over the past three years. What was once aCompany focused solely on a single product in pain, we have diversified the Company into a diversified healthcare Company. Endo was focusedon multiple therapeutic products and platforms with the ability to sell both branded and generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices and healthcareservices to a wide array of medical specialties with particular focus in pain management and urology.     launching a number of new branded and generic products, implementing new programs across urology franchise and continuing the integrationof our expanded and diversified business. We are committed to the success of these initiatives and believe that we are important in creating valueand delivering better care to all of our customers. We will continue to invest in our business as appropriate and leverage our strong cash flow toreduce our debt. Truly excited about the year ahead, and thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. Thank you."
