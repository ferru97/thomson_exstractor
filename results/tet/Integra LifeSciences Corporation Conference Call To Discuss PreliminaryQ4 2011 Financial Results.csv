And then on the margin side, you were really looking for kind of the mix toExtremity's and Orthopedics broadly kind of driving the margin expansion. And yet, in the third quarter and then here now in thefourth quarter, both of those things seem to have yet to really materialize. International, as you mentioned, still weak. Extremity'sweak for a number of reasons. But I'm curious whether what's going on here has really caused you to kind of go back and reassesswhether that strategy laid out is really the best one for growing the Company going forward?"

I think overall our strategy has not changed. I think when we take a look at our broader outlook,the points that you made about our international opportunity -- as you know, it's over 77%, 75% of our overall growth is still domestic.We have a large opportunity, and we're making good progress on registrations, infrastructure, our new office capabilities. So, whenI take a look at, over our next three- to five-year horizon, very, very solid from an international standpoint. Extremities, as you spokeof and as we mentioned at the investor conference, relative to accretion really in Orthopedics bringing higher gross margin rates tothe overall business, we still believe is there. The reality of it is though our expectations for the growth that we thought we wouldhave in Q4 didn't meet our expectations, and with that we've tempered our 2012 expectations because of that. Then Jack, if you'd like to add any comments?"
3,18595943,INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,IART,Integra LifeSciences Corporation Conference Call To Discuss PreliminaryQ4 2011 Financial Results,Jack Henneman,Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp,CFO,False,True,False,"Yes. I mean, I think that the main point around Extremities, just to pound the point home because we just said it in the script, is thatwe think we've got specific rifle shot issues that are transitory. And we are, I think, doing everything we need to do on the Ascensionintegration, but moving sales from a distributed sales force to a direct sales force requires a lot of training, a lot of attention, theabsorption of a lot of knowledge. Similarly, we've been managing our supply issues out of the Plainsboro plant well, I think. The backorder came in well below thenumber we had sort of put out there back in November. But I think the thing we didn't quite appreciate was how much time it wouldtake the sales force to respond to the needs of the customer by moving product around.We're trying to be realistic, and say we thinkthat will continue into the first quarter. So, that has also tempered our view of things. But overall, we think the business is healthy,the sales force is very excited by the Ascension opportunity. We have unique material in the Pyrocarbon that is opening all kinds ofnew doors and exciting the existing doctors. So again, we believe this to be temporary, not longer term, and hope that by theSummer, we are rocking."

I guess post the analyst day and heading into 2012, SeaSpine for example, we thought the cross-selling associatedwith that transaction was going to be very, very important to Spine growth throughout 2012. I just wonder as we think about someof these integration-related disruptions in the fourth quarter, how confident are you in sort of SeaSpine integration and no disruptionto the Spine business broadly defined heading into 2012?"
7,18595943,INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,IART,Integra LifeSciences Corporation Conference Call To Discuss PreliminaryQ4 2011 Financial Results,Peter Arduini,Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp,CEO,False,True,False,"David, it's Peter, I'll comment and then Jack, you can add some thoughts to that. I think where we are with the SeaSpine integration,we feel very good that we've integrated the distributor structure. We're cross-pollinating our products we've got a lot of systems inplace and marketing structure in place that took a good chunk in 2011. And so we had stable results really in Q4, and we see thatcontinuing really into 2012. On the Extremity aside, remind you that we were actually integrating a distributor structure into a direct sales force as to combiningtwo distributor structures as we did in Spine. And some of that activity obviously now in retrospect is taking a little bit more time toget that integrated into our direct team. That being said, our teams are well trained, as I mentioned, now, up to speed on thoseproduct lines, feeling good about the new surgeon relationships that they have. And we believe obviously starting into the newyear we'll be able to get some of that disruption behind us. Jack, you may want to --?"

I mean, when we look back over these two integrations, I'd say we think we're doing the right things inboth cases. That doesn't mean that we have perfectly anticipated what would happen to revenues in every circumstance, which isa question about anticipating forecasting rather than actually executing. But the thing to bear in mind is that they are different in --the integration of these distribution systems, as Pete said, are different. One was SeaSpine, distributor to distributor where therewas very little overlap, and indeed, most distributors in both organizations were retained. In the Ascension side, we were terminatingmost, not all, but most of the distribution network, and moving those sales to a direct sales force that obviously causes more conflict.Overall, it held up pretty well. I'd say we should have anticipated more disruption than we did."

And it soundedlike there were some issues in the third quarter that weren't necessarily the same issues in the fourth quarter, specifically thinkingof the training. And again going back to the meeting coming off of the third quarter call and your analyst meeting, it sounded likesome of the third quarter issues were transitory. Can you give us some color in terms of the end market and maybe the availabilityof some of your Biologics, your Collagen products, were those things that, all other things being equal, ex the distraction of yoursales force, do you believe that the end market, the demand, the volume was there and this was more of a sales distraction? And then second, if you could give some sense as to when -- you mentioned middle of the year or the Summer, is it going to be acouple of quarters? Can we see an improvement in Q1? Any color on sort of timing would be helpful. Thanks."
12,18595943,INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,IART,Integra LifeSciences Corporation Conference Call To Discuss PreliminaryQ4 2011 Financial Results,Peter Arduini,Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp,CEO,False,True,False,"Yes, Matt, it's Pete I'll make some comments on it. Relative to the market and our growth, I mean we still believe that the market, aswas mentioned in Q3, had softened from, say, previous points in the first half of 2011. But we don't believe there's been any substantialchanges in the market at this point. Now, the fact is, we don't have a lot of other information from other folks reporting in with ourreporting early, but we don't have any indications that procedures have substantially changed or anything of that nature. From a Biologics standpoint and our proliferation of our product, that's advancing well within our Extremity's business. It also hasdone well within our Spine business as well, just to mention. And so, the main focus is, as we mentioned, is the distraction relativeto the two areas. The integration components that we spoke to, and really, as we were actually tight on supply on a lot of theRegenerative products, in the fourth quarter matching up the right level of products to the right customers, while the combinationof training and while also doing the integration, we overestimated the amount of burden it would put on the sales team. To yourpoint about, into the new year, as Jack commented on, we believe that in Q2, we'll be able to get this resolved and get it behind us."

Are you saying to us that you expect that share to comeright back by the second quarter? I would imagine your competitors aren't just going to sit back and let you come right back intoaccounts and gain share back, so maybe talk to us a little about your expectations for share recapture. Because it sounds to me likeyou're expecting the run rates to return back to normal levels by 2Q? Thanks."

And if you highlight the discussion on Instruments, which Jackcommented on was our biggest component of the miss, that ties with reduced levels of inventory. We know that that share is beingconsistent, so that we haven't had share loss there. In Extremity's area, whether we have had loss from share in the mid foot, hindfoot area, we don't necessarily have all of that data yet. The key though is, is the integration of 20 new products, new coverage ofsurgeons and capability just of our new reach, we're going to be able to pull back share. The question of -- is it the exact surgeonsand things that we might have lost some cases to? Yet to be seen. But with the opportunities of growth with bringing Ascension into bring both of our products together, we feel confident that we'll be able to grow share."

And that's a very different market. And we think we'll get that back. We have unique products there. It's really a differentanimal than the Orthopedics hardware."

That's very good color. Can I just hit one more follow-up, just on the warning letter, it sounds like the warning letter is not going to cost the Company anymore from an expense point of view. Is that correct? And then second, usually when a company gets a warning letter, the FDA doesn'tapprove any more products that would be pending at the FDA that would be made at that facility. Is that the case, and do you haveany products pending approval that would have been made by the facility in Plainsboro? Thanks."
19,18595943,INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,IART,Integra LifeSciences Corporation Conference Call To Discuss PreliminaryQ4 2011 Financial Results,Peter Arduini,Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp,CEO,False,True,False,"Yes, Glenn, it's Pete. Let me just kind of remind you and remind everyone -- so, we received the 483 back in early Fall, late Summer.And on the call and also at the investor day, we went through the details, and specifically talked about that we were treating this assevere as if we were going to get a warning letter. And put a lot of the aggressive plans in place between facility updates, changeswithin structure, and such that we believe currently with the warning letter that there really isn't a scope in the change of what thecosts are to remediate. In fact, as I mentioned, we look at what the observations are in the warning letter, and they match up wellto the 483, which is aligned well with the plans that we already have in place. Relative to what a warning letter means versus, say, a 483 as many of you know, PMA approvals are not approved until the warningletter is lifted. We don't have any major products planned as far as for PMA launches right now within the 2012 window tied to thatfacility. And again, this is specifically tied to the 105 facility it doesn't affect other facilities. Secondly, and relative to that is certificatesto foreign governments, those that don't have their own equivalent of an FDA that rely on FDA. FDA won't certify that. We believethat that impact is minimal at this point. We're going through and assessing that to take a look at it. There is some details relative toif it's already approved or asking for a new CFG. But those are typically the two areas that would impact. 510k's are okay. And we will be able to continue shipping our existing products. Obviously, we're treating this very aggressively. Wewant to be able to get all of these items addressed, and have the FDA come back in and inspect us and give us a clean bill of health."

So, are the current remediation post that,so now you're feeling like what you're doing is going to satisfy FDA, particularly after they talked about some not being adequatein some of your responses?"
23,18595943,INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,IART,Integra LifeSciences Corporation Conference Call To Discuss PreliminaryQ4 2011 Financial Results,Peter Arduini,Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp,CEO,False,True,False,"Steven, it's Pete. Good question. I think, as all of you get a chance to look at the warning letter, comments on September responsesand things of that nature, and as we had told you actually in early November, we had done quite a bit of work month by month. Andso the Agency has had a chance to see some of that. The warning letter from our view potentially doesn't incorporate all of thatchange that we had put in place. So, simple example would be, at the time of that response, the new roof for the whole facility wasn'tcompleted that's completed now, as an example. So yes, we have advanced a lot of the different changes within the overall facility, and we believe that we've made substantial changessince the initial component of that. That being said, we have to prove to the FDA that all of those are adequate, that we're incompliance, but we've been aggressively working towards that plan. And again, one of the key points that we talked about, wetalked about structure changes and things of that nature, and we would have those completed by December, and have the cleanrooms throughout the facility all up and running. That was achieved on plan, and we are back up and running."

I mean we just -- we personally just received the letter not that long ago, even though the letterwas actually dated on the 21st.We really didn't receive it until multiple days later with the holidays.We've had correspondence withthe district office, but at this point, we really don't have a whole lot more to comment on relative to timing."

Well, not a couple we'll call it one. First, it's unclearto me if the ongoing expenses on the quality control initiatives resulting from the 483 and the warning letter are in your non-GAAPearnings, or if those are stripped out of the non-GAAP earnings? And then related to that, seems rational to me that you would needto front load a bit to capital expenditure spending into 2012 to address these issues, so it would seem like free cash flow per shareshould be well under earnings per share in 2012, but perhaps you could comment on that?"

One, we are excluding expenses for remediation and underabsorption in the 105 plan. So, in that sense, weare proposing to break those out, which puts the investor community in the position of analyzing our numbers how they see fit. Wedo believe that both the out-of-pocket expense component and the underabsorption component is a short-term item, and won'treflect the long-term performance of the Company. So, we break it out, and exclude it from the adjusted EPS. The second item is -- with regard to CapEx, there had been capital expenditure, mostly in Q4, for remediation of that plan. Theremay have been a little in Q3 already -- have to go back and look. We do not now anticipate substantial incremental CapEx for thispurpose in that plan in Q1.There's always ongoing, but the main [bolus], the new roof and the construction inside the plant happenedall within Q4 and no, we don't have a broken out, granular number on that yet. That's part of the results that we need to finalize,and we'll probably -- I'm sure we'll have that number if people want it on the February call."

I think we've mentioned in the past that both of those, because of the level of integration thatwe've done, we fundamentally don't have separate entities anymore. And so, we've actually cannibalized some product lines for thebenefit of others, and integrated those in, so the numbers separately really don't represent where the business is."

Right. Well, please don't blame me for trying. What I'm trying to figure out here is, as I look into 2012 and the revenue growthguidance that you've provided, by my estimate I'm thinking those acquisitions contribute somewhere on the order of incremental4% or so, give or take. And so, that would mean that organic growth would be somewhere in that 4% range for 2012. And based onmy math, I think revenues may have declined year over year on an organic basis as core. So, I just was hoping that you could takeus through the businesses again to help us understand the building blocks of how we get to positive organic revenue growth in2012. Thank you."

Well, as far as your 2012 breakdown goes, Charles, at least at the consolidated level, it sounds like you're right on target. Of thegrowth that we forecast for 2012, about 0.5 will come from the full-year effect of the SeaSpine and Ascension acquisitions. And about0.5 will come from, shall we say, growth in the legacy business and so forth. And then we expect to have a negative headwind ofabout 1% from currency effect. So, that's sort of the high level take on those numbers. Now, you might say, well, if you know how much is organic and how much is accretive -- or how much is incremental from theexisting business, why don't we give the break-out? The answer is, they are estimates for the reasons Pete described, where it's ajudgment call, the truth is -- they are integrated businesses, sales reps make choices about what products to sell and what not. So,when we talk about next year, what we say is -- look, those were existing businesses that had certain performance last year, and thisis how you can kind of think about it, about 4% from the full-year effect, about 4% from growth in legacy, and then take away aboutone all-in for currency effect, and that's about where we are."

40,18595943,INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,IART,Integra LifeSciences Corporation Conference Call To Discuss PreliminaryQ4 2011 Financial Results,Jack Henneman,Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp,CFO,False,True,False,"Okay, so I'm going to take those in reverse order. On the Instruments side, yes, we believe that the Alternate Site underperformancethis quarter will resolve itself in the first half. We've actually seen this phenomenon before. And we saw a significant destocking inAlternate Site in the first quarter of 2009. And it took about six months to sort of get fully back to normal. It seemed to be more rapidthis time, and it may mean that it will recover more quickly as a result. We do know from at-the-store sales data that our distributorscontinue to sell our products about as expected. So, we don't think we've lost any share. So, overall, we think that business isfundamentally sound.     Now, as far as the end market assumptions go, we've made no dramatic assumptions about any of our end markets changing in anyfundamental way. We've seen a fair amount of pressure in Europe, especially in the countries that have become famous for havingeconomic issues. But that's -- I'd say we made no heroic assumptions about market expansion changes, macro conditions or anythingelse. Just to remind the team, try to keep it to one question each."

And sowe know that that end-user data hasn't fundamentally changed, that's why we know we haven't lost share. And they made consciousdecisions not to carry as much inventory, but they will need X level of inventory to meet their needs in the go-forward basis that'swhy we believe that the recovery, as Jack stated, will happen the way he outlined."

Can you talk a little bit more about what exactly happened in Asia, and whether the US weakness was just because ofcapital equipment lumpiness or it was something more?"

And so, we didn't have the same level of surge in that area. Wehad some good Disposables response, so we don't see anything that says that there's any major changes there from that standpoint. As we look at Neuro in Asia, we commented that there was some certain areas with distributors based on timing and whatnot thatthey didn't take the same level of product that they had normally taken from a standpoint of some of our capital equipment. Butagain, I don't see any major longer-term effects. We are watching Europe quite a bit, particularly with the austerity measures. As youknow, many of the first things that get focused on and reduced are the amount of capital expenditures. And so, part of how we'vetaken a look at Neuro in Europe going into 2012 is to make sure that we have a very realistic view of what that growth rate can be."

At this point in time, we've had, as you know, we've spoken about in the past,Neuro tends to be one of our areas that we've had stronger overall pricing in the amount of the product lines based on the differentiatedvalue they bring, as well as just the structure of the market. That being said, with a lot of the economic factors around the world,there is definitely areas of the world where we're feeling more pressure than we have in the past.

But just in terms of the commentary aroundthe 2012 guidance, the revisions seemed more related to Europe. So, can you just kind of reconcile what the issue is, and maybewhen you look at 2012, what geographies will grow? What may be flattish?"

So, I'll give a little bit of a level, and then Jack, you may want to comment a little bit as well. And I think you understood it well,I mean, what caused some of the changes in Q4 were as we highlighted in the comments relative to some of the product approvalsand such. As we look forward out into 2012, we're more cautious about our Europe overall expectations, clearly in what we're lookingfor in our guidance. Some of the markets, such as traditional markets, such as Japan versus, say, China, we may be not as expectingas much growth out as a mature market as Japan as we might have six months ago. Latin America and some of the other markets,we see it still continuing actually aligned with our overall expectations. And then obviously there's the broader question of currencywith the strengthening of the overall dollar. But I think our main concern and focus is just ultimately where Europe is going to shapeup from a healthcare standpoint next year. Jack, I don't know if you want to add any color?"

And the rest is all over the place, which means that any given country, a pretty small decision can make a given country lookstrong or weak in a quarter.

And I think, Jayson, to the point Jack's going is our biggest components in Europe are some of the markets within Spain andItaly and such, where it's been tough. And so, we've been obviously expanding and we still have room to expand in other marketsand even traditional Europe as an example bring Spine new into Europe.

Just to wrap up on Extremity's, it sounds like the message from you guys is that, as far as you can tell,especially on the metal side, you're not really seeing any change to market trends relative to what you saw last quarter? Is that a fairrepresentation?"

And then on the Spine side, if you looked at it, at the business pro forma, assuming these acquisitions were fully in the numbersin the year-ago period, not surprisingly, it doesn't look like that business is growing, again, especially on the metal side. So, I guessmy question is, how long do you think it will take before you can realize the growth goals within that Spine division, especially onthe hardware side that you had envisioned? And I ask the question just because historically when I look at the companies that havetried to build through acquisitions in Spine, like BioMed and Zimmer, the process of integration and getting everything settled outhas taken a number of quarters, if not a well over a year before things settled out. So, within that context, I'm just curious as to yourexpectations for when and how you can get that business to grow the way you want it to."

We take a look at it from a hardware and an Orthobiologic standpoint, two things. First of all,to the point about getting the distribution structure settled, working cross-pollination, we really crossed that chasm in 2011, andthere was a significant amount of work that went into that. And we feel quite good about that structure. Just even, as you mentioned,the cross-pollination of products from one business to the other to the distribution structure, the amount of capital outlay and howwe've done that, I think we've done that responsibly and we have a good structure in place. That being said, the market is where the market is, and so part of our overall expectations for 2012 are to be a little bit cautiousrelative to the overall growth that we think is going to be achieved in Orthopedics, and keeping in mind that the majority of ourSpine business is heavily US weighted. As in the next few years, we're going to be growing outside. That being said, our Biologics     portfolio, which really adds, I think, quite a differentiator for us as other individual metal suppliers stand out there, is doing verynicely. And between our demineralized bone products, our mosaic product, and the expansion of distributors that we've been ableto bring into it, we see that as a major component of our growth for Spine really in 2012. And really our hope and strategy, whichhasn't changed, is bringing those two together that we can bring differentiated value. All that being said though, we've temperedsome of our overall expectations in 2012 just based on how we see the market. Jack, I don't know if you would like to add any other comments?"

In the case of this SeaSpine acquisition for us, there was very little overlap, and so we've had a fewplaces with sort of fights at the borderlands, but in general, it hasn't required the same kind of distributor bloodbath that you oftenget when you see a big company acquire a smaller Spine company."

I just had a question on -- I know you talked about the miss really came from the last threeweeks in the quarter, but can you just talk about that level of deterioration? I mean, it's pretty significant when it moves your EPSthat much below guidance for the quarter, so I was just curious about that could you add more color on that?"

On the top line,the point about the surprise versus our internal expectations, if you will, the speed of the deterioration came from really these threepoints we've identified. Half, or actually a bit more than half came from Instruments, and almost all of that was Alternate Site. Thatwas actually a few, call it, rifle shot decisions by big companies that we do business with. We could have -- in some circumstances,probably given away economics and gotten some of those revenues, and we made a decision not to do that. So, that was a prettyquick shortfall. The second impact, about a 0.25 of our internal disappointment was on international, and that was in, again, a few specific locations.Also some systematic stuff in Europe, but a few specific locations. And the third was Extremity's, which we've talked about at lengthon this call. So, that was the top line hit. Then as far as the adjusted EPS is concerned, there are people who have actually emailed in questions saying -- well, it seems thatthe range for that is a little low given the top line miss, that there ought to have been some effect. And that's straightforward math.We are mindful of the fact that at this very early stage in our financial reporting, to be very direct, there's a whole bunch of stuff we     have to finish doing, ranging from a lot of the end of the year testing, to the tax rate and so forth. And so we are being careful there.That follows a quarter in which, on the one hand, we had a tremendous amount going on, the Ascension integration, the remediationwork, and a number of other initiatives. And at the same time, we were focusing hard on expenses because obviously once youmove past Thanksgiving, we begin to see that it was not shaping up into at least an excellent quarter. So, Pete, I don't know if you want to elaborate on some of that, but that's how we think of all of that."

Obviously we've been taking a hard look at our broader expenses we'll continue to do so. I thinkfrom a strategy standpoint, we'll talk more about that and some of our focus areas actually next week with different investors andanalysts. I think just to reinforce Jack's point on the quarter, the surprise piece, our Instruments business is half Alt Site, half AcuteCare -- Acute Care with Spine. Alt Site, to give you some relative statistics, 30% of the year in the last few years has come in the fourthquarter, and a vast majority of that comes from distributors making buys really in the last three to four weeks. That didn't happen.That's what really caused the surprise. Now one may ask themselves -- gee, is you're forecasting structure as adequate as it shouldbe to see that? And the answer is obviously, no, it's not. So, we're doing things to change that to get more visibility to make surethat we understand it."

The questions that have come across, just wanted to make sure we're looking at this theright way. With the market kind of flat, and the combined businesses, because of some of the rationalization mitigation you beendoing, I guess the way we've been looking at it is that business on a combined basis has actually been down year over year as wekind of do the math to get to what we think organic growth could be next year. And where growth will settle out as you get throughthe final quarter or two of having cross-pollinated and maybe swapped out some products from those two businesses and swappedin some products. Does this settle into -- should we think about market growth for the remaining part of the year? Or putting asidethe integration, I'd love to get your sense as to what kind of account wins or action you're seeing in the market that would lead youto believe that you're either going to grow with the market, tail end of next year, or you're going to be potentially in a position togrow a bit better than the market?

And remind you of a couple items, and then I'm sure Pete will elaborate. So, I thinka couple of things. One, the Orthobiologics business is done particularly well, that's part of it. That may be the area where we havethe greatest edge. So, that's fully part of that business. Secondly, the mission of our Spine business is certainly to grow faster than the market. Now, whether that's fast enough, or whatthat translates to is partly a function of the argument you have over what's happening in the market. But it is certainly the objective     of that group to grow faster than the market, and they are seeing that the cross-pollinization of these products are -- it's attractiveto the dealers involved. So, we are optimistic that we can hold our own and do better, but that's not by any means a foregoneconclusion."

But we believe we can grow above it, I think mainly for one key reason. We had two separate distribution teamsthat had two separate product lines, both of those product lines weren't fully adequate to meet all of the needs, even in the surgeonsthat we're calling on, so they went to other products.We're already seeing, as we get the products cross-pollinated, that we're pickingup procedural growth with our current surgeons just because we can fill out the products that we have. Obviously on a go-forwardbasis, beyond that, picking up new surgeons and growing beyond that is what we need to be able to prove to ourselves and showthat we can grow and take share more broadly. But that's how we kind of take a look at the share growth in 2012. And the fact thatwe have our distribution structure settled, as well as our cross-pollination of our products well on their way, gives us confidence inthat area."
