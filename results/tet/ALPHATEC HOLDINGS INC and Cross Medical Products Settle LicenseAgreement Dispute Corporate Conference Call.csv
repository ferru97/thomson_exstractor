2,18595853,ALPHATEC HOLDINGS INC,01/06/2012,2:00PM,ATEC,ALPHATEC HOLDINGS INC and Cross Medical Products Settle LicenseAgreement Dispute Corporate Conference Call,Dirk Kuyper,"Alphatec Holding, Inc.",President & CEO,False,True,False,"Thank you, Mike good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning I'll provide some brief highlights on the settlement that weannounced with Cross Medical Products which is a subsidiary of Biomet, and then we'll open the call up for questions. We're pleased to announce that we've reached a global settlement agreement of two pending lawsuits.The first lawsuit, Cross Medical, had claimedthat Alphatec Spine had breached the April 23, 2003 licensing agreement with Cross Medical by failing to make certain royalty payments. In thesecond lawsuit Alphatec Spine had claimed that a subsidiary of Biomet infringed on a patent owned by Alphatec Spine. Under the terms of the settlement all parties obtained a release of all claims that were the subject of the disputes. No party has admitted liabilityin connection with the settlement. The settlement also includes an amendment to the April 23, 2003 license agreement. While we continue to believe in the strength of our position in this dispute, we felt that it served the best interest of our shareholders to proactivelysettle the matter to eliminate ongoing legal costs resulting from the litigation and remove any possibility of an unfavorable judgment that could'vehad a material adverse effect on the Company. As recent judgments in our industry have shown, there is an inherent uncertainty in the litigation process. In addition, in reaching a settlementagreement we can now fully focus our time and resources on executing on our 2012 business plan. As part of the settlement Alphatec Spine will pay Cross Medical an initial payment of $5 million in January 2012. In addition to the initial paymentAlphatec Spine will make 13 payments of $1 million with the payments made quarterly, and the first payment being due on August 1, 2012, andeach subsequent payment (technical difficulty) three months thereafter until the final payment, which is due August 1, 2015. A portion of the settlement expense will be applicable to the financial year 2011 and a portion applicable to subsequent periods.We'll provide theaccounting treatment as part of our 2011 year-end reporting and it will be incorporated in our 2012 guidance. In addition, pursuant to the settlement the parties have exchanged covenants not to sue for patent infringement with respect to products thateach respective company had on the market as of December 30, 2011. As you may recall, we generated $1.8 million in cash from operations in the third quarter. We've been public with our goal to generate cash forfull-year 2011 and I can confirm that the business accomplished this. As discussed in our third-quarter earnings call, our focus remains on growingrevenues faster than the category in regions where we compete, on improving our global gross margins, aggressively managing our operatingexpenses and a laser focus on cash flow generation. We announced several cost reduction initiatives which have resulted in incremental improvements in our cash flow in late 2011. We launched aset of three strategic initiatives aimed at improving our performance, the first is reducing our cost to goods sold and increasing efficiencies in ourUS operations second is reducing cost of goods sold in our international operations and third is reducing SG&A expenses internationally. The initiatives include insourcing currently outsourced manufacturing to maximize our capacity utilization and improve cash flow. Currently 80%of Scient'x implants are purchased as finished goods in the European Union and we have initiated transfer of high-volume products to our USproduction facility. Focusing on the vital few projects that most affect our success and elimination of duplications of efforts are other initiatives. All of these efforts aredriving incremental cash flow for the business in 2012.     We remain comfortable that we can meet the ongoing settlement obligations and continue to generate cash for the full-year 2012. Based uponthis we do not anticipate the need to raise additional capital now or in the future to fund our operation. In closing, it's important to point out that over the last 18 months Alphatec has gone through a major transformation into a global company. Duringthis period we have made substantive upgrades to the senior and international management teams and are clearly beginning to see the positiveimpacts from these changes. We're well positioned to take market share in the global spine market and to generate positive cash flow in 2012 and we remain committed to ourlonger-term goal of achieving a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin in the 20% range. As we transition to Q&A I want to be clear that this call will not be -- we will not be discussing or commenting further on either our fourth-quarterfinancial performance or guidance for 2012. We anticipate providing this information as part of the year-end conference call which should takeplace towards the end of February. Thank you and I'd now like to open the call up for your questions."

So good stuff. My one question has to dowith the level of wiggle room that you have to do other type of licensings and deals. In other words, you're telling us that you've got enough cashflow to now cover these payments which is great. But is there wiggle room to license innovative products like an OsseoFix or an OsseoScrew likeyou've done in the past? Thanks."

And we see that going forward into 2012. In a way the good news is that, because of the changes in the market,that the opportunity to license those types of products has become somewhat easier. So we don't see this as an impediment to us taking advantageof opportunities as they come up."

Where are these going to show up in the P&L? Will this be inCOGS or SG&A? And will the one-time charge -- will it be a one-time charge or do you amortize it over the balance of the settlement?"
9,18595853,ALPHATEC HOLDINGS INC,01/06/2012,2:00PM,ATEC,ALPHATEC HOLDINGS INC and Cross Medical Products Settle LicenseAgreement Dispute Corporate Conference Call,Michael O'Neill,"Alphatec Holding, Inc.","CFO, VP & Treasurer",True,False,False,The accounting treatment on the -- or how the settlement will appear in the P&L is still to be determined. It is a complex calculation on how muchof that would hit a charge in 2011 versus how much would appear in subsequent periods. But the licensing agreement expires at the end of 2013.So that would be the end of any P&L impact. It would normally show up -- ordinarily royalties show up as a piece of cost of goods sold.Whether this shows up there in future periods and whetherthe one-time charge shows up there remains to be seen given the nature of the settlement. But it is still a TBD as far as we're concerned at thispoint. But we'll be very clear when we come out with 2012 guidance as to what the impact is and where it shows up in the P&L.
10,18595853,ALPHATEC HOLDINGS INC,01/06/2012,2:00PM,ATEC,ALPHATEC HOLDINGS INC and Cross Medical Products Settle LicenseAgreement Dispute Corporate Conference Call,Bill Plovanic,Canaccord Genuity,Analyst,True,False,False,"And secondly for Dirk. Just as I look at this settlement, the challenge you have here is we're coming out of this and you turn profitable and hadcash flow you could finally start reinvesting in the business and grow it. With this settlement you're basically taking -- half of your free cash flowper quarter for the next year or two and having to pay it out rather than reinvest it in the business. How do you propose accelerating growth oroutgrowing the market without the cash flow to reinvest in the business to do so?"
11,18595853,ALPHATEC HOLDINGS INC,01/06/2012,2:00PM,ATEC,ALPHATEC HOLDINGS INC and Cross Medical Products Settle LicenseAgreement Dispute Corporate Conference Call,Dirk Kuyper,"Alphatec Holding, Inc.",President & CEO,True,False,False,"Well, clearly we're very focused on increasing the amount of cash flow per quarter and have spent a lot of time and effort in 2011 positioning theCompany appropriately to do that. And we clearly are very focused on doing that in 2012 and on a go-forward basis. So we feel very good aboutour ability to increase our cash flow as we move forward. So we believe we will have the resources we need to reinvest. As I said in 2011, even though we turned the corner in terms of generating positivecash flow in total for the year, it wasn't substantive. But we were able to invest in the business as we needed to in order to grow. So we really don't see this impeding our ability to organically grow in 2012 and continue to take share. Obviously we would have preferred for itnot to happen, but it's well within our plan."

Is that what you're telling me?"

Meaning is theexisting plan sufficient to offset some of the margin you're now sacrificing with this settlement? Or do you feel like the process might need to geta little more aggressive in the future to hit some of the margin targets that you have in mind? Thanks."

We obviously have been very focused on setting this business up the right way going forward to both improvemargins and improve cash flow. And we don't see the settlement requiring us to make any additional drastic actions at this point. Within all of thechanges that we've been making we feel very comfortable. We don't see the need to do anything in addition to what we had already planned."

And then just sort of a follow up to all the questions on your margin expansion initiatives. I think you've been talking about these for a quarteror so now, perhaps a bit longer I think. But we haven't yet seen them materialize. Even in the third quarter I think gross margins took a little bit ofa step back and even SG&A spending as well. So as we look here into 2012 when do you think we'll start to see some material benefits from these initiatives maybe improve the margin structureof the Company, the cash generation?"

But we're beginning to see improvements in gross margin now and we would anticipate continuing to see that as the year unfolds.

But with respect to some of the approval processes and the discussions that you've gotongoing with the FDA, there's some discussion moving some of those from 510(k) submissions to PMA type submissions. How does your cashposition affect your ability to basically move those programs forward? Or could we expect some slowing down in the regulatory process relatingto new product?"

Obviously that's something we need to evaluate very carefully.We've obviously got some very innovativeproducts in the pipeline and we're going through the assessment in terms of our ability to handle clinical studies within this framework. We haveplanned to increase our spending in clinicals in 2012 well within our plan. Again, I think a lot of the actions we took in the third quarter were really designed to reduce spending where we didn't need it so that we wouldhave room to operate where we didn't need to increase spending and clinical is one of those areas.     So I think the answer to your question is we're evaluating that. And certainly I think as we get to the year-end and 2012 guidance call we'll be ableto provide a more thorough update on that. But at this point our intention is to bring those innovative products to market in the US."
