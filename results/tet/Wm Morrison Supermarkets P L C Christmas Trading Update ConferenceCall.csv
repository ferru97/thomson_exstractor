(Operator Instructions). Later we will conduct a question and answer session.Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, CEO Dalton Philips. Sir, you may begin."
1,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,False,True,False,"Thank you and good morning, everybody. Sorry we're starting a little bit late. The lines are incredibly busy so we're just trying to get most peoplein, although there's still a large number trying to get in but I'm going to start anyway. So joining on this call this morning is Richard Pennycook, and we're going to be talking about the pre-close trading update for the six weeks toJanuary 1. Today we'll focus solely on our sales performance over the Christmas period, so hopefully this will be a fairly straightforward call. At our prelims inMarch we'll update you on our progress with our various initiatives and outline our plans for the future. As you will have seen from the release, we traded well during a tough Christmas period. A record 800,000 additional customers shopped with useach week this Christmas, with our sales over Christmas now over 40% higher than they were just five years ago. Before taking your questions, let me set the scene. You will recall that when we started this year, we expected 2011 to be challenging. It certainlyturned out that way, and Christmas has been no exception. Consumer confidence continues to be very low. For December, the GfK NOP reading dipped to minus 33. And let me remind you that in the 37years the index has been running it, it has only been lower on two occasions, a single month in 1990, and eight months during the trough of the2008/2009 recession. Against this backdrop, we are pleased to have delivered sales in line with the market. And most importantly, we provided our customers with thehigh quality food at the value prices they needed this Christmas.     There were some notable sales patterns this year which were indicative of the market conditions. We saw Christmas coming later. Clearly, it alwaysfalls on the 25th, but we have seen the percentage of sales in the final seven days rise by more than one-quarter over the last two years. As customers shop later, we also saw them take advantage of our fresh offer for their traditional favorites.There was a 3% swing from frozen turkeyto fresh turkey, with an overall 9% growth in the number of whole fresh turkeys sold. So overall, we were pleased to achieve a good like-for-like sales uplift over the Christmas period. We've a strong program already in place forJanuary, including our free shopping campaign and the introduction of our new M Savers range. And as you will have seen, we are on track todeliver our full-year profit expectations. I'm also pleased to say that we're making good progress on our strategic initiatives, and we'll be talking about that in a couple of months' time atour prelims. So now let's move to your questions. Operator?"

Firstly on inflation, could you just give us a clue as to how that moved in the period whether that came down a littlebit? And secondly, not necessarily just for Morrison but for the sector, for the industry as a whole, what would a realistic level of like-for-like growth beto expect for 2012 do you think?"
4,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Richard Pennycook,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CFO,True,False,False,"Good morning. It's Richard. I'll take those. We don't, as you know, break out inflation specifically, but we've talked about the fact that in the run-into Christmas, it was still pretty stubborn. It was around -- what we saw though was a very promotional Christmas with some record weeks in termsof promotional participation helping just to take the edge off those inflationary pressures for the customer. As far as 2012 is concerned, a bit like the conversation we had this time last year.We're expecting overall market growth levels to be pretty subdued,and that's how we're planning our business."

We've started to see some movements there inproteins produce. And, obviously, non-food was very deflationary over the Christmas period."

9,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,True,False,False,It's Dalton. We will. We'll confirm that.

11,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Richard Pennycook,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CFO,True,False,False,"Jaime, it's Richard.We're well on track with the program. It's GBP1 billion over the two years. And in terms of the momentum on the program, we'reback in the market again today with that. We remain very comfortable to get that done over the two years to March '13."
12,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Jaime Vazquez,Santander,Analyst,True,False,False,"I thought that in the third quarter trading statement call, you not only commented to GBP1 billion in two years, but to [have GBP1 billion] by March.Should we forget about the second part of the commitment?"
13,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Richard Pennycook,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CFO,True,False,False,"No, we'll keep the momentum going. But precisely where we land at March obviously we'll tell you on the day. Volumes in the market have beenvery low in our share shares. We can only go at a sensible pace to run the program, but we're committed to getting it done."
14,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Jaime Vazquez,Santander,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay. And finally, there's an article in the FT today suggesting that you're interested in 11 Best Buy sites in retail parks. Can you make a comment,or at least say whether you are looking at it?"
15,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,True,False,False,"I'm afraid we can't comment specifically on that speculation.What we can do, Jaime, which we said actually before Christmas, is that we're ambitiousfor Kiddicare. We can see real growth in that business. We like it very much. And if there's an opportunity out there to accelerate that growth, wewill take it. But I can't comment on specific situations."
16,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Jaime Vazquez,Santander,Analyst,True,False,False,"So in principle, you are not against the idea of expanding non-food in stores, in specialized stores."
17,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,True,False,False,"I think I've been quite vocal on this issue that we just don't see non-food being sold in bricks and mortar, certainly not in food stores. I think Kiddicareis a very different proposition, and we've got a large store down in Peterborough. It's one of the largest kids' stores in all of Europe. It's quite a tactilepurchase. It's an emotional purchase. [You need to think about it because this is expensive. So Kiddicare is a great example of multi-channel. People go to the store, think about it, go home, buy it online. And so it's a proposition think IKEA,think Apple that lends itself well to having a very small number of physical outlets, but I can't comment on the Best Buy, obviously. But ScottWeavers-Wright was quite vocal about it before Christmas saying this is a business that can grow. And we're very ambitious for it. We've spent[GBP70 million] on it, and we're going to grow this thing."
18,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Jaime Vazquez,Santander,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay, that's very clear. Thanks very much."

Could you give us some color to your description of sharp prices within the industry, and how you see the pricing environmentyear on year going into 2012, or in 2012? And could you also confirm whether you had positive or negative like-for-like volumes in the six-week period, please?"
21,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,True,False,False,"Okay, Clive. We are very comfortable with our value proposition, and we have had very sharp pricing all year.You'll remember we started with FuelBritannia about this time last year, and then into Price Crunch, so we've always had sharp pricing. It's a market that has a lot of sharp pricing in it,none more so than Christmas which was extremely competitive, and we see that competitive cut and thrust continuing into this year that's coming. So no change there, and that's why if you're not on the right price you're not going to do well. And it's also how we've seen customers shop. AndI'll give you a good example people trading our champagne into sparkling wine. That's an example of people trading into joints of protein, likepork, for example, out of more expensive protein. So that sort of thing. And in terms of volume, you know we don't break it out, but you've had low like for likes. And the market in general has had negative volumes, soyou can draw your own conclusions."
22,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Clive Black,Shore Capital,Analyst,True,False,False,"And just in terms of that trading environment, pricing environment, would you say that the Tesco Big Price Drop initiative where they're seekingto seemingly lower promotional activity for price, and Asda's pricing activity has particularly led to any switching, or share loss for you? It looks likeAsda has had a very strong festive trading period."
23,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,True,False,False,"Well, you've got to play tunes at Christmas, Clive, and our job, Richard and I and the rest of the team here, our job is to chart a course which is smartsales. And that's what we've been focused on this Christmas.We've had a solid performance. If you look at our like for like on transactions, customercount is up nearly 5%, 4.8%. So obviously, we were watching what was going on with our competitors, but we are maintaining our full-year guidance. We've had a crackingyear. We've been growing strongly all year, and we had to trade through Christmas and anticipate what was coming at us, and deal with that."
24,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Clive Black,Shore Capital,Analyst,True,False,False,"Okay. Thanks for that, and all the best for the New Year."

We really would rather do that at the prelims in March. This is just a sales update, so forgive us. That said, the plans that we've talkedabout before are very much on track, but we'll give the detail for that in March."

So for us aswe look at the business, we've got growth everywhere. It's a little bit stronger in the south, but not an order of magnitude different."
32,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Sam Hart,Charles Stanley,Analyst,True,False,False,"Is there any particular reason why you think trading is holding up in the north? A lot of the anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that the north isbeing -- well, suffering more in the current economic environment."

It's clearly very important in areas of country that are particularly challenged interms of the household budget, and that's where through 2011 I think we've shown real success in having that very strong focus on value."

Firstly, can you just give us a rough idea of the entry rate versus the exit rate for the like for like? And secondly, as fuel is now coming off, are you seeing the spend return to in-store? Clearly, one of the arguments last year was that fuel was sohigh that the like for like in total was good and you would hope to see that return in store. But looking at the industry slowdown, it doesn't appearthat that's the case. Can you just give us an idea of the kind of trend you're seeing in terms of the customer? Are they just stopping the buyingprocess in total in store and not replicating that exchange back as you maybe have hoped? More of an industry question."
37,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Richard Pennycook,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CFO,True,False,False,"Matt, let me take the entry/exit point. Forgive me, but I'm not going to get into that level of detail.This trading update is the six weeks of Christmas,which is a relatively short time span anyway. But the other point I'd make, which you're well aware of, is the trading patterns change greatly becauseof Christmas falling on the Sunday and we're, all of us, up against some weather effects from the previous year. So when you look at those individualtrading patterns around the period, it really is very difficult to unpick and I'd suggest that there's limited upside in trying to do that."
38,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,True,False,False,"And on the fuel, Matt, we would expect some of that to start coming back in. As you know, fuel is literally a fixed cost, and with prices starting todrop, we'd like to see some of that coming through. Not seeing that at the moment. I think people are up to their eyes now with carrying debtsover from Christmas, so I don't think you're going to see much of that until February, if you do see it at all."

Can you just specify if there were any specificcalendar effects and whether they're positive or negative during the period? You mentioned in reply to Matt's question regarding Christmas falling on the Sunday. If you could just talk through the calendar effects, that wouldbe very helpful."
42,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,True,False,False,"Al, you certainly didn't miss that point. We just addressed it briefly in the context of Matt's question as well. Christmas came very late because ofthat big shopping opportunity on the Saturday before Christmas, so I suspect that will be a theme of comments that you hear over the next weekor two. But in a way, you'd expect that because of that Saturday shopping opportunity that people had."
43,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Alastair Johnston,Citi,Analyst,True,False,False,But it doesn't change the overall level of sales year on year for the Christmas period. It just shifts it around within the Christmas period. Is thatcorrect or --?

45,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,True,False,False,"Yes, that's the expectation. We obviously, all of us, wait to see market stats. We had some out on Friday from Nielsen, but the fact that they werejust up to the 24th itself, with an extra trading day in the numbers they were talking about, I don't think allows anybody really to get under the skinof it. We've got Kantar tomorrow, and I guess everyone will look at that with interest."
46,18607812,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Richard Pennycook,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CFO,True,False,False,"I think what you might have missed on the beginning there, Al, was this point that I made that the last seven days saw a marked uplift in the amountof sales falling into that seven days if you compare it to previous years. So it was up 25% on two years ago, the amount that fell in those last sevendays. Now clearly, part of that is Christmas on a Sunday, but not all of it, and it just shows the extent to which people were holding off, holding off,holding off and then spending at the last moment."
