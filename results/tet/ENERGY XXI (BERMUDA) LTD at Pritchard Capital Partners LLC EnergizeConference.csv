Thanks, Stephen. Thanks, Pritchard, for this opportunity. It's always good. I'll walk you through Energy XXI, what we've got going on today real quick, just a quick snapshot of the Company. We're going right on sixthanniversary actually as an operating company. In that short time, we have built it into an almost $3 billion market cap company. We're the thirdlargest producer in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, primarily producing oil about two-thirds of that is oil. The latest quarter, the September quarter,produced just shy of 41,000 BOE a day and we're on target to show some good growth in the December quarter as we've told people. Again, oil focused, producing oil that's getting a nice premium, not just WTI but actually premium to Brent. So today we're getting about $115 abarrel for oil and spinning off cash flow at an amazing pace. A quick look at where those properties are. We set out to build the Company as an acquire and exploit model chasing after large, mature oilfieldswith the thought being not so much that we were bullish oil, although we have all always have been, but as engineers we can get a lot more outof an old, a big old oil field than you can get out of a natural gas field, particularly in smaller fields as well because the big fields give you anopportunity to drain an undrained fault block that is meaningful whereas a small one obviously is not worth your time. So we've been very successfulwith that. You can see the properties are all located on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, offshore, primarily all offshore Louisiana. It's not by chance that's where theoil tends to be because the dump of the Mississippi River. So you can see the fields in green are oil and the few in red as well. Of course, we'redrilling some very highly prospective natural gas wells with the McMoRan partnership right now that could certainly make us more gassy in thefuture but we're okay with the giant size of the targets you've got there in the economics involved. But bottom line, we operate six of the 11 largest oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and have an interest in a seventh. So you can see that theoriginal focus is paying off very well. On a proved reserves basis, we're just shy of 117 million barrels of oil equivalent with a present value run on recent strip in excess of our currentmarket cap alone, not to mention the value the probables and possibles that we have captured in addition. I would highlight the value of some of those probables particularly is extraordinary because more than a third of those are associated with currentlyproducing well bores, which means essentially you don't spend another dime to move those volumes from probable into proved. As you produce,you are proved and the water contact hasn't been hit yet. Those probable volumes move into the proved category. You can see what we have been able to do over the time organically and of course through acquisitions, the most recently being December 17,2010 just over a year ago then, the Exxon Mobil properties. I'll talk quite a bit about those core properties as we go through."
