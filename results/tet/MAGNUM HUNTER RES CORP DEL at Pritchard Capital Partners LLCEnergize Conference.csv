1,18608914,MAGNUM HUNTER RESOURCES CORP,01/04/2012,11:45PM,MHR,"MAGNUM HUNTER RES CORP DEL at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC""Energize` Conference",Gary Evans,Magnum Hunter Resources Corp.,Chairman and CEO,False,True,False,"Thank you, Scott. Some forward-looking statements. Today Magnum Hunter is about a $750 million market capitalization enterprise, about a $1.1 billion enterprise, $750 million market cap. We didannounce, I guess, during the holidays that we markedly beat our year-end production exit rate, which was 10,000 BOE a day. We were over 12.5,and we upped our 2013, or 2012, I should say, exit rate to 14.5. So total reserves today are about 37 million barrels. It looks like with our drillingefforts, we are adding about 1 million barrels a month to our total reserve base. That is based on the last year of what we have been achieving. Wealso identified resource potential of about 500 million barrels, and we have over 4000 drilling locations in our inventory. Magnum Hunter today is really a truly unconventional resource company that is all we do. We are focused in these three plays that you all wellknow. Our job now that we have accumulated our acquisitions and leases is to become a drilling factory, and I think that is what the market is finallybeginning to realize, that we have a lot of technology in-house and have done, I think, a decent job in showing how we can develop these assets. So this is a map just depicting our acreage position. We are continuing to add acreage in the Eagle Ford. We have some transactions working rightnow in the Utica to increase that acreage position. We are working on some in the Marcellus, some in the Bakken. So all areas we are continuingto build upon. We don't really have any significant acquisition plans because we have such a large inventory. Our goal really is just to grow withinour existing portfolio. If you are going to be in resource plays -- this is a Credit Suisse slide showing where you ought to be, and we are in the three top. We are, I wouldtell you, very concerned about natural gas prices. That is one reason we have put a lot of hedges in place in the last 60 days for 2012 and 2013. Weare actually having a management retreat over the next three days to discuss how we might realign our budget to more of our oil plays. So ourbudget today is $200 million, $150 million upstream, $50 million up stream, divided equally in the three divisions, and I can tell you that will definitelychange over the next month. So this is our production growth that we have experienced since the first quarter of this year, and where we anticipate exiting at the end of 2012.And I'm sure those numbers will gradually go up as we continue to produce these new properties.This is where we ended up in the last six monthscoming from July to our fourth quarter estimate of 12.5, and where that production profile came from. Reserves, we have been doing reserve reports now every 6 months, because our reserves are growing so fast. That has enabled us to have -- wehad five different borrowing base increases with our Bank group in 2011. We are getting ready to go through another one here in the next 30 to45 days. Our reserves have been finalized by our engineering firms and will be disclosed here in the next few weeks, but I can tell you we are over40 million barrels. So, again, we are adding about 1 million barrels a month. So let's dive down a little deeper in the three plays. The Williston Basin is predominantly from our NuLoch acquisition, completed in May of thispast year. We have got total proved reserves of about 8.2 million barrels, of which PDP is only 3.7. It's about a 19-year reserve life, mostly crude. We"
