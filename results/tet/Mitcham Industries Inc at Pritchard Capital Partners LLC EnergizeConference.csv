1,18608610,MITCHAM INDUSTRIES INC.,01/04/2012,6:30PM,MIND,"Mitcham Industries Inc at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC ""Energize`Conference",Bill Mitcham,"Mitcham Industries, Inc.",CEO and President,False,True,False,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Mitcham, and a very special thank you to all of you from PritchardCapital for having us again this year. We appreciate your support over the years. As Bill said, I'm Bill Mitcham, President and CEO of Mitcham Industries, and with me today is Rob Capps, our EVP of Finance and CFO. I'll give youa brief overview of the Company and Rob will follow with financial information and a wrap-up. Then if you have any questions, we'll be happy tomeet with you in the breakout room. Our business is pretty simple. It consists of two segments -- seismic Equipment Leasing and sales of Seamap equipment that we manufacture. Sinceour founding in 1987, we have grown to be the world's largest independent lessor of seismic equipment. No other leasing or rental company inthe seismic industry approaches the breadth or scale of the equipment that we have to offer. Our customers are the worldwide seismic contractorsand a few -- and the large oilfield service companies. We currently have nine locations around the world, which allows us to provide equipment24 hours a day, 7 days week, quickly and efficiently to meet our customers' needs. Through our Seamap unit, we design, manufacture and sell certain specialized equipment for the marine seismic industry. I guess I should havegone up one slide, right? There we go, sorry there's the overview slide, missed it. So now you can see from this that you can see our -- quit laughing,Miles. So you can see here we trade under the symbol MIND. Our market cap -- you see it -- over the first nine months of this year, we have alreadysurpassed our complete year-end -- last year revenues. We continue to see an increasing demand for oil and gas throughout the world. This demand will drive increased exploration activity, many moreseismic surveys. The more seismic that we see -- all the seismic surveys are requiring higher channel counts, higher equipment on each job, andthat's equipment that we believe that the contractors will continue to rent. The demand will be the same on the marine side of our business --more streamers in the water, more energy sources on each vessel. This trend also drives higher demand for our Seamap equipment products aswell as marine rentals. We are also seeing seismic used in new applications, such as frac monitoring, life of field monitoring, which utilize ourdownhole equipment and some surface seismic. This slide is the seismic market it kind of gives you an idea. There are several companies here that are presenting this week. And it kind of givesyou an idea of how we compare to them in terms of products and the services we offer.     Seamap continues to see great demand for their GunLink and BuoyLink products.This demand comes from rigging out of new vessels, contractorsmoving to newer leading-edge technology and our existing customer base upgrading to newer and more advanced versions of our GunLinkproducts. So over the past few years, our strategic planning has helped guide us through the recovery years and it positions us well for the growth cycle wenow see in the seismic industry. Over the past six years we have added over $200 million of new equipment, latest state-of-the-art cable andcable-free recording systems, downhole tools and digital sensors. We've had experienced personnel into our organization and we have expandedgeographically. Our newest facility in Budapest, Hungary was just opened in October of last year to serve the Eastern European area, and we havemore than 10,000 channels and peripherals on lease in that region already. We also have recently expanded our facility in Bogota, Colombia, andadded additional equipment to meet new demand there. The operating leverage inherent in our leasing model simply means that an increase in utilization by approximately 5 percentage points increasesour operating income by almost $10 million. Now, that's a real number and we work hard every day to increase that number. Seamap brings an added dimension to our rental business with strong recurring profits and best-in-class products. During the third quarter wealmost doubled the size of our facility there in Singapore. We expanded -- the expanded facility will provide space for our marine lease pool thatwe're housing there and provide Seamap with dearly needed additional expanded manufacturing facilities. Now I'm going to turn the podium over to Rob, and he's going to walk you through some of our financials."
2,18608610,MITCHAM INDUSTRIES INC.,01/04/2012,6:30PM,MIND,"Mitcham Industries Inc at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC ""Energize`Conference",Rob Capps,"Mitcham Industries, Inc.",EVP of Finance and CFO,False,True,False,"Okay, thanks, Bill. As Bill said, I'll just walk through some of the financial information quickly for you. Fiscal 2012 has been a good year for us so far. In the first nine months of the fiscal year, we reported rack or results in terms of revenues, EBITDA,EPS, pretty much every metric we have. Now one thing to keep in mind, that we are a January year-end, so the fiscal 2012 is ending in this month.So the nine months we talk about was ended on October 31. Now, these year-to-date results, we think, are really being driven by strong fundamentals in the seismic industry in general, increased demand inSouth America, improvement in the US, increased marine demand as well as excellent results in Seamap, as Bill talked about. And one thing topoint out is the third quarter this year was the best quarter we've ever had. And that's very unusual in that typically our first fiscal quarter is ourstrongest, due to seasonal factors. So this is the first year in our history that our third quarter has been better than our first in terms of leasing results.We really think this demonstrates the strong revenue generating capacity that we have put into the business in the past several years. Let's take a look at total revenues, and it really gives you a picture of the long-term growth we have seen in our revenue and our top line as wellas the dramatic growth we've seen in the last two years. Again, remember these -- our fiscal year ends on January 31, just to keep it in perspective.You will notice the decline we saw in our fiscal 2009-2010 correlate to the global economic downturn that really kicked off in the fall of 2008.We'veseen a strong rebound from that. EBITDA obviously tracks revenue pretty closely, in our case. Depreciation is by far our largest cost, so therefore we look at EBITDA as one of our keyperformance metrics. Very important characteristics of our business is our strong cash flow generating capacity, as we demonstrate here. If youlook at the results year to date, for the first nine months we had EBITDA of over $41 million, which was a record and represents an EBITDA marginof about 54%, just over 54%. And as Bill mentioned or alluded to, the EBITDA for the first nine months of the year exceeded any previous full fiscalyear in the Company's history. Core leasing revenues is one of the key metrics for us, so this is our rental revenue with no equipment sales whatsoever. And again, we see thedownturn. In 2010, we are coming out pretty strongly on the heels of that in that fiscal 2011 and so far, fiscal 2012. Again, first nine months are arecord for us in leasing revenues, up 93% from the previous year. And as with EBITDA, our leasing revenues year-to-date for nine months exceededany previous full fiscal year."
