If I could start maybe and see if you can quantify for us the impact that Arbor Mist and Vendage hadon your overall focus brand depletions."
2,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Yes. It actually had quite a significant impact and if we stripped out just those two brands, we would have gained share in the overallcategory, wine category, for the quarter. That really has been a big driver of our overall market share loss in total wine.     Now if you look at just table wine, we did gain share in the quarter, and if you look at premium plus, we gained share in the quarter,too. I mention that because clearly, the premium plus category above $5 is our primary focus."

And then also just a follow-up on quantification. Is there any way for you to give us some context on what growth may havebeen on shipments, excluding the inventory build from -- at Crown last year?"
4,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,False,True,False,"Yes, this is Bob, Kaumil. I don't think we can get into that kind of detail."
5,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Kaumil Gajrawala,UBS,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay. No problem.Then just clarifying something on your guidance for Crown.You said improved sales growth and marketing spendto moderate. Just want to understand, because was that from a depletions perspective, or is that from a shipments perspective. Also,was the increased volume last year in 4Q also the replenishment of the supply issues?"
6,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,False,True,False,"Yes. So, the replenishment of the supply chain issues in the beer business was done by the end of the fourth quarter -- I mean thethird quarter. The fourth quarter, from a shipment-depletion perspective was pretty clean. Okay. So, we expect to -- for shipmentsin depletions, to continue to have pretty good growth in the fourth quarter. Now this year, one of the reasons that the beer business's EBIT is down is incremental marketing spend. You'd think the majority ofthat is behind us, as this year they spent the wide majority of that incremental monies in the peak summer season so in Q2, Q3. That's why I said Q4, we expect continued or even slightly better sales growth, which would -- the same as depletion growth for thefourth quarter, and reduced marketing, as opposed to the previous year."
7,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Kaumil Gajrawala,UBS,Analyst,False,True,False,Got it. And final question on prioritization of the free cash flow. You now have $100 million more than planned. Should we -- givenhow often you talked about the buy-back in your prepared remarks -- should we assume that much of that can go toward incrementalbuy-back?
8,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,False,True,False,"Yes. I mean our Board authorization is still at the $500 million level, and we have a little bit over $200 left on that. We don't have anyadditional Board authorization at this point. But as usual, we'll be looking at the market general trends to see whether we should beout there buying back more of our shares."

Rob, just on the wine business, just as you think about the payback that you've gotten in the current quarter fromhigher promotions. Obviously depletions improved sequentially, but it seems like it sort of came at the expense of higher promos.Can you maybe help us understand, do you think you've got enough payback on those spendings? What will the competitiveenvironment look like? Then as you look out in fiscal 2013 with a lot of these new products coming in line, how should we think about the promotionalspending? Then is 2013 finally the year where you think you can get the wine business to grow in category growth?"
12,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Yes, so I think in terms of payback on promotional spending, we certainly feel that we are getting a payback, and you can sort of seeit as a result of the sequential improvement in growth when we increase promotional spending. Now, we do also mitigate that to a degree and fund it by taking some of the actions which we've taken, such as increasing net priceon our value brands, where we frankly don't care that much about share, to help fund and offset some of the costs of promoting ourpremium plus portfolio. But in general, yes, promotional expense is up net, net, net, and yes, we think that it is paying back, givenwhere we would otherwise be if we didn't do so. What was your second question, Judy?"
13,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Judy Hong,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,False,True,False,"So, if that's the case--"
14,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,False,True,False,"As far as growing with the category next year, our plan is certainly to grow in line with the category next year, and as we buildmomentum this year and are either -- depending on the category -- exceeding category growth rates or nearing total categorygrowth rates, we should go into next year with good momentum to achieve that."
15,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Judy Hong,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay. And then Bob, just in terms of the whole shipment versus depletion delta on the wine business, are we completely now donejust in terms of the distortions in the fourth quarter? Are we still to start off cleanly as depletions matches shipments at your wholesalerlevel?"
16,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,False,True,False,"Yes, I'd say the wide majority of it is done. There could still be some adjustments for the fourth quarter, because what we've said isfor the full year, shipments will equal depletions, right? So, you kind of adjust in the fourth quarter to get to the full-year balance."
17,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Judy Hong,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay. And then on the Crown side, just any updated thinking just in terms of how you're thinking about pricing? Clearly your depletiontrends have been pretty healthy, but the margins have not really followed through. Just how you're thinking about pricing at thispoint?"
18,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,False,True,False,"Yes, good question. So, as we know, the beer category has been experiencing negative volumes. The larger domestic players havebeen taking some pricing. We actually at the Crown business took some front-line pricing in October. Not as much as the domesticplayers, and the pricing was different by brands and by geographies. But the other thing that the Crown business is doing is reducing its promotion spending, which is in essence, an increase in the netprice to the consumer. Now that reduced promotion spending is reinvested in marketing. So, that's why when you see the Crownincome statement, you'll see a pretty big increase in marketing expense, because there's two things going on there. There's money coming from promotion down into marketing, and there's the incremental funding that's occurring on the CrownP&L versus the prior year. So it's a pretty big increase in the marketing spend. Looking at how volumes and how dollars sales growth has been doing versus the category, it seems to be being pretty successful.And the marketing's been pretty well received, Rob gave some of those awards. I think those guys are doing a great job in feelinggood about their top line. I think the marketing overlaps from prior year are kind of hurting the bottom line. But that should abateas we go into next year."

Earnings Conference Call",Judy Hong,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,False,True,False,"So, if you take the front-line pricing and the reduced promo spending on Crown, the net price per barrel would have been up sortof 1% to 2% kind of level?"
20,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,False,True,False,"That's probably about right, maybe on the high end of that."

Earnings Conference Call",Bob Ryder,Constellation Brands Inc,EVP and CFO,False,True,False,"Judy, you can kind of look at IRI and look at the volume growth versus the net sales growth. You'll see that the net pricing to theconsumer in IRI is up just north of 2%, which is less than the domestic guys, but still pretty healthy, especially when you comparethat to how the volumes are doing to prior year."

Earnings Conference Call",Dara Mohsenian,Morgan Stanley,Analyst,False,True,False,"You mentioned innovation is one of the primary drivers to drive, improve wine market share trends going forward. I think previouslyyou had thought that would play out this holiday season. I just want to get a sense from you on how much of an increase in innovationcontribution you're expecting in calendar 2012 versus 2011, or the pipeline of innovation you have planned versus this year, and ifthere's a significant ramp-up going forward?"
28,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Yes, we expect pretty significant increase in the contribution of innovation to our growth in next year, whether it's calendar 2012 orfiscal 2013. Almost probably double the rate of the contribution that innovation made in 2012 or calendar 2011. As I mentioned in my talk, we have very ramped up new product initiatives and expect to introduce almost 20 new products intothe market place. This year, it contributed roughly 200 basis points or 2% to our overall growth, and next year it should -- as I said,contribute significantly more."

And can you give us an update on your thoughts for the pricing environment in the wine category as we lookout to calendar 2012 year, and an update on the promotional environment?"
30,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Yes. I would say starting with the promotional environment and the holiday season, it has been fairly consistent with how thingshave played out through the year, and basically with last year. Now, as you are aware from previous calls, this year's harvest in California was down, and in certain areas and in certain varietals,oversupply is turning into under-supply, especially in the north coast.     As a consequence of that, I would say that we probably think that you will see some pricing being taken on, especially higher-endproducts that are suffering from some of the under-supply. Now, that said, are we seeing any widespread examples of that? No. I've put that just more in the category of what people think, asopposed to what's really happening, so we're going to be watching it very carefully as we go into next year to see what's happeningout there in the market place."

Earnings Conference Call",Dara Mohsenian,Morgan Stanley,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay, and are you anticipating adjusting pricing at all on the value wines given some of the demand elasticity issues, or are you morefocused on profitability at this point?"

Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,False,True,False,"We kind of pulse that activity, so we've taken some pricing up on some of the value wines, and then we've taken some of the pricingback down on the value wines, depending on whether we think we're getting the benefit from the pricing or not, over an appropriateperiod of time. It can kind of go both ways, but in general, I would say that we're going to be more inclined to price value wines thanthe opposite, meaning take pricing down or drive for volume or share."

Just Rob, wondering how you think about the dollar price point positioning of your portfolio now versus the winecategory. It seems to me that it skews more favorably up the price point than it did several years ago. That's been kind of where thegrowth is in the wine sector. Why shouldn't we think that you would out-perform the overall wine category in 2013, or fiscal 2013, I should say?"
36,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Well, again, whether we gain share or lose share in the category, it will be very dependent on sort of the decisions we make as tohow do we price various elements of our portfolio. Our portfolio is large, we've got a lot of wines -- and I'll say outside of mainstream categories -- whether it is beverage, dessert wines,kosher wines, fruit-flavored varietal wines. We are very tactical in our decisions from a financial perspective as to whether to optmore for pricing or whether to opt more for value.     I would say that sort of the best measure of how we're doing overall is how we're doing on our focus brands, which is a relativelysmall portfolio of 17 brands, and constitutes the vast majority of our profitability in the United States. There, we're particularlyinterested in whether we're gaining or losing share. Now that said, one of the focus brands is the value brand. It is Arbor Mist. It's a big brand. As I have said, we have made the decisionand we did so last year -- this year, in actuality of the current year -- to tactically raise prices on that particular brand, and to sacrificethe volume which did impact the overall growth rate of the focus brand. So, it's sum and sum."

And just a quick one on some of the brands that you used to own over at Sentia. Any -- I hear that some of those are eitheron the block or somewhat distressed. Any thoughts on that? You've managed those brands before. Would it make sense to look atthem again?

For us, we've probably gained share on adollar perspective and lost share on a volume perspective because we've significantly changed the mix of product that we're sellingin the on-premise to more high-end, premium plus product from I'd say lower end. So the on-premise is rebounding, it is up a bit we believe overall and we believe we're gaining share from a dollar perspective."

My question has to do with the focus brand strategy. Specifically, while I recognize that the wine category is highlyfragmented so you need a number of offerings to compete effectively. I do wonder a little bit whether 19 focus brands is maybe toomany, and could you possibly better leverage your investments if you narrowed your focus a little bit? Is that under considerationat all?"

Fundamentally, the answer to your question is no, there are not too many, but yes, we agree that in terms of investment, that probablynarrowing the focus and making bigger bets against a smaller number of brands is probably strategically the way to go. On the other hand, a lot of the brands are very profitable and need to be looked after appropriately. Fundamentally, we agreestrategically with what you just suggested."

Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Well when you look at this -- first of all, we don't have a subset of focused focus brands -- you made that up, not us. But going alongwith that concept, okay, you kind of start with what is the biggest piece of the portfolio, and that's the Mondavi franchise. RobertMondavi and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi.That, in and of itself, is a large part of -- or the most important part of the focus brandportfolio. Then you've got a few -- I'm not just talking wine here -- you've got a few other important brands, like SVEDKA vodka, like KimCrawford. Those would be examples of brands that really rise to the top in terms of their level of importance -- Clos Du Bois -- In theoverall focus brand portfolio."

Is that a contribution to depletions?"

As you think about, you remarked that you think you can grow in line with the wine category still, in spite of some ofthese value challenges this year.

There might still be some flux between promo spend andmarketing, but they kind of zero off at times, gets to the bottom line. All you'll be left with is pretty much pricing -- normal stuff,pricing and mix. Now, we do have the contractual cost of goods sold increase. Okay, so just normal stuff, but I think the increased marketing and promotion spending will be behind us, and it will be [an]apples-to-apples year if you look at fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 from a marketing and spending perspective at Crown."

And if I could build a little on the earlier question about operating income and wine growing faster than revenue. From whereI sit, it's hard to see why you have that view. Is that a function of your mix view? Is it simply leveraging of the fixed costs? Can youtalk a little bit more about that, Rob?"
76,18590746,CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC.,01/05/2012,3:30PM,STZ,"Q3 2012 Constellation Brands, Inc. Earnings Conference Call",Rob Sands,Constellation Brands Inc,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Yes. I think, Mark, most of it will come from we have some pretty robust plans in place to reduce costs of goods sold, and we've talkedabout these a number of times, around things like reduced number of bottling lines, a higher fixed-cost leverage, some blendchanges, some better warehouse management, some better grape buying, things around that. I think that we will keep SG&A growingbelow net sales, okay? I think those two areas, and COGS is the big number, will be -- will help us leverage the P&L. The wild card, I think will be promotion spending. Okay, because as you know, it's a pretty fractious industry. We're not the onlyplayer. We kind of can't raise prices when nobody else is, which as you know, Rob mentioned some of that earlier. I think the thingswithin our control we feel pretty good about.     I think that things that are a little less within our control, like pricing and promotions, well they're not within our control. That beingsaid, we've had two years in a row of short harvests, so you would hope that the industry would reduce promotion spend and maybeincrease prices, but time will tell."

We started the year withlower cash flow guidance than we're ending the year with.

So 60%.Then of the remaining 40%, there's probably about another 8%, for argument's sake, that in theorycould be more consolidated in the manner that we consolidated the initial 60%. The reason that there's only 8% of the remaining 40% is because you have to remember that some of the markets are control-statemarkets like Pennsylvania, where there's really -- where the whole concept of consolidating distributors is inapplicable. And then another large percentage are what are called franchise-law states which means that we don't have the ability to necessarilyterminate the existing distributors pursuant to a consolidation plan, so it's difficult to change your distribution network in thosefranchise markets, so 8%."

It's not so much sole distributor and multiple distributor, although that's a part of it. But what really -- yes, the answer is yes. Wedefinitely are out-performing in markets where we've implemented our distributor consolidation efforts but that -- what are someof the things that really drive that, where we're able to consolidate, we're able to have exclusive sales forces within those distributorsselling only our products.
