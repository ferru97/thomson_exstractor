1,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,False,True,False,"Thank you. Good morning everyone. Happy New Year. We last spoke on December 19 when we announced the Group's interim results and sincethen we've seen a better overall picture for the December period. HMV Retail like-for-like sales showed an improvement in their trajectory, down8.2% for the five weeks to December 31 compared with the previously reported seven weeks to December 17 when HMV retail like-for-like saleswere down 13.2%. The numbers have been particularly affected by a very weak games market. As you may have seen reported, the games market was down 16%over the festive period. We achieved strong market share in our core categories of music and film, in part due to our highly competitive pricing. On DVD and Blu-Ray, ourChristmas best sellers included the Inbetweeners movie, which sold well over 1m copies across the market in its first seven days and became ourbiggest ever week one DVD release. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 and Hangover Part 2 also performed strongly. And we experiencedimpressive sales of comedy DVDs from the likes of Peter Kay, Lee Evans and Sarah Millican, who became the fastest ever selling female stand-upartiste. Frozen Planet led the way in TV-related product. In music HMV did particularly well with Michael Buble's chart-topping Christmas album, while our press and PR activities helped to play a key partin getting the Military Wives' Choir single to be the Christmas number one. We also saw strong numbers in sales of our personal technology products over the Christmas period. In the 144 stores refitted with an extendedrange of portable digital products, technology like-for-like sales rose 51% in the five weeks to December 31, an improvement in the previouslyreported average of 42% since the respective store refit dates.We've sold 500,000 pairs of headphones in December -- that's one every two seconds-- and 20,000 tablet computers. The strategic review of HMV Live announced at the interims is continuing to make good progress. Of course we anticipate that trading conditions and the consumer environment will continue to be challenging, but we remain confident in theHMV brand and in the future prospects of our business. And, with that, over to your questions."

6,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"Well, look, I think we feel confident because, firstly, the measures we're taking to start to turn the business around are starting to bear fruit. So the,in particular obviously, the technology initiative, and in particular, and it's very early days, some of the things we're doing to drive online and digital.We have a very supportive supplier base. We have a supportive banking base. And therefore although we've repeated, as we have to, what we saidbefore Christmas, we still feel confident in the future of the business and the fact that it's going to be around for some time to come.We're headingin the right direction and we have a supportive group of stakeholders."
7,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,James Davey,Thomson Reuters,Media,True,False,False,"Okay. Just on the progress you're making on technology, in those 144 stores can you give a like, an overall like-for-like figure to see how, get asense of how those stores compare to the rest of the estate?"
8,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,Overall those stores will be tracking 4% better than the Group that haven't had the refit.
9,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,James Davey,Thomson Reuters,Media,True,False,False,"Right, okay. And the difference between the 13.2% you reported in December for the first seven weeks and then the 8.2% you reported now, thatdifference, would you -- you did say that there would be an improvement. The improvement that you achieved, was that in line with what youexpected? Or obviously you were hoping for more, but did -- was that basically what you thought would happen?"
10,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"Yes, it's broadly in line with what we were expecting. Clearly these are still disappointing results, but they're broadly in line with our expectations."
11,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,James Davey,Thomson Reuters,Media,True,False,False,"Okay. And in terms of the full year consensus, what was your understanding of what that was going into today? Was it about breakeven and areyou anticipating any changes?"
12,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"No, we're not anticipating any changes. It was about breakeven when we last reported on the 17th -- sorry, on the 19th. We didn't see any changesthen and we don't expect to see any changes as a result of today's figures."
13,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,James Davey,Thomson Reuters,Media,True,False,False,"Okay. So two years of breakeven, do you need to see an improvement in the like-for-like?"
14,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,That's a very specific question. I think that we wouldn't expect to see much variation from the numbers that you've been seeing as we run into thefinal few months.
15,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,James Davey,Thomson Reuters,Media,True,False,False,Okay. Thank you very much.
16,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,Thank you.
17,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Operator,NA,NA,True,False,False,Your next question comes from Katie Linsell from Bloomberg. Please go ahead.
18,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Katie Linsell,Bloomberg,Media,True,False,False,"Morning, Simon."
19,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,Morning.
20,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Katie Linsell,Bloomberg,Media,True,False,False,"I wanted to ask a few more questions about the HMV Live strategic review. You've been saying how you're seeing good progress, but I wonderwhether it's possible to tell us any more about whether a sale is likely and whether you might have a deadline on that sale. I know before we'vetalked about your debt having a factor on that."
21,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"Yes. No, I can't give you any more detail at this stage other than to say that we kicked the process off a couple of weeks ago. It will take some weeks.And when there is more to say we will certainly let you know. But there is no specific deadline that we're working to. Specifically your question about the debt, what we said last time in terms of why a sale might be the outcome of the review is that we do have atranche of debt, called tranche B, which attracts an interest rate that rises over a period of time, ratcheting up in particular in January 2013. Andclearly one of the options we have is to pay that debt down before the interest rate becomes onerous."
22,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Katie Linsell,Bloomberg,Media,True,False,False,"Okay, thank you. And also previously on the last call you talked about the opening on December 24 and that Saturday could help your Christmassales. Can you give us any kind of figure as to what sales were made that day or how that day might have helped your sales figures?"
23,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"Yes. What I talked about obviously with Christmas falling on a Sunday was that the run-up to Christmas for us and every other retailer was quitedifferent this year. What we found, and I suspect most other retailers found, that was that in fact the Thursday and Friday before Christmas turnedout to be the busiest days, and that Christmas Eve itself, the 24th, whilst an important day, actually I think most people had done their shoppingby then. So in the end it was the Thursday and Friday that were the peak of Christmas."
24,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Katie Linsell,Bloomberg,Media,True,False,False,"Okay, brilliant. And is it possible to give any kind of percentage as to what your -- what December represented in terms of annual sales?"
25,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"December is about 20%, a little more than 20% of annual sales."
26,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Katie Linsell,Bloomberg,Media,True,False,False,Okay. Is that in the average year for you or --
27,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"Yes. Yes, it's always about that."
28,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Katie Linsell,Bloomberg,Media,True,False,False,Okay. And do you think it will represent the same for this year as previous years?
29,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,Yes.
30,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Katie Linsell,Bloomberg,Media,True,False,False,"Okay, brilliant. And a lot of focus is going into this switch to technology products, the MP3 players and headphones. It was interesting to hear afew figures about those that were sold. How did they compare with sales of CDs and DVDs?"
31,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"Technology is now representing about 12% of our sales so it's still a small category in relation to our other categories. So CD is about a quarter andDVD is about 45%, and the balance is games. It's clearly growing fast and over the next few years we have said that we expect technology to growto up to about 30% of our sales mix."
32,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Katie Linsell,Bloomberg,Media,True,False,False,Okay.

34,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Katie Linsell,Bloomberg,Media,True,False,False,Okay. Okay.
35,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"I'm sorry, I've just been tapping my calculator and I think December is nearer 25% than 20%. And that again, same this year as previous years."
36,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Katie Linsell,Bloomberg,Media,True,False,False,Okay. Thanks for your time.

39,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Zoe Wood,The Guardian,Media,True,False,False,"Hi, Simon."
40,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"Hello, Zoe."
41,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Zoe Wood,The Guardian,Media,True,False,False,"Hi, just returning to your overall view of Christmas, I think going into the period you said fingers crossed. These are in line. Did it pan out betterthan you expected or was in line with your worst expectations?"
42,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,I think neither. It was broadly in line with our expectations. You always hope that your expectations will be exceeded. In the end the trading wasbroadly on the trajectory we expected it to be on.
43,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Zoe Wood,The Guardian,Media,True,False,False,Okay. So that at least is encouraging given that it's -- we're seeing an acceleration.
44,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"Yes, indeed."

And you mentioned in last month's results about the need to speak to suppliers and negotiate a material improvement in conditions. Arethose negotiations continuing or did you get what you asked for?
46,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"I don't think you'd expect me to go into the details of commercially sensitive discussions with our suppliers. So as I said earlier, we have supportivesuppliers. They've been supportive right through last year. They continue to be supportive. And so we're important to them and they're veryimportant to us."
47,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Zoe Wood,The Guardian,Media,True,False,False,"Okay. And then just finally a bit more, a bit about the consumer mood. Do you think that people were being more frugal this year or what was thetransaction value like?"
48,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"Our transaction value was a little bit down year on year so I do think people were very cautious and price-sensitive. Our own prices were highlycompetitive, which certainly helped us, particularly on our DVD offer. But no doubt we're going to continue to see a very price-sensitive and carefulcustomer."
49,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Zoe Wood,The Guardian,Media,True,False,False,And did you see sales immediately tail off post-Christmas? Other retailers are suggesting that people used up their money in the run-up to Christmasand there was nothing left for the sale.
50,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,"We are a very pre-Christmas retailer so by far our biggest week is the week in the run-up to Christmas and that's probably four times the size of theweek after Christmas. So unlike, for example, big ticket retailers, electricals and furniture, who would seek bigger sales post-Christmas, we are agift, a gifting retailer."
51,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Zoe Wood,The Guardian,Media,True,False,False,"Okay, thank you."

54,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,James Davey,Thomson Reuters,Media,True,False,False,"Yes, hi. Some of the analysts seem to be suggesting they may have to look at other asset sales in addition to HMV Live. Is it possible that your stakein 7digital could come on the block as well?"
55,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,Simon Fox,HMV Group plc,CEO,True,False,False,I think we've said that it's something that we could look at. But I can certainly tell you at the moment there is no process ongoing in relation tothat. But it is a valuable asset. But there's no process at the moment in respect of it.
56,18607954,HMV GROUP,01/09/2012,8:00AM,HMV.L,HMV Group PLC Christmas Trading Update Conference Call,James Davey,Thomson Reuters,Media,True,False,False,"Okay. Okay, thank you."
