1,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Amit Bhalla,Citi,Analyst,False,True,False,"Good morning. Two quick questions for you. First, last quarter, when you were talking about the infection prevention business, youtalked about the impact of procedure volumes and distributor purchasing being slightly weaker. Can you comment on that inparticular? And then just secondly, can you quantify the level of pricing pressure that you are seeing? Thanks."
2,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,False,True,False,"It's Jim Hinrichs, and Kieran can chime in here if he'd like. We are not seeing increased pressure in procedure volumes. I wouldn't saythat things are rebounding dramatically, but we are not pointing at that as a major driver here. And when it comes to -- the second part of your question was about pricing pressure -- about pricing pressure, we do continue tosee pricing pressure in specific businesses, and those are the ones that are less clinically differentiated. So when I look at our productlines in respiratory disposables and legacy prep, as well as our legacy non-dedicated infusion sets, those are the areas where we areseeing pricing pressure. I think it ranges from a few points into the mid single digits of pricing push back to us from our customers."
3,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"Just a chip shot on that, Amit. It's not as if we're seeing a rebound on a procedure volumes side. It's just that we wouldn't point tothat as the primary driver. We are seeing it across both of our conversion-oriented businesses. What we are seeing is that we're notlosing market share. We still feel very good from a competitive perspective, and that's the feedback that we are getting from theorthogonal checkpoints in the field. What it does seem is that in the environment that we are at, some of the conversion efforts are just taking a bit longer than theyhave in the past. And what you do is when you are sitting across from these hospital administrators, they see the value. Sometimeswhat you will do is you'll get a conversion of 50% of the hospital or the hospital systems, and that second part of the conversion isusually a lot of street fighting, where you are in there, you are looking for different levels of the organization to support you in thatconversion. Right now, they are a bit distracted, and we are not seeing that same level of support simply because they've got multiple priorities.But the good news, we are not losing market share there. We are still growing above market rates, and we are steady as she goes. Also, this adjustment in the sales force is going to allow us to have greater resources being focused in front of the customers asopposed to in front of the windshield. So we are taking the actions to become more efficient and more effective with our customersas well."
4,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Amit Bhalla,Citi,Analyst,False,True,False,"Kieran, you mentioned distributors as an issue last quarter. Was that resolved or are distributors --?"
5,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,False,True,False,"It's Jim. That very specific -- obviously, inventory changes throughout the channel all the time in all the product lines. The specificissue we pointed to last quarter did not repeat in this quarter, so that seems to have leveled itself out. That was specifically, if youremember, destocking in the infection prevention businesses, which seems to have leveled off now. So we are kind of -- we feel likewe are back to normal in that part of the business from that perspective."
6,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Amit Bhalla,Citi,Analyst,False,True,False,Okay. Thank you.

8,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Matt Taylor,Barclays Capital,Analyst,False,True,False,"A couple of quick ones. One, I just wanted to understand within Procedural Solutions, I know you talked about pressure on productsthat were not clinically differentiated. But was there any one or two areas in particular with the surgical tools or some of the disposableswhere the pressure was kind of outside?"
9,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"Well, Jim and I will sort of tag team a little bit on this. Certain areas such as the respiratory disposables, where there is very littleclinical differentiation -- I mean, some segments, there's a lot, but there is other niches within that where there's not as muchdifferentiation. That is subject much more to the pricing pressures we have seen. We haven't really on the surgical tools side seen dramatic pricing pressure at all. In fact, we feel like we're doing -- we are not doinggangbusters there, but we feel like from a competitive perspective as we looked around, we actually feel like we are doing betterthan competitors and feel like we're gaining some share. So it is in some very targeted areas, some on the valve business. The newer stuff, like the Medegens and whatnot, very clinicallydifferentiated. Some of the existing product lines that have been in the market for a longer time, they're going to be a little bit moresubject to those pressures."
10,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,False,True,False,"That's exactly right. Again, the three product lines we have mentioned that have pricing pressure -- respiratory disposables, legacyprep, legacy non-dedicated -- all those products that are just not as clinically differentiated therefore tougher to command a pricepremium."
11,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Matt Taylor,Barclays Capital,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay. And you lowered the low end of the EPS guidance, but I think you mentioned at the beginning of your comments that yousaw really no change to your longer-term margin improvement goals. And I was just curious with this increased pressure how youare going to be able to absorb or offset that and still achieve those goals."
12,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"Look, we've got a lot of things going on around the Company there's a lot of shots on goal when it comes to building efficienciesto reducing complexities to be helping us become more efficient in front of those customers. When you are going through these changes, sometimes it can get a little bit bumpy on a quarterly basis. And I think we have beenpretty open about that from the beginning. So when you have a little bit of changes in the mix like we have seen this time, we arefeeling pretty good about year-end on the top line overall. It's just about sort of the mix of getting there. And so we think that the focus that we have on simplifying the business, on continuing to gain efficiencies, on some of theimprovements we are making in the sales force, particularly in the Procedural Solutions side, to be able to help those reps be ableto spend more time in front of the customers, we think they are going to pay dividends, and we are steady as she goes on thosethings. We don't want to pull back on the investment on those."
13,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,False,True,False,Exactly.
14,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Matt Taylor,Barclays Capital,Analyst,False,True,False,"All right, thanks a lot, guys."
15,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Operator,NA,NA,False,True,False,"Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan."
16,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Mike Weinstein,JPMorgan,Analyst,False,True,False,"Help me out here. I just wanted to understand a couple items. So If I look at the details you gave out in the release, your revenuesactually are pretty close to where we were at, but there's a much bigger drop-off on the EBIT line. And then when you guide to EPS,it's actually relatively close. So can you just explain that sequence there? So revenues don't appear like they are that different than we were forecasting, butthere's a much larger drop on the EBIT line. And then EPS, it seems like you seem to make up some of the gap. So is the expectationfor the quarter and then for the year that you'll make up some of the -- some of an EBIT shortfall below that line with a lower taxrate?"
17,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,False,True,False,"Yes, a couple -- that's a great question, Mike, and this is probably worth taking a minute to go through. A couple of things going on. The first is revenue came in a little bit light. We were facing an EBIT number for the quarter, based on preliminary results, that wasdifferent enough from our expectations that we thought it worthwhile saying it now, so when we are out in front of 50% or 60% ofour shareholders today we could have meaningful conversations. And so that was sort of the reason for the preannouncement. Revenue, as you mentioned, coming in just slightly below what the Street was expecting, also below what our expectations were.But two things are really going on. One is there is a revenue shortfall, and the revenue shortfall is largely in our higher-marginproducts. So that's driving a larger -- or a disproportionately large EBIT miss. The second thing going on is these less differentiated products, with the pricing pressure we have seen in this quarter, is also drivinga margin push -- driving margin pressure. So you end up with what I would describe as a disproportionate gross margin and EBITimpact on our bottom line for the quarter. And that was really the reason for the release. Now, we do have some below-the-line upside in interest and other, and we believe in the tax rate, although the tax rate won't befinalized until the end of this week, that will offset some of the difference, and that will carry through to the year. So when you takewhat we have said today and translate it for the year, the way you need to look at it is to say, look, revenue probably still within therange we provided, but we are losing some revenue growth in the higher-margin products. We've got gross margin pressure creating sort of what I would describe as a dime of EBIT pressure out of Procedural Solutions thatwe will make up below the line, primarily on the tax rate, which is why we only took that tax rate -- the EPS number, the bottom ofthe range, down by a nickel until we can get our tax forecast done, and then we will retighten up the range back to a dime. That'sthe goal. So did that make sense?"
18,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"Sounds like (inaudible). But let me just make one final comment on that, which is maybe a bit more qualitative. When you walkthrough this, I think it's not unlikely that maybe 90% of the companies would not have pre-released an earnings today with regardsto this. We feel that the environment is out there -- clearly, there's a lot going on in the world economy and the stock markets, etcetera. We have committed that we would be as transparent as we can with everybody. And even in situations where we think wecan claw back quite a bit through things like our very aggressive and worthwhile tax management strategies, our view is that if wegot there different, we wanted to be able to talk openly and give you as much visibility as we can. So that's the intention of doingthis."

20,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,David Roman,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,False,True,False,"I had two quick questions. One is -- am I correct that FX -neutral revenue growth for the first half of the year is running between 2%and 2.5%? And if that is correct, can you maybe bridge these current levels to the 3% to 5% you are guiding to for the full year?"
21,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,False,True,False,"David, it's Jim. I don't have those constant currency revenue growth yet. But I think the first quarter was around 2%, and then thisquarter, don't have that adjusted out yet completely. But that's probably about right.We are expecting a pickup, obviously, in revenuein the back half of the year. We'll give all of that detail as to where we expect that to take place in the earnings release."
22,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,David Roman,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay. And then secondly, and maybe more broadly, if you look at the long-term operating margin targets that you have put outthere and we look at this quarter, can you maybe just remind us to what extent top-line performance and EBIT margin performanceare connected and what flexibility you have to continue to expand EBIT margins should in fact the top line remain under pressure?"
23,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,False,True,False,"Yes, sure. Certainly the two things are connected. We believe we have different plans and different contingencies that continue toallow us to drive margins, even in a lower growth environment. Certainly top line helps -- as we have been very consistent in sayingall along, top-line growth certainly helps our leverage story, but we are not dependent on it. What we saw this quarter was mix working against us a little bit, and we saw pricing pressure working against us a little bit. But weare now -- just as Kieran mentioned earlier, we're doing some things that are making changes that we think will reignite the mixback in our favor in terms of putting our sales forces together and making them more productive and filling their bags more andincreasing their overall capacity. So I think there continue to be opportunities to get mix working back in our favor. We are still very committed to that long-termgrowth, the long-term margin target. It does require top-line growth, but we have scenarios planned out under low growth and sortof medium or higher growth that can still get us there, which is why we are still absolutely committed to those targets. It just requiresa slightly different way of getting there."
24,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"Just to add on a little bit. As you might expect, when we look at our investment philosophy within the business, we are certainlytargeting those areas that we think, A, have the most opportunity for expansion and growth, and B, would have a disproportionateimpact on the profitability. So you would expect that of us and that's certainly what we are doing. This movement to the two-segment structure, it was really critical in that process. Because by separating out the Medical Systemsbusinesses and the Procedural Solutions, you invest differently in each of those businesses and you need to manage them different.And they were subsumed in these more complicated business units before that didn't allow for true execution on a differentiatedinvestment strategy. So the benefits of that are going to be yielded over time, but the structural changes are the things that were absolutely required forus to gain the visibility and be able to differentially invest in those businesses."
25,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,David Roman,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you very much."
26,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Operator,NA,NA,False,True,False,"David Lewis, Morgan Stanley."
27,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,David Lewis,Morgan Stanley,Analyst,False,True,False,"Good morning. Jim, I know you don't have the specifics on sort of where the leverage, both gross margin and EBIT, kind of landedfor the quarter. But I wonder, given that gross margin pressures would seem obvious, whether they are pricing or mix, last quarterwe didn't see the type of SG&A leverage I think some investors were hoping for. Is it possible to share with us whether despite thatgross margin pressure whether you think there was evidence that you drove SG&A leverage in this particular quarter as youanniversaried some of that front-end spend last quarter?"
28,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,False,True,False,"Certainly, my expectation is and preliminary results would indicate that our SG&A as a percent of sales was considerably lower inthe second quarter than in the first quarter. Again, numbers aren't final, but that is my expectation. That was my expectation, andthe preliminary results indicate that that is the case. Year over year, given some of the gross margin pressure that we've seen and given some of the revenue pressures that we had, Ithink it's probably going to be -- SG&A as a percent of sales will likely be in line with what we saw last year -- I don't think either astrong move one way or the other. Again, very preliminary results, so you're not going to see a reduction, but you're also not goingto see an increase. So we continue to look at that line that's one of the things we're taking a look at over the course of the next 30days, to figure out what we can do there to continue the trend that we want to see."
29,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"But it's also important to note that in that SG&A is where some of our investments for simplification and investment for growth are.A good example of that would be some of the outside resources that we've pulled in in order to help us work through theproject-planning process to make sure that as we attack the complexity and we attack the cost structure, that we do it in a way thatorients us towards growth and towards execution capability, as opposed to sort of meandering your way through it. So there is someinvestment in that as well that I think is important for us to know."
30,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,False,True,False,"The other thing we look for on that line, too -- just to continue on that theme -- the other thing we look for on that line, and we willbe getting that over the next couple of weeks, is where were we spending, and was it in the front office versus the back office? Lastquarter, we were quite successful in getting spend moved from administrative functions into customer-facing and revenue-generatingand R&D and innovation type spend. And I'm assuming and hoping that we will see that continued trend in the second quarter."
31,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,David Lewis,Morgan Stanley,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay. And Kieran, one quick question on ChloraPrep. What we've seen with this business is some periods of acceleration anddeceleration. Most specifically coming off the New England Journal of Medicine article, we saw an acceleration in this business anda renewed sales effort. Is what we are seeing now sort of a relative level of maturation in the ChloraPrep product line, or do you thinkthis is just really more of kind of a breathing quarter for the product, if you will?"
32,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"It's a good question, and it's one that we are obviously trying to dig in and understand at a very deep level. I think what would giveme confidence to say that we still have a lot of headroom in that business is that we saw very similar dynamics with the Medegenbusiness as we did with the ChloraPrep business. And both those businesses have the same core drivers, which is their conversionbusinesses. And when you tend to convert, you convert large parts of hospital systems and then have to street fight to get it all theway across and change behavior. So the fact that they had similar dynamics would lead us to believe that -- and obviously, as I said it was orthogonally checked you'reout in the field and you're asking questions -- that that was the primary driver. Now obviously, whenever you get -- the more penetrated you get, it does get harder, and so there's no question about that. Andthe percentage change is always a change over time, right, the law of big numbers. But again, I think just from what we thinkhappened this quarter, I think it was much more about converting practices across the businesses as opposed to any specific lineitem."
33,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Mazzola,CareFusion Corporation,"SVP of Global Marketing, Communication & Investor Relations",False,True,False,"Okay, thank you very much."
34,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Operator,NA,NA,False,True,False,"Lennox Ketner, Bank of America Merrill Lynch."
35,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Lennox Ketner,BofA Merrill Lynch,Analyst,False,True,False,"Thanks. Just to follow up on the ChloraPrep line, I am just wondering -- you're saying it has become more difficult to convert accounts.I'm just wondering if you're assuming that that changes going forward. In other words, is 5% growth kind of the new normal or areyou assuming in your guidance that improves?"
36,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Kieran Gallahue,CareFusion Corporation,"Chairman, CEO",False,True,False,"Again, good question, and I think it's too early to say near-term what we think those figures will be. And we will certainly, I think, inFebruary at the release time be able to give a little bit more detail on that. I think the conservative way that we are looking at it is to say near-term, there's probably still going to be some reticence on the partof the hospitals to convert their practices at the same rate that they were converting, say, a year or two ago. That being said, thatdoesn't mean it's going to stay that way and it's not going to change back. And from our perspective, part of what we are doing to help that along is to recognize that we have the ability to put more effectiveresources in front of the customers. And so this adjustment I've referred to a couple of times in the sales force that we did duringthe second quarter was really taking reps that had different products, but they had the same call points, the same customers, thesame territories overall. And by combining their bags and helping them manage the way that they message in front of the customer,it makes their interactions with the customers more holistic. They are able to sell the full portfolio of products that are oriented inour infection prevention area on one side. And on the other side, it says that they don't have to spend most of the life travelingaround their territory, but they can actually use it in a more practical way.     So there's lots of things that influence. There is the behavior of the customers themselves, and then there is how we help manageit. Because our job is not to accept market growth it's to drive market growth. And we will continue to focus on that."
37,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Lennox Ketner,BofA Merrill Lynch,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay, and then one more just big-picture question. I think Jim talked about you guys grew about 2% on an organic constant-currencybasis for the first of the year, which is actually 3% just on a constant-currency basis, so within your guidance range. But comps get tougher in the back half of the year, so I'm just wondering kind of what -- how investors can get comfort that youguys can keep top-line growth within that range even in spite of difficult comps. Are there certain areas where you expect to seegrowth accelerate? Or maybe if you can just speak a little bit to the back half of the year."
38,18608925,CAREFUSION CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,CFN,CareFusion Conference Call to Discuss Preliminary Second Quarter Results,Jim Hinrichs,CareFusion Corporation,CFO,False,True,False,"And again, we will give a much more complete update -- and I wouldn't want to be -- like I said, there's constant currency growthrates. All of that will be out in the second quarter. So until we get -- I don't want to get pinned down to any specific numbers in thefirst half or second quarter until we have all the results in front of us. Kieran can chime in on this as well.We have set in place at the beginning of the year and continue to see faster growth in the secondhalf of the year than we will see in the first half of the year. There are a number of businesses where we would expect to see that.Certainly that we initially expected that the Procedural Solutions business would grow faster in the second half of the year than thefirst half. I think we still believe that to be the case absolutely it's just not going to be as much as what we had originally planned. In addition, some of the businesses in Medical Systems are getting traction. In particular, I'd point to respiratory technologies andventilation, where, if you remember, we started off the year a little bit down in the first quarter. And I think we're going to seecontinued improvement in that business through the year. That will drive some growth in the second half of the year. And some ofthe other businesses in the Medical Systems, infusion as well, might continue to accelerate growth in the back half of the year. So there will be faster growth in the second half -- or we believe there will be faster growth in the second half of the year versus thefirst half of the year. And again, as I said, once we get everything buttoned down, we will make sure we give you the detail on wherewe think that's going to come from on February 2."

So we will be making that revision -- as I mentioned earlier, we are looking at a revisiondownward in EBIT, primarily in the Procedural Solutions business. And then we believe there's some upside below the line that wewill also be taking into account. So when we narrow that range, it will be somewhere between the $1.75 to $1.90, that's correct."

And then just on the Medical Systems sales, you had mentioned dispensing, infusion and ventilation were all strong. Couldyou just maybe give us a little bit more color there? It sounds like you're not seeing any changes with like hospital CapEx or anythingin that regard. I was a little bit surprised by ventilation also being up."

We will certainly go until more details as we get to the release. But I will say that,yes, the business segment overall is performing very well. I think we are very fortunate that the medical systems that we sell are essential to the efficient operations of hospitals. And we areseeing a lot of interest from customers as they look to try to get better scale on their human capital, particularly in the nursing area,where they are trying to get better control over their supply chain and particularly in pharmacy. And we help in each of those areas.So we are quite fortunate. And yes, I can appreciate the question on ventilation, but the ventilation business has been performingwell. So that was across the segment."
