Firstly on inflation, could you just give us a clue as to how that moved in the period whether that camedown a little bit? And secondly, not necessarily just for Morrison but for the sector, for the industry as a whole, what would a realistic level of like-for-likegrowth be to expect for 2012 do you think?"
2,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Richard Pennycook,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CFO,False,True,False,"Good morning. It's Richard. I'll take those. We don't, as you know, break out inflation specifically, but we've talked about the fact thatin the run-in to Christmas, it was still pretty stubborn. It was around -- what we saw though was a very promotional Christmas withsome record weeks in terms of promotional participation helping just to take the edge off those inflationary pressures for thecustomer. As far as 2012 is concerned, a bit like the conversation we had this time last year. We're expecting overall market growth levels tobe pretty subdued, and that's how we're planning our business."

And, obviously, non-food was very deflationary over the Christmas period."

We're well on track with the program. It's GBP1 billion over the two years. And in terms of the momentum on theprogram, we're back in the market again today with that. We remain very comfortable to get that done over the two years to March'13."
10,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Jaime Vazquez,Santander,Analyst,False,True,False,"I thought that in the third quarter trading statement call, you not only commented to GBP1 billion in two years, but to [have GBP1billion] by March. Should we forget about the second part of the commitment?"
11,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Richard Pennycook,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CFO,False,True,False,"No, we'll keep the momentum going. But precisely where we land at March obviously we'll tell you on the day.Volumes in the markethave been very low in our share shares. We can only go at a sensible pace to run the program, but we're committed to getting itdone."
12,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Jaime Vazquez,Santander,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay. And finally, there's an article in the FT today suggesting that you're interested in 11 Best Buy sites in retail parks. Can you makea comment, or at least say whether you are looking at it?"
13,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,False,True,False,"I'm afraid we can't comment specifically on that speculation.What we can do, Jaime, which we said actually before Christmas, is thatwe're ambitious for Kiddicare. We can see real growth in that business. We like it very much. And if there's an opportunity out thereto accelerate that growth, we will take it. But I can't comment on specific situations."
14,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Jaime Vazquez,Santander,Analyst,False,True,False,"So in principle, you are not against the idea of expanding non-food in stores, in specialized stores."
15,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,False,True,False,"I think I've been quite vocal on this issue that we just don't see non-food being sold in bricks and mortar, certainly not in food stores.I think Kiddicare is a very different proposition, and we've got a large store down in Peterborough. It's one of the largest kids' storesin all of Europe. It's quite a tactile purchase. It's an emotional purchase. [You need to think about it because this is expensive. So Kiddicare is a great example of multi-channel. People go to the store, think about it, go home, buy it online. And so it's a propositionthink IKEA, think Apple that lends itself well to having a very small number of physical outlets, but I can't comment on the Best Buy,obviously. But Scott Weavers-Wright was quite vocal about it before Christmas saying this is a business that can grow. And we'revery ambitious for it. We've spent [GBP70 million] on it, and we're going to grow this thing."
16,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Jaime Vazquez,Santander,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay, that's very clear. Thanks very much."

Could you give us some color to your description of sharp prices within the industry, and how you see the pricingenvironment year on year going into 2012, or in 2012? And could you also confirm whether you had positive or negative like-for-like volumes in the six-week period, please?"
19,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,False,True,False,"Okay, Clive. We are very comfortable with our value proposition, and we have had very sharp pricing all year. You'll remember westarted with Fuel Britannia about this time last year, and then into Price Crunch, so we've always had sharp pricing. It's a market thathas a lot of sharp pricing in it, none more so than Christmas which was extremely competitive, and we see that competitive cut andthrust continuing into this year that's coming. So no change there, and that's why if you're not on the right price you're not going to do well. And it's also how we've seen customersshop. And I'll give you a good example people trading our champagne into sparkling wine. That's an example of people tradinginto joints of protein, like pork, for example, out of more expensive protein. So that sort of thing. And in terms of volume, you know we don't break it out, but you've had low like for likes. And the market in general has had negativevolumes, so you can draw your own conclusions."
20,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Clive Black,Shore Capital,Analyst,False,True,False,"And just in terms of that trading environment, pricing environment, would you say that the Tesco Big Price Drop initiative wherethey're seeking to seemingly lower promotional activity for price, and Asda's pricing activity has particularly led to any switching, orshare loss for you? It looks like Asda has had a very strong festive trading period."
21,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,False,True,False,"Well, you've got to play tunes at Christmas, Clive, and our job, Richard and I and the rest of the team here, our job is to chart a coursewhich is smart sales. And that's what we've been focused on this Christmas. We've had a solid performance. If you look at our likefor like on transactions, customer count is up nearly 5%, 4.8%. So obviously, we were watching what was going on with our competitors, but we are maintaining our full-year guidance. We've hada cracking year. We've been growing strongly all year, and we had to trade through Christmas and anticipate what was coming atus, and deal with that."

We really would rather do that at the prelims in March. This is just a sales update, so forgive us. That said, the plansthat we've talked about before are very much on track, but we'll give the detail for that in March."
26,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Niamh McSherry,Berenberg Bank,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay, thanks."

So for us as we look at the business, we've got growth everywhere. It's a little bit stronger in the south, but not an order ofmagnitude different."
30,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Sam Hart,Charles Stanley,Analyst,False,True,False,"Is there any particular reason why you think trading is holding up in the north? A lot of the anecdotal evidence seems to suggestthat the north is being -- well, suffering more in the current economic environment."

It's clearly very important in areas of country that are particularlychallenged in terms of the household budget, and that's where through 2011 I think we've shown real success in having that verystrong focus on value."

34,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Matthew Truman,JPMorgan,Analyst,False,True,False,"Just two from me. Firstly, can you just give us a rough idea of the entry rate versus the exit rate for the like for like? And secondly, as fuel is now coming off, are you seeing the spend return to in-store? Clearly, one of the arguments last year was thatfuel was so high that the like for like in total was good and you would hope to see that return in store. But looking at the industryslowdown, it doesn't appear that that's the case. Can you just give us an idea of the kind of trend you're seeing in terms of thecustomer? Are they just stopping the buying process in total in store and not replicating that exchange back as you maybe havehoped? More of an industry question."
35,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Richard Pennycook,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CFO,False,True,False,"Matt, let me take the entry/exit point. Forgive me, but I'm not going to get into that level of detail. This trading update is the sixweeks of Christmas, which is a relatively short time span anyway. But the other point I'd make, which you're well aware of, is thetrading patterns change greatly because of Christmas falling on the Sunday and we're, all of us, up against some weather effectsfrom the previous year. So when you look at those individual trading patterns around the period, it really is very difficult to unpickand I'd suggest that there's limited upside in trying to do that."
36,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,False,True,False,"And on the fuel, Matt, we would expect some of that to start coming back in. As you know, fuel is literally a fixed cost, and with pricesstarting to drop, we'd like to see some of that coming through. Not seeing that at the moment. I think people are up to their eyesnow with carrying debts over from Christmas, so I don't think you're going to see much of that until February, if you do see it at all."
37,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Matthew Truman,JPMorgan,Analyst,False,True,False,Okay. That's great. Thank you.

39,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Alastair Johnston,Citi,Analyst,False,True,False,"Sorry, I was very late on this call, so you may have already answered this, but just a very quick question. Can you just specify if therewere any specific calendar effects and whether they're positive or negative during the period? You mentioned in reply to Matt's question regarding Christmas falling on the Sunday. If you could just talk through the calendareffects, that would be very helpful."
40,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,False,True,False,"Al, you certainly didn't miss that point. We just addressed it briefly in the context of Matt's question as well. Christmas came verylate because of that big shopping opportunity on the Saturday before Christmas, so I suspect that will be a theme of comments thatyou hear over the next week or two. But in a way, you'd expect that because of that Saturday shopping opportunity that people had."
41,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Alastair Johnston,Citi,Analyst,False,True,False,But it doesn't change the overall level of sales year on year for the Christmas period. It just shifts it around within the Christmasperiod. Is that correct or --?
42,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Richard Pennycook,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CFO,False,True,False,Correct.
43,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Dalton Philips,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CEO,False,True,False,"Yes, that's the expectation. We obviously, all of us, wait to see market stats. We had some out on Friday from Nielsen, but the factthat they were just up to the 24th itself, with an extra trading day in the numbers they were talking about, I don't think allows anybodyreally to get under the skin of it. We've got Kantar tomorrow, and I guess everyone will look at that with interest."
44,18607813,WILLIAM MORRISON,01/09/2012,9:00AM,MRW.L,Wm Morrison Supermarkets P L C Christmas Trading Update ConferenceCall,Richard Pennycook,Morrison Supermarkets Plc,CFO,False,True,False,"I think what you might have missed on the beginning there, Al, was this point that I made that the last seven days saw a markeduplift in the amount of sales falling into that seven days if you compare it to previous years. So it was up 25% on two years ago, theamount that fell in those last seven days. Now clearly, part of that is Christmas on a Sunday, but not all of it, and it just shows theextent to which people were holding off, holding off, holding off and then spending at the last moment."

Sorry that we got off a little bit late. As I said, that was the quantity of calls comingin. And we look forward to speaking to you in March. Thank you."
