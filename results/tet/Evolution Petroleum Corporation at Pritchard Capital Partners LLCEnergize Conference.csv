Happy New Year to all of us. I am Bob Herlin. I'm the founder of the Company been aroundnow for going on eight years. Direct you to our forward-looking statement cautionary notes. Evolution is an engineering-based company focused on putting together development projects based on our particular expertise.We're a low-riskdevelopment company. The one thing that may set us apart from others is that our focus is strictly on building value per share as opposed toearnings per share every quarter, whatever. Our focus is strictly on how do we get the value per share up for our shareholders and get that valueto them? Quick facts. We are an American Stock Exchange company. We have both a common and a perpetual preferred share that just came on the marketthis summer. We have a June 30 fiscal year-end date so, again, that sets us a little apart from a lot of our peer group. Market cap is roughly $260 million with enterprise value of about $250 million, since we have no debt. So, therefore, our enterprise value is lessthan our market cap. We have very strong balance sheet since there is no debt, we have a very strong working capital, and a great team recordgoing forward. We really look at the Company as having three phases of growth so far. Initial phase was a core acquisition, core asset acquisition, and consolidatingthat asset. Second was positioning ourselves for growth, taking our cash that we have from our farmout in '06 and redeploying it into new projects.And where we are right now is our Phase III, our redeployment phase, where we're starting to generate substantial cash flow from our core assets.And we're redeploying that cash into new areas of development growth. Our assets are in Northern -- Northeastern Louisiana. That's where our CO2 project is, which is our biggest asset. 100% oil, around 16.7 millionbarrels of reserves net to the Company. 41% of that is developed and producing as of June 30 of 2011. Our other assets include the Giddings Field in Central Texas, which is really more of an interim project for us. It's 50% oil condensate and gas liquid,and 50% gas. We have current production there. We have some additional proved locations to drill. In South Texas, we have 100% oil project that'sa redevelopment of an oil field, and then we have a pure gas play in East Oklahoma but given current gas prices, that is a project that's on our backburner. Looking at standard valuation metrics of the Company, we have approximately 20 million barrels of net reserves to the Company almost 14 millionof that is proved 6 million is probable -- those are high-quality probable reserves almost all associated -- essentially all associated with our CO2project. As you can see, we're extremely oily, and this is a black oil, not condensate, not gas liquids. And high -- fairly high level of development. PV-10 netof CapEx is about $450 million, which [$376 million] is proved. On a PV-10 per fully diluted share, that works out to about $13.50 per share. One ofthe things, again, that sets us apart from our peer group -- and I'd really like to point this out -- is what is the required future capital expendituresgoing forward to net those 20 million barrels reserves?"
