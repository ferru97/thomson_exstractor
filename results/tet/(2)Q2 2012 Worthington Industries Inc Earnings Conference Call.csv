Also, in addition tothat, where has its historical revenue been and EBITDA margins throughout the peak trough and kind of average throughout thecycle?"
4,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Andy Rose,Worthington Industries,VP and Chief Financial Officer,False,True,False,"Two -- well the first question, the historical D&A, or the go-forward D&A isn't finalized yet, because we haven't completed the purchaseprice allocation, but a good benchmark is probably $8.5 million to $9.5 million. The second question -- in terms of their margins through the cycle-- it is a high variable cost business, and they've done a terrificjob, actually, through the cycle at maintaining margins. In fact, I think if you look back over the past several years, they've maintaineddouble-digit margins."
5,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Martin Englert,Jefferies & Co,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay. Would that be within a low double-digit range? Like, 10%, 12%?"
6,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Andy Rose,Worthington Industries,VP and Chief Financial Officer,False,True,False,"Yes, that would be the trough."

9,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Martin Englert,Jefferies & Co,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay. And if I could, one other question. Can you provide an update on your European cylinders business? How that contributed toearnings through the past quarter here, and where you see the activity and volumes trending in upcoming quarters here goingforward?"
10,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Andy Rose,Worthington Industries,VP and Chief Financial Officer,False,True,False,"Yes. The European cylinder business continues to recover both volumes and earnings. It is nowhere near back where it was duringthe peak, which is probably four-ish years ago in terms of its earnings, but the recovery does continue in that business."
11,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Martin Englert,Jefferies & Co,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay. And for -- within that segment, for restructuring charges, could we expect additional ones going forward in upcoming quartershere?"

You may recall we have started the transformation process there our Centers ofExcellence teams have been through one facility.They are just kicking off the second facility. Charges related -- most of the restructuringcharges to date have been for outside consulting that we brought in. Those charges will be declining starting this quarter.
15,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Martin Englert,Jefferies & Co,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay, thanks for all the color."

Great quarter. I had -- I guess I had a question about your Other segment. It sounds like you said that upfront investmentsright now are hurting earnings there. How long do you expect that to continue? And can you elaborate a little bit on the opportunitiesthat you're pursuing there?
20,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,John McConnell,Worthington Industries,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,False,True,False,"Nate -- and thank you for your earlier comment. Think of the investment is really -- as you know, we've done a project abroad inMozambique very successfully, and we had this operating in North America prior to moving to international. So this is really keepingin place the infrastructure that allows us to do the engineering, to do the work that puts us in position to do these projects. We have, as Andy said, some very large opportunities, significantly larger than Mozambique, that will be difficult to put a timeframeon them.They are government-involved, as was Mozambique, and so we'll see how they come to fruition. If they start to lose traction,whatever timeframe that is, and I would suspect we'll know this someplace in a six to nine-month period, probably sooner, but I'mnot sure. Then we will have to make some judgments. But until then, as long as these opportunities appear like they're going to gettraction, it is worthwhile leaving the infrastructure in place so that we're able to do the work."
21,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Nate Carruthers,Steel Market Intelligence,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay, thank you."

First I wanted to ask a little bit on automotive. I think you guys have a pretty good view on what's going onthere. It seems like the sentiment is getting a little bit better across the channel. I'm just wondering what you guys are seeing? I guessif you could talk a little bit more specifically, going into the next couple of months?."
24,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,John McConnell,Worthington Industries,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,False,True,False,"I think we feel generally positive about automotive. As George pointed out, overall steel bookings are up. I couldn't go to it bysegment, but we all track it here in different ways, and every way we track it shows forward bookings strengthening quite a bit,particularly when I look on a year-over-year basis.They're much stronger than they were at this time last year coming out of December.So that's very encouraging. I don't know if George has any more color on automotive specifically for you or not."
25,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,George Stoe,Worthington Industries,President and Chief Operating Officer,False,True,False,"I would say, John, you hit the nail on the head. I think that we're seeing stronger bookings that we have over the past few months,and certainly going into calendar 2012, we've seen a sharp increase in bookings coming from the automotive sector."
26,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Chris Olin,Cleveland Research Company,Analyst,False,True,False,"Is it realistic to think that the auto side of your business could improve by 10% to 15% in 2012, given where the production schedulesare headed?"
27,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,John McConnell,Worthington Industries,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,False,True,False,"Certainly coming into this call, I did not sit down and calculate what I thought a percentage increase was with automotive. I do thinkit is going to continue to improve, and I think in this -- the way everything is right now, the way -- is why we always work like we'regoing to do -- our goal is to increase, year over year, our earnings and keep driving things forward. And I think we are continuing to incrementally do this.That is a good sign.You have people worried about what Europe could triggerhere in the US, and those kind of issues are still going on. And until they calm down, it is going to be very difficult for somebody toget really robust in their predictions for you."
28,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Chris Olin,Cleveland Research Company,Analyst,False,True,False,"I know you guys talked a bit about how you are protected from the RG Steel issue I'm just curious, since this announcement hasbeen out there, has that firmed up the pricing environment? Do you guys have any different thoughts on where the sheet pricescould go?"
29,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,George Stoe,Worthington Industries,President and Chief Operating Officer,False,True,False,"I certainly think that it has, Chris. I think some of the mills out there locked into putting additional increase on as a result of that,because they saw that their backlogs were filling as a result of the uncertainty about that. But, I can't make a prediction on wherethe prices will go. I think there are too many factors that weigh in on that. Obviously, we've seen a number of increases over the lastfew months."
30,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Chris Olin,Cleveland Research Company,Analyst,False,True,False,Okay. I'll get in the queue.

Good afternoon, guys. The Nuconsteel closure announcement today by Nucor, how big of a player was it, then, in thefield of framing?"
33,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,John McConnell,Worthington Industries,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,False,True,False,"I would -- in the space in which we played, I would say not very large. They largely focused their efforts on smaller structures,single-family homes and that kind of things. So we didn't see them that much. And abroad, I think they have been in some conversationsthat we have been in, but of course that would tend to end that conversation. So, not huge."
34,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Sal Tharani,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay. On the Angus cab business, is it just the cab they make, or do they also work on the controls or incorporate controls in thatcab when they put that on the machines?"
35,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Andy Rose,Worthington Industries,VP and Chief Financial Officer,False,True,False,"They put controls in the machines they do not make the controls. They typically are sourcing those from other third parties. Butthere is an opportunity -- one of the opportunities for Angus is to continue to insource the manufacturing of other parts, obviouslythe metal components, which they have a great deal of expertise would make the most sense, but electronics is not out of thequestion down the road."
36,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,John McConnell,Worthington Industries,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,False,True,False,"As I understand it, they're more likely -- or we are more likely at this point I should say to be concentrated on things that would touchthe cab around the piece of equipment. So you might come down into the fenders, or you might come down in the doorwell or thestairwell or something like that, so that it all just fits together."
37,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Sal Tharani,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,False,True,False,"And that growth will come from Angus, or you will do some bolt-on acquisitions around it?"
38,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,John McConnell,Worthington Industries,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,False,True,False,we think the growth -- that growth that I just discussed was on Angus's agenda before we acquired them.
39,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Sal Tharani,Goldman Sachs,Analyst,False,True,False,"Okay, great. One more question -- you mentioned, you did -- alluded to the RG Steel impact or steel sourcing impact. Are you havingany difficulty in sourcing steel?"
40,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,George Stoe,Worthington Industries,President and Chief Operating Officer,False,True,False,"No, not at all, Sal. I mentioned in my comments, we had a careful plan in place as our business was growing somewhat with them,but we always had a thought in our mind that we had to make sure that we were cautious in going forward with that, and we'rehopeful that they're going to be able to come out of the current challenges they are facing. They've been a good supplier for us inthe time that we have been doing business with them. We do nothing but wish them well and hope that they can recover."

I was wonderinghow can you differentiate between tolling and non-tolling in there?
42,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,George Stoe,Worthington Industries,President and Chief Operating Officer,False,True,False,It's about 51 direct and about 49 is toll business.

44,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,John McConnell,Worthington Industries,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,False,True,False,No. The historic norm here would be something like 56/44. (multiple speakers)

A mid-50s number for direct and a mid-40s number or so for tolling, if you look back. This quarter wassomewhat aberrational in that sense."

With regard to Angus, roughly how much of the revenues is the steel they buy to makethe cabs?"
50,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Andy Rose,Worthington Industries,VP and Chief Financial Officer,False,True,False,"Is a smaller percentage than you would think, John. It's probably in the 15% range."

We did not take that into account as we were doingthis transaction, didn't do the pricing based on that. And it's uncertain how much we will switch as a result. So we are going to takethat very slowly, very cautiously. They have good suppliers right now, and so it all depends on the material, where we have plantslocated, whether we have the capabilities to do what they want to do. And all of that has been looked on a cursory basis, but notvery deep at this point."

A couple of quick questions. I read that China has a goal of building 45 million housing units in five years. I was wonderingif Worthington is going to participate in that? And I had a very nice visit in Mozambique in October to an 80-foot-thick met coal seam of Vallet, and I was wondering if you couldtalk a little bit more about your opportunity -- the business you did in Mozambique."
57,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,John McConnell,Worthington Industries,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,False,True,False,"In China, we would hope that we participate in the housing push. The project that the joint venture has taken on at the momentwill be somewhat oriented toward housing as part of a new industrial science center that is being built as part of a new ring city. Butcertainly all of -- eight story -- actually, six-story structures will come up in our building methodologies there. Some of that will behousing. Beyond that we will continue to look for projects. I think the housing market in China is a little unsettled at the moment. So theMinistry, I think, has, I'm guessing, the motivation to hurry up on this lower-end housing to try to add stability to the housing market.Because as I would understand it, that is one of the things that is putting uncertainty into buying homes, whether or not prices willgo down or not. So the sooner they get this floor of low-end housing out there and set up, I think they would expect to see stabilitycome to the rest of the housing market. So they should be motivated to do so, and we expect to participate in some. Now, with Mozambique, John, you said you were just there for something which I'm not sure I understood."

Our structures were all around the Pan-African Games, All-African Games, I believe it was called, to house the athletes. Therewere 22 buildings, essentially 22.5 buildings, to house the athletes. I'm sure -- I'm not sure. I'm assuming that the Mozambiquegovernment will turn that into low-end housing for their residents going forward."

Good afternoon. A couple of quick questions. I think you mentioned regarding steel processing that for this quarter, inventoryholding losses were roughly $0.09. Is it fair to say that we should expect this to reverse in the next quarter, given where steel priceshave moved?"
66,18590877,WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES INC,01/05/2012,6:30PM,WOR,Q2 2012 Worthington Industries Inc Earnings Conference Call,Andy Rose,Worthington Industries,VP and Chief Financial Officer,False,True,False,"I wouldn't expect it to reverse such that you have $0.09 of gain next quarter. I would say we've reached the -- assuming steel pricescontinue to migrate up, we've reached the inflection point, and that inflection point will occur sometime during the quarter to wherewe will start having gains. In terms of whether or not we have losses or gains for the third quarter, I would say it is unclear at thispoint. You need to ultimately figure out what the sales for the quarter are going to be, and that will unfold over the next couple ofmonths."

And then regarding volumes, can you give us a sense of how shipments ran on a monthly basis throughthe quarter? And if you could give us some color on -- I know you mentioned that things were -- demand was picking up, but maybehow December looked, and January?"

Then, back to the cylinders business, Andy, I think you had mentioned that Europe was recovering.

I guess it sounds strange to say that Europe is recovering, considering you pick up the newspaper or watch the news and listento what's going on. But you have to remember, our European cylinder business was off almost 70% in terms of the volumes duringthe downturn. And so as that business has recovered over the last 18 months, it's returned to profitability and continues to migrate upward. I wouldsay -- you heard me mention, also, it's nowhere near back to the level of profitability that it was three or four years -- four years ago,I guess at this point. In terms of the strength of the European economy, obviously we're not economists, but I think there's a lot of uncertainty there. Soin terms of where it goes from here, your guess is probably as good as mine."

One was for an investment banker in Europe related to the STAKO acquisition, and the second fee was related to thattransaction sort of a transfer tax, if you will.
