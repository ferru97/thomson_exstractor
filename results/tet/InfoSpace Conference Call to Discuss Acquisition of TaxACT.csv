1,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Clay Moran,The Benchmark Company,Analyst,False,True,False,"Good morning. A couple of things. Could you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape where TaxACT fits in, what the barriersto entry are? And seems like TaxSlayer may be somewhat new to the market, what do they represent in terms of a competitive threat? Secondly, just any change to management that is considered at this point -- TaxACT management, are they all staying on and what'stheir incentive to stay?"
2,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Yes, thanks, Clay. So the tax preparation market is -- consists of established providers, names you have heard of over time, H&R Block,and other off-line typically historically off-line paid professionals who prepare. The market is roughly 60% today on the side ofprofessionals and paid preparers and then about 40% what's called do-it-yourself, which historically has been pen and paper, morerecently has been desktop software and even more recently has been online.     And the dynamics are not unlike dynamics, Clay, as I mentioned in my comments, that you see in other consumer segments wherejust online is an easier way to do it. And there are some hurdles you've got to get over as it relates to the perceived complexities oftax preparation and some of the consumer inhibitions around using an online service to do something like tax preparation. But nevertheless, that shift is underway. It's one that we recognize from other consumer verticals. The competitive landscape as it relates to the do-it-yourself includes Intuit, which is a large and respected player in the space H&RBlock is also online with an online solution TaxACT is a leader as we have talked about. You mentioned TaxSlayer, there's a coupleof other players that would I think probably properly be put in the value segment within the online landscape. And I would say the barriers to entry principally, Clay, are really around the product and the domain expertise of providing consumerswith an easy way to do their taxes in an online format. That is -- as simple as that may seem to say, it's a very sophisticated offeringand capability that TaxACT has developed over a decade and prior to that at a different company. And the translation of what can be a rather complicated and confusing set of rules and procedures as they might apply to an individualas they progress through life, translating that into an interview style product offering that gets people comfortable with doing suchan important thing online is actually a nontrivial thing and really deeply resides in product and understanding of the tax code andtranslating that into something from a consumer interface standpoint that is intuitive and comfortable. So it really is just I think it has a lot to do with domain expertise, which is not uncommon for an industry like this."
3,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Clay Moran,The Benchmark Company,Analyst,False,True,False,One follow up there before you move on to the management. Any plans at all to alter the strategy and/or just enhance the marketinggiven that InfoSpace is traditionally an online marketing Company? Are there any tweaks to what they're doing that you feel youcan help the current situation?
4,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Well, certainly we are optimistic that we can help and enable what the TaxACT team is doing.We really do like the strategy they havebeen pursuing. I would say from a fit standpoint it lines up very well. We see a lot of cultural alignment between our two companiesat the core. We really do feel like there is the beginnings of a great relationship with the team in Cedar Rapids. So I would say that isprobably one of the best combination effects right off the bat. The second is we are both online companies and that's just through the DNA of both companies knowing what it means to ownand operate a website, the importance of keeping that website up to date, the importance of uptime and reliability, the importanceof security, all the aspects around being an online presence. And then the aspects with respect to product development and consumer marketing -- and I know you mentioned marketing inparticularly, those are two fundamental undertakings of the company of TaxACT that we think they're quite good at. We have beenimpressed by them in both of those realms and to the extent that we can help, we're absolutely prepared to do that and do so in acollaborative way. And as you can probably guess from the trended results of the company, the good news is that there's nothing broken at the momentso they're humming along and we have lots of discussions under way as to how we can help them.     I think, Clay, you had also asked a question about retention. And so the management team is sticking around, we have discussedroles with the team there that are unaltered. As I had mentioned in my introductory remarks, the team was one of the real attractivepoints for us in pursuing this combination. So we have as you might imagine, discussions and resolution as it relates to roles and responsibilities after this transaction."

6,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,False,True,False,Thanks a lot.
7,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Operator,NA,NA,False,True,False,"Kartik Mehta, Northcoast Research."
8,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Kartik Mehta,Northcoast Reasearch,Analyst,False,True,False,"Good morning. I was wondering, you gave some numbers as to what you thought the online market was growing and then you alsotalked about how well TaxACT was growing. And I'm wondering for the upcoming tax season, would you expect to grow in line withwhat you thought the online market was growing or is TaxACT in a position where you think you can grow faster?"
9,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Well, certainly it would be our expectation to grow in line with the market. It's early to speak to the 2011 tax year season as werereally just getting underway, as you know. But the company is excited about the plans it has in place. It has in the course of this year unlike -- not unlike prior years, learned a lot of things as it relates to the market and how it developedin calendar year 2010, tax year 2010. Applied those learnings into its product, applied those learnings into its marketing, thoughtsaround marketing budget and marketing mix and timing of its marketing spend. And so I think that they are very well positionedto have a good year and certainly it's everybody's expectation that they will grow with the market. One thing I would say is that historically the growth formula is very logically a function of getting consumers to come to the site,getting those that have worked with you in the past to revisit and reuse your product and then also making sure that they are makingit -- they have available to them a variety of offerings, some of which will be paid and that they make full use of those so that thatcan go to conversion within the funnel. And all of those levers are being pursued. I think from a pricing standpoint, the company has not historically taken aggressive pricing year on year. Price and value andaffordability are fundamental to its core message to consumers. And so I think that is a lever that they'll use more judiciously thanit simply will be trying to drive year on year revenue growth through pricing action. But to your core question as it relates to the unit volumes, certainly they are expecting to grow with the market."
10,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Kartik Mehta,Northcoast Reasearch,Analyst,False,True,False,"And so as I look at the numbers you presented in your presentation, obviously TaxACT grew revenue fairly well from FY '10 to FY '11.Would that imply that the corresponding customers grew in the same manner concerning your statement that they have not usedpricing really?"
11,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Right. So for the most part, but not exactly. So the other determinant there as it relates to revenue growth is going to be mix. Sothree to the extent that you had a constant mix from year to year, I think the answer to your question would be yes. But to the extentthat you have an evolved mix as it relates to paid versus nonpaid consumers and then on the paying consumers, what is the revenueper consumer as i.e., the attach rate around paid offerings? So there are differences, as you know, from year to year as it relates to that."
12,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Kartik Mehta,Northcoast Reasearch,Analyst,False,True,False,"I just want to make sure I understood the statement you said. So would it be fair to say that TaxACT will be more -- will be a little bitmore aggressive in how it prices its product, it has maybe more pricing power than the companies used in the past so now they'llhave more opportunity to use pricing as a way to grow?"
13,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Well I think I was speaking to their historical practice which historically that has not been -- that is a lever that many providers in themarketplace and anybody naturally offering something that consumers might use. I think however that the deliberation that goes on within the TaxACT team as to how and when they take pricing, those types oftopics are given a lot of thought because fundamentally one of the reasons why the following is as strong as it is is that it has awell-earned reputation for being a value provider, a provider of value, it's got a great product and it's also offered on great terms. And so care will be given as it relates to pricing decisions to make sure that they don't run awry of that relationship with theirconsumers. So was less offering a view into the future."
14,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Kartik Mehta,Northcoast Reasearch,Analyst,False,True,False,And then just one final question. Any thoughts about further consolidating the industry as there are some other smaller players inthe market that do online?
15,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Yes. So consolidation in the space has certainly been discussed. I think there -- in certain cases there would be advantages incombining, in TaxACT's case and InfoSpace and TaxACT's case with another player in the market. I think we would want to give somethought to what the expanded presence might be with consumers as it relates to the brands and what they signify. To the extentthose brands were entirely overlapping, I think the question would then go to more raw back-end economics and the advantagesof bringing two businesses together. But it is certainly something that is a possibility in the foreground."

Just going back to your description of the services, products and services that they currently offer, you talked about their --it's do-it-yourself but there's a combination of desktop software as well as the online. What is the current revenue mix between thetwo?"
20,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Eric Emans,InfoSpace,CFO,False,True,False,"Eric, it's Eric here. So right now, it's primarily driven by the online product, the desktop is declining over time as you would expectthose users to shift to online. So I would say about 70 -- over 70% of revenues coming from the online and desktop is at about 8%for tax year 2010."
21,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Eric Martinuzzi,Craig,Hallum,False,True,False,"I didn't follow that, you said online is primarily -- it is over 70 --."

26,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Eric Emans,InfoSpace,CFO,False,True,False,"You've got preparer -- we have a tax preparation offering and that is about 9%, and then we have some value-added services, bankproducts and Stored Value Cards."
27,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Eric Martinuzzi,Craig,Hallum,False,True,False,"As you -- the customer transformation, I imagine the first exposure for a consumer is the free federal online. What is the next thingthat consumers buy? Is it a state online or is it some kind of -- what's the upgrade past?"
28,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,False,True,False,"That's right, Eric, this is Bill. So that is absolutely right. The company has over the years been steadfast in offering and really the firstin offering free federal filings, which as you can imagine is of great interest to a good swath of the market.Those consumers that areresiding in states where their state income tax, that is an upsell to provide that and the company has a product that addresses allthe states there. And there is another -- there are other upgrades as it relates to that rate card and the pricing sheet with respect to the types ofservices that Eric had mentioned. There is a degree of stickiness as it relates to a consumer that enters in the first year whether theyare filing federal or federal and state as it relates to their information. And so the ability to access that information for retrieval purposes as it relates to future tax periods, for initiating your taxes in thecoming year is of great value and that is an example that is referred to as data archive service that the company offers, which wouldbe an example of a paid product above and beyond state. And then there are a variety of financial services including refund payment transfers, Stored Value Card solutions that offer consumersflexibility as it relates to the receipt of refunds and what they do with those refunds and how they are processed. Support is another important -- another element of their service, Eric, and consumers that are looking for more hand holding andwalk-throughs, they perceive complexity of their filings as such that they want to get on the phone with somebody that is offeredby the company as well."

At what point -- was this your firstgo at this entity? Can you give any sort of background as to -- because it seems like only November that H&R Block dropped theirefforts?"

It has been our first go at the company, as you say. And the company had announced an acquisition or a sale to H&RBlock in October of 2010, which didn't come together and that became clear toward the back half of 2011."

34,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Rich Tullo,Albert Fried & Company,Analyst,False,True,False,"Congratulations on your deal, it's been a long time in coming.You said 40% of the market is electronic. What percent of that marketis TaxACT?"
35,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Good morning, Rich, this is Bill. I think and it is important from a market definition standpoint to walk through it a little bit. To bemore specific, 40% is what we call do-it-yourself and do-it-yourself historically has been pen and paper, people just don't want topay a storefront provider to do their taxes, their taxes are simple or they're at a level of comfort and sophistication where they arehappy doing it on their own. And that particular segment has been undergoing a pretty radical shift over the last 15 years, which is the initial alternative methodthat was introduced was more of a CD-ROM desktop type offering where consumers could move away from pen and paper. Andthen more recently which has now been going on for some time has been the online capability, which is replacing not only pen andpaper but also now desktop. But that 40%, which is the do-it-yourself, that is the segment that really refers to that subset of the filing population that is comfortablewhether it's just -- they just prefer to do it on their own, they have privacy concerns, they have a perfect level of sophistication andcomfort doing it on their own. But that's what we refer to as do-it-yourself. The subset of do-it-yourself, which is referred to as digital do-it-yourself is 33% of the market. The numbers are not super precise asit relates to the sources but rough order of magnitude 140, 142 million filers in the US, 40% of which are in the do-it-yourself categorythrough whatever means and 33% of overall filers are in the digital do-it-yourself which includes both software and online. And thenthe online portion is 20% which is where we came up with the 30 million filers out of the 140 million."
36,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Rich Tullo,Albert Fried & Company,Analyst,False,True,False,Okay. Second question is what are the regulatory and legal events which are likely to influence the business over the next six to 18months? I guess this is an industry that's in some degree influenced by changes in the tax law. And how do you kind of look at that?
37,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,False,True,False,"It has historically been influenced by tax law. I think one of the real drivers of the opportunity we see in the digital online market isthe -- is really aided by the US government in terms of its initiatives around the Free File Alliance, which was in the early 2000steeming with industry participants to make it easy for individuals with incomes below $57,000 a year to file electronically which hasbeen a real catalyst. And also provides a lot of clarity with folks as to the dates of the filing and creates a rather regimented calendaryear in, year out.     To the extent that there is simplification on the horizon, this is a difficult thing for anybody to crystal ball, but to the extent that thetax code simplifies then you might imagine that consumers' perception of the complexity of their own filings will decrease which Ithink as well would be a catalyst to the reception of online and the migration toward online. So we would certainly see that as being a tailwind to the extent it happens but that's a difficult thing to speak to."

CapEx, what is the CapEx of this business? How is that going to integrate withyour own CapEx? And I guess we can ask the same question of non-cash executive compensation?"

Yes, there is equity compensation involved. We're not goingto provide any forward-looking guidance on that at this time. But yes, we will have stock-based compensation."

Bill, obviously since you've been leading the Company,I think a lot of people have been anticipating a transaction like this. However -- and of course the fact that you have spoken to it ingenerality would be one of the reasons why. I'm wondering if you could explain to us a little bit about how you decided on this company as opposed to one that might havebeen within the construct of what you and we might have considered related adjacencies? I think one of the big questions aboutthis transaction as much as it seems appealing on some levels is it doesn't seem to have a lot to do with your core business rightnow. And the second question I have is somewhat related, which is the prior proposed transaction between H&R Block and TaxACT, notcoincidently seemed to be for about the same amount of money. So I'm wondering how you came to the sum and did your valuationanalysis? Thanks."
51,18609070,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Yes, sure, thanks, Scott. Yes, it's very, very reminiscent of that price so I will let let you arrive at your own conclusions as to how it iswe arrrived at that valuation. It was negotiated outcome as you might imagine as these things typically are. And there was a degreeof opportunism on our part as it relates to pursuing this opportunity. So one of the things that I think we have spoken about in prior calls has been as it relates to the successfulness of our acquisitioneffort, making sure that we have the right resources in place, making sure that we have the right criteria established that best mapto our opportunity and where we think we can be successful and then also a degree of opportunism which is finding the rightsituation and making sure that we act with urgency in pursuit of an opportunity.     And this is I think straight down the fairway as it relates to those attributes that the idea of moving into an adjacent category thatwould be more directly complementary of search was certainly something that was in the consideration set. And so by virtue of thisannouncement, one should not assume that those types of opportunities weren't evaluated. This was one that was head and shoulders from our perspective more attractive, from a market opportunity perspective, from ourability to influence the outcome of what the company is doing. And that may be through means of the catalyst of new ownershipand adopting a philosophy of investment and resourcing and things that we're all very much stand at the ready to do with thisbusiness. But also in terms of cultural fit. We like the team, we think the team is doing really great things from their headquarters in CedarRapids, Iowa and we look forward to enabling them. And so I think that's the -- that's really the way to answer that question. If you have any sort of more specific questions related tothat, I'm happy to answer them."

Soit provided you guys with an opportunity. And I think that is something that you should be applauded for. But I guess what I'm wondering is, is it just that you didn't find what you wanted to find potentially in those adjacencies or was it avaluation issue or is it just that this opportunity arose and it was so compelling you had to move forward with it?"

There were plenty of things that we've looked at. I mean I think we've gone into some detail on prior calls as itrelates to the exhaustiveness of our effort and I think price has been an issue, Scott. So we have turned over a lot of rocks and thereare a lot of great companies out there, there are a lot of great companies that think they are worth on a multiple basis 15 to 20 timesEBITDA and so it's difficult to reconcile in those conversations. And so I think the alignment that we feel as it relates to this company is kind of the points I had walked through the before as itrelates to it being an online company, the DNA is very similar to the DNA at this Company. TaxACT has what I would characterize asa maniacal focus on the consumer, which is they have built relationships with over five million filers over the course of their 13-yearoperating history that is really quite astounding and speaks to their attention to product detail and attention to maintainingrelationships beyond an initial tax season. And it's those types of attributes that as we think about the investment criteria and where we thought we would be most successfulallocating our capital, that was absolutely one of those attributes which probably falls under the broader heading of just a reallygood company. And the fact that it's an online company and one that we think we're -- we understand and are positioned to help Ithink only adds to the rationale."

And the last question I had, just a really quick one if I may, any synergies you guys see on the revenue or on the cost side?"

My sense is that we're not coming at this from a cost rationalization standpoint in theslightest. As I had mentioned, we may even on a more likely case see opportunities to invest together where we haven't before. And from a revenue standpoint, there are going to be opportunities for the InfoSpace search business to more prominently featureTaxACT through the course of our search results pages and our display inventory and we're going to take advantage of those as youmight imagine and the next 3.5 months is a good time to do it."

Good morning, congratulations. I will only ask one question. Marketing expenses, the company has what looks to beabout a 45% operating margin.What are the marketing expenses in absolute terms maybe on a trailing 12? And how will you changethe marketing strategy at this business going forward?"

So marketing expense as you might imagine is a significant piece of the company's SG&A.Thespend is suffice it to say, well over $25 million a year. You could piece that together by looking at the results. The historical practice has been not unlike other consumer acquisition efforts where it's a multichannel marketing effort online andoff-line.There's a lot of experimentation and a lot of processing of learnings from one year to the next. Much of the buying that goeson is bought ahead of time as you might imagine, there's quite a lot of messaging in the marketplace this time of year between nowand the end of tax season as it relates to tax preparation. It's a seasonal business and in further communications, we are going toprovide more detail as to the breakout of the business by quarter. But they have spent it in online and off-line channels and have had greater success in some areas than others, they spent a decentamount of money in the search channel, which is an area where we spent a fair amount of time discussing and one we well understand. And so I think that I personally have been impressed by the company's direct marketing capabilities and the brand that they havebeen able to build with the profit disciplines in place. So to the extent that we can work with the management team to continuethat tradition and accelerate that tradition, we see that as a real opportunity."

First, just wondering if there's any change to the Board of Directors contemplated at this point specificallyis Andrew Snyder staying on in helping develop TaxACT? Secondly, do you have plans to pay down the debt and are there any terms that prevent you from paying it down quickly?"
