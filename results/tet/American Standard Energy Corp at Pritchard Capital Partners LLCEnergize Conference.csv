Thanks for coming to the Pritchard Energize Conference. Today we have American Standard Energy. We have Richard MacQueenand Scott Mahoney. So I think we're going to let Scott take it away here.

2,18608822,AMERICAN STANDARD ENERGY CORP,01/04/2012,9:40PM,ASEN.OB,"American Standard Energy Corp at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC""Energize` Conference",Scott Mahoney,American Standard Energy Corp.,CFO,False,True,False,"The areas of concentration [for family] have been centered in the Permian Basin, South Texas, and the Eagle Ford and in the Williston Basin in NorthDakota. The rationale for the public company has been very simple. Year one was to assemble some of the family's assets to do two basic things. Gain access to the public markets and have something that was highlymarketable, primarily centered around the non-operating position that the family had access to and we can bring in to the public sands, Centeron the Williston Basin. There are a number of notable comparable Company business profiles, Northern owned gas, Voyager Triangle that evolvedon something very similar over the last several years and that was ultimately our business model in the Bakken. But unlike some of the other basin-specific non-ops our end goal was to leverage the family's portfolio in the Permian Basin and in South Texas.Year one's top priority was to get the scale to be relevant in the public markets. And secondly, to structure a portfolio of proven producing reservesprimarily in the Permian Basin that would give us access to a credit facility. That large credit facility was put in place in September through an Australian bank called Macquarie. The most important thing to take away fromthat credit facility is that it is not a line of credit. It is project financing. They gave us $300 million worth of dry powder through which to put intodeveloping the family's assets. We are now in the middle of what will ultimately become a more mature platform. So let's compare and contrast what do you see on page 5 andwhat will you see in the very near term. We have announced the market that we are acquiring approximately 80,000 net acres. The majority of those net acres are in the Permian Basin,the Bakken, and in the Eagle Ford. That is our area of focus. Any other assets brought in are primarily brought in for appreciation potential, for divestiture. So that the reinvested capital can go back into thosethree basins I just listed. So we will have approximately 125,000 net acres, the majority of which are in the three basins you look at. So when you see a summary that describes 6,500 net acres today in the Permian, that is irrelevant. That is where we are temporarily, but in theshort term we will disclose exactly how many acres we have by county in the Permian Basin. It is all held by production.The majority of what we'rebringing in is focused on two very basic opportunities. One, for us to continue to rapidly develop our production base and we will speak of that in a moment. We want to take the lowest drillbit riskpossible. We will drill as many low risk vertical wells in very derisked plays as possible. We will continue to push our BOE up while leaving theoptionality to pursue what the real economic opportunity is and, ultimately, maybe what makes us very attractive for drilling partnerships or other"

I think there are three equity analysts that cover us now.They are all pretty consistent about the math and how it produces exit rate calculationsby well and in aggregate. I think realistically what you would see us do is layer on probably somewhere between 400 and 600 barrels in the firstthree to four months of the year. So realistically, we have a very reasonable shot at layering on approximately 500 barrels, somewhere towards the end of Q1, early Q2. Again I don'twant to pigeonhole us based upon specifics, but that is basically where the outlook is in the reasonable year term. I think by the end of the year ifwe do exactly what I described as far as incremental well activity throughout the year, our exit rate in the fourth quarter should somewhere bebetween maybe 3,400 to 3,500 barrels and it could be higher than that substantially. I think in our models we have a pretty clear path to essentially close to a double in production rates by the end of the year. But let's just play it safeand say that we are somewhere in the mid-3,000s. We haven't given public guidance on exit rates for the year. But we -- basically the analysts are all in pretty good consensus on where the numberskind of play out. Anything else?"

So, no, I think the most important thing to understand is our strategy in creating value is to leverage the scarcity of value of whatthe family has already aggregated. So our only position in the Eagle Ford today is one, AMI, and the operator is Cheyenne. And the only othermeaningful participants in that acreage is Chesapeake. So, they are doing just fine. They are doing a great job in drilling up. We have got some excellent production prospects for us. But the acreage wewill be bringing in, we control 100% of. So we can farm it out to the appropriate partners to drill it at scale if we choose to do so. Or we can proceedwith alternate ways to develop those assets, but the most important thing to differentiate is in the Permian Basin and in the Eagle Ford, in the nearterm, we will be a 100% working interest, held by production operator of record controlling those assets. Our main thrust is to take advantage of the scarcity value and what the family has aggregated over time. Good question."

We have about 40,000 net acres almost exactly today. We have articulated that we are adding about 80,000. Just take me on my word and sayit is going to be right now 120,000, 125,000. So obviously, we are going to look very little like what we do today. And that is the other major question the market needs to see addressed is whatdo we look like when we're done, county by county, lease by lease, and how do we pay for it. Obviously needs time to market so it is always goingto have a fear factor. [Extremely] worried how many shares do we have to issue to get this deal done? I mean the family already owns 40% of thepublic company and we are tripling the size of the Company so they own 90% of the stock when this thing is done. And respectively speaking, the answer is no. But the specifics of the deal have not been disclosed. I think it is just prudent to say I think when theterms of the deal are disclosed, the market will be reasonably pleased. Anything else? Great. Thank you very much for your time."
