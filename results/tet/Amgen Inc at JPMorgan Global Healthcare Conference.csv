Delighted to have the opportunity to talk to you this morning about Amgen and to share with you the reasonswhy I'm excited about the new year at our Company. But before I do that, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about the year just past, 2011. And I'm pleased with how we ended 2011 in particular,pleased with the momentum that we had at the end of the year. We'll report results in a few weeks time and when we do, you will see that our performance in 2011 was solid across the board. You'll see that wedelivered revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth again this year and we did that off the back of strength and growth in the newly launchedproducts, in particular our denosumab franchise, which includes both XGEVA and Prolia. And in their first year on the market together, we generatedin excess of $500 million of revenues from this new franchise. So we're delighted with the performance in particular of XGEVA, which as you know launched very strongly in the United States early in the year.We demonstrated once again the power in this industry of a simple word, a single simple word and that word is superiority. So XGEVA has demonstrated again the power of being able to launch a medicine that has been demonstrated with three pivotal Phase III trials tobe superior to the standard of care and physicians and patients have rapidly adopted XGEVA here in the US. Prolia for those of you who have been following Prolia closely including in the fourth quarter, you will know that the momentum for Prolia builtagain in the fourth quarter and we are following the progress of this launch very carefully as you would expect and pleased with the growth thatwe saw for Prolia in the fourth quarter and we'll have more to say about that obviously on the earnings call in a few week's time. In addition, we're pleased with the progress of Neulasta in 2011. It's been an objective of ours for some time to grow the Neulasta franchise worldwideand I'm delighted that we did just that in 2011. So grastim is about a $5 billion franchise for us worldwide Neulasta comprises about three-quartersof that and we demonstrated solid unit volume growth from Neulasta last year as well as price growth. So Neulasta was a strong contributor to ourresults in 2011 and we have good momentum heading into 2012 for that franchise. Enbrel, as you know, Enbrel is our leading molecule in the rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis space and we're delighted again with the progressthat we demonstrated in maintaining leading market shares for Enbrel throughout 2011."
