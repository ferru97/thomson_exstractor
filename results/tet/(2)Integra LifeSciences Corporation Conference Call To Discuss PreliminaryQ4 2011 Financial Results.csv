Certain preliminary and estimatedfinancial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2011 and certain preliminary guidance for 2012. Both the preliminary results and the revisionsto our 2012 preliminary guidance are below our prior estimates and Street expectations. We are announcing preliminary results and guidanceearlier than we ordinarily would so that we can have useful conversations with analysts and investors about our expected results between nowand the announcement of our audited 2011 results at the end of February, including meetings with investors next week. Jack will review thepreliminary results with more detail than in yesterday's release, and then I will discuss the trends in the business that drove the results and shape     our expectations for 2012. We also announced yesterday that we received the anticipated warning letter regarding our Plainsboro manufacturingfacility. I will also update you on our assessment of it and on the status of our Plainsboro manufacturing facility. At the end of the call we will takeyour questions on these topics. Jack?"

We expect total revenues in the fourth quarter to be approximately $202 million to $203 million. The revenue shortfall resultedfrom inventory reduction initiatives by our instruments distributors, weakness outside the US, and weaker than expected sales of our domesticExtremity products.We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.70 for the fourth quarter of 2011, and between$2.74 to $2.79 for the full-year. We expect GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.20 for the fourth quarter of 2011, andbetween $0.87 and $0.99 for the full-year 2011. At this stage in our close we have a pretty good sense of revenue but our process takes a few moreweeks for other items. Keep in mind these reports are preliminary and numbers are subject to change. We estimate that Orthopedics revenue,which includes products sold to foot, hand, spine and orthopedic surgeons increased over the fourth quarter of 2010 by approximately 19%.Extremity Reconstruction which is the largest component of our Orthopedics category grew in the low teens. Sales of legacy Foot and Ankleproducts declined primarily because our sales force was devoting its attention to learning the Ascension product line and customer base. A processthat we believe will continue into the first quarter but resolved by Q2. Our Regenerative Medicine products sold through the Extremity sales force increased mid-single digits versus the prior-year period.The backorderwas below our previous estimates, but managing the backorder with customers took significant selling time away from legacy products. We alsoexpect these issues to resolve by the second quarter. The minutes in our domestic Extremity's products accounted for about 25% of our revenueshortfall against our internal estimates. Spine sales increased significantly in the quarter driven by the SeaSpine acquisition. Both our Spine hardwareand Orthobiologic product lines grew by double digits compared to the prior-year period. Private label was roughly flat versus the prior-year period.Neurosurgery revenues declined slightly in the fourth quarter. While Europe held to our expectations, delayed product registrations and weakperformance by one of our key distributors in Asia-Pacific caused most of the sales shortfall. In the United States, revenues were down slightly.Sales of Neuro capital products were relatively light versus a strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2010 while sales of implants and neurocritical care products grew well. Instrument revenue in the fourth quarter decreased approximately 10% compared to last year. Sales of Instruments in the acute care settingdecreased in the low single digits. Sales in the Alternate Site channel were substantially lower, due to lower stocking purchases. Several of Integra'skey distributor customers reduce their inventory levels.The miss in Alternate Site instruments accounted for more than 50% of the revenue shortfallversus our internal estimates. Consolidated international revenue increased approximately 1% over prior-year. A combination of ongoing macrochallenges in Europe and delayed product registration approvals in Asia-Pacific cause the shortfall in the revenue performance for the fourthquarter. The miss in international sales accounted for about 25% of the revenue shortfall against our internal estimates. We are not reportingpreliminary results for gross margin percentage, operating expenses by line item, tax rate or cash flow, all of which will be available when we reportour final 2011 results in late February. Now I'll turn the call back over to Pete."
4,18595945,INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,IART,Integra LifeSciences Corporation Conference Call To Discuss PreliminaryQ4 2011 Financial Results,Peter Arduini,Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp,CEO,False,True,False,"Thank you, Jack. Obviously we're disappointed by the loss of momentum in our business in the last seven weeks of the quarter, particularly in thelast three weeks.Which are usually very strong for us.The biggest surprises for us came from the Instruments product lines particularly in AlternateSite, the domestic Extremity's products and certain international markets.The Instruments product line under performed primarily because of themajor distributors that reduced the amount of inventory of our products that they typically carry at the end of the year. We know the AlternateSite product line is fundamentally sound because the end-user sales data we have suggests our products are holding up well. The domestic Extremity products under performed on the top line compared to our expectations for two main reasons. First, while the Ascensionintegration is proceeding according to plan, we underestimated the extent to which the integration activities would distract the sales force fromselling. Second, the reps spent more time than we expected managing through the Collagen product supply issues. These distractions adverselyaffect sales of our legacy Extremity's products in the quarter. We expect that both issues will continue into the first quarter but will be resolved by     Q2. All of that said, the integration of Ascension is going well and we are more excited than ever about the potential of these products in our hands.And finally we were disappointed with our results in the international markets. Now, switching over to talk about 2012 -- because of the slower revenue growth in the fourth quarter the international challenges particularly inEurope the strengthening of the dollar and slightly lower growth expectations for domestic Extremity's products, we are revising our view of 2012.We expect reported revenues to in increase approximately 8% on a constant currency basis and 7% on in the aggregate over 2011 final revenues.We expect to grow our adjusted earnings per share by approximately 8% to 9% over 2011. As Jack commented earlier, we will provide detailedguidance regarding revenues by product category, gross margin, and expense lines with our full-year 2011 financial results in February. In spite ofthe tough environment, we have numerous reasons to be optimistic about 2012 and beyond. Our Spine and Biologics products are well-positionedwith integrated sales organization, the Extremity's organization is trained in selling the Ascension products, and excited to have a new base ofsurgeons and products. Our Neuro sales force has new products on tap for later in the year, and out the door sales of our Alternate Site Instrumentsremain stable, as is our share. So we also expect revenues there to bounce back in 2012. Finally, we did receive a warning letter with respect to our Plainsboro facility. The letter is available as an exhibit to the 8-K we filed last night. Andyou will see it contains no surprises. As we said in anticipation of it at our analyst day in November, we were already reacting to last summer'sinspection of our Plainsboro facility as if we had gotten a warning letter. And we continue to do so. Indeed our remediation of the facility has trackedthe schedule we outlined in November and all clean rooms were in production at the end of December.We now believe that our supply issues willrecede by the end of the first quarter, which will remove a major distraction for the Extremity sales force in particular. While I obviously wish I hadbetter financial news to deliver on my first call as Integra's CEO, my enthusiasm for Integra's future is undiminished. We have a great organizationthat puts surgeons and patients first, unique products in Regenerative Medicine, Orthobiologics and Pyrocarbon implants, and are in businessesthat have opportunities to grow for years and years to come. I'll see many of you I'm sure in San Francisco next week, and we'll talk about Integra's growth prospects in more detail during my presentation atthe JPMorgan conference on Wednesday. Now I'll take your questions. In an effort to keep this call to a reasonable length, please do limit yourselfto one question and remember, that we will not provide final or detailed results for 2011 or detailed guidance for 2012 until the fourth quarterearnings call in late February. Rejoin the queue if you have more questions. Operator, you may now turn the call over to our participants."

And then on the margin side, you were really looking for kind of the mix to Extremity's and Orthopedics broadly kind ofdriving the margin expansion. And yet, in the third quarter and then here now in the fourth quarter, both of those things seem to have yet to reallymaterialize. International, as you mentioned, still weak. Extremity's weak for a number of reasons. But I'm curious whether what's going on herehas really caused you to kind of go back and reassess whether that strategy laid out is really the best one for growing the Company going forward?"
7,18595945,INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,IART,Integra LifeSciences Corporation Conference Call To Discuss PreliminaryQ4 2011 Financial Results,Peter Arduini,Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp,CEO,True,False,False,"Yes, Raj, thanks for the question. I think overall our strategy has not changed. I think when we take a look at our broader outlook, the points thatyou made about our international opportunity -- as you know, it's over 77%, 75% of our overall growth is still domestic.We have a large opportunity,and we're making good progress on registrations, infrastructure, our new office capabilities. So, when I take a look at, over our next three- to     five-year horizon, very, very solid from an international standpoint. Extremities, as you spoke of and as we mentioned at the investor conference,relative to accretion really in Orthopedics bringing higher gross margin rates to the overall business, we still believe is there. The reality of it isthough our expectations for the growth that we thought we would have in Q4 didn't meet our expectations, and with that we've tempered our2012 expectations because of that. Then Jack, if you'd like to add any comments?"
8,18595945,INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,IART,Integra LifeSciences Corporation Conference Call To Discuss PreliminaryQ4 2011 Financial Results,Jack Henneman,Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp,CFO,True,False,False,"Yes. I mean, I think that the main point around Extremities, just to pound the point home because we just said it in the script, is that we think we'vegot specific rifle shot issues that are transitory. And we are, I think, doing everything we need to do on the Ascension integration, but moving salesfrom a distributed sales force to a direct sales force requires a lot of training, a lot of attention, the absorption of a lot of knowledge. Similarly, we've been managing our supply issues out of the Plainsboro plant well, I think. The backorder came in well below the number we hadsort of put out there back in November. But I think the thing we didn't quite appreciate was how much time it would take the sales force to respondto the needs of the customer by moving product around. We're trying to be realistic, and say we think that will continue into the first quarter. So,that has also tempered our view of things. But overall, we think the business is healthy, the sales force is very excited by the Ascension opportunity.We have unique material in the Pyrocarbon that is opening all kinds of new doors and exciting the existing doctors. So again, we believe this to betemporary, not longer term, and hope that by the Summer, we are rocking."

I just wonder as we think about some of these integration-related disruptions in thefourth quarter, how confident are you in sort of SeaSpine integration and no disruption to the Spine business broadly defined heading into 2012?"
12,18595945,INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,IART,Integra LifeSciences Corporation Conference Call To Discuss PreliminaryQ4 2011 Financial Results,Peter Arduini,Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp,CEO,True,False,False,"David, it's Peter, I'll comment and then Jack, you can add some thoughts to that. I think where we are with the SeaSpine integration, we feel verygood that we've integrated the distributor structure. We're cross-pollinating our products we've got a lot of systems in place and marketingstructure in place that took a good chunk in 2011. And so we had stable results really in Q4, and we see that continuing really into 2012. On the Extremity aside, remind you that we were actually integrating a distributor structure into a direct sales force as to combining two distributorstructures as we did in Spine. And some of that activity obviously now in retrospect is taking a little bit more time to get that integrated into ourdirect team. That being said, our teams are well trained, as I mentioned, now, up to speed on those product lines, feeling good about the newsurgeon relationships that they have. And we believe obviously starting into the new year we'll be able to get some of that disruption behind us. Jack, you may want to --?"
13,18595945,INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,IART,Integra LifeSciences Corporation Conference Call To Discuss PreliminaryQ4 2011 Financial Results,Jack Henneman,Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp,CFO,True,False,False,"I think that's exactly right. I mean, when we look back over these two integrations, I'd say we think we're doing the right things in both cases. Thatdoesn't mean that we have perfectly anticipated what would happen to revenues in every circumstance, which is a question about anticipatingforecasting rather than actually executing. But the thing to bear in mind is that they are different in -- the integration of these distribution systems,as Pete said, are different. One was SeaSpine, distributor to distributor where there was very little overlap, and indeed, most distributors in bothorganizations were retained. In the Ascension side, we were terminating most, not all, but most of the distribution network, and moving thosesales to a direct sales force that obviously causes more conflict. Overall, it held up pretty well. I'd say we should have anticipated more disruptionthan we did."

And it sounded like therewere some issues in the third quarter that weren't necessarily the same issues in the fourth quarter, specifically thinking of the training. And againgoing back to the meeting coming off of the third quarter call and your analyst meeting, it sounded like some of the third quarter issues weretransitory. Can you give us some color in terms of the end market and maybe the availability of some of your Biologics, your Collagen products,were those things that, all other things being equal, ex the distraction of your sales force, do you believe that the end market, the demand, thevolume was there and this was more of a sales distraction? And then second, if you could give some sense as to when -- you mentioned middle of the year or the Summer, is it going to be a couple of quarters?Can we see an improvement in Q1? Any color on sort of timing would be helpful. Thanks."
17,18595945,INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,IART,Integra LifeSciences Corporation Conference Call To Discuss PreliminaryQ4 2011 Financial Results,Peter Arduini,Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp,CEO,True,False,False,"Yes, Matt, it's Pete I'll make some comments on it. Relative to the market and our growth, I mean we still believe that the market, as was mentionedin Q3, had softened from, say, previous points in the first half of 2011. But we don't believe there's been any substantial changes in the market atthis point. Now, the fact is, we don't have a lot of other information from other folks reporting in with our reporting early, but we don't have anyindications that procedures have substantially changed or anything of that nature. From a Biologics standpoint and our proliferation of our product, that's advancing well within our Extremity's business. It also has done well withinour Spine business as well, just to mention. And so, the main focus is, as we mentioned, is the distraction relative to the two areas. The integrationcomponents that we spoke to, and really, as we were actually tight on supply on a lot of the Regenerative products, in the fourth quarter matchingup the right level of products to the right customers, while the combination of training and while also doing the integration, we overestimatedthe amount of burden it would put on the sales team. To your point about, into the new year, as Jack commented on, we believe that in Q2, we'llbe able to get this resolved and get it behind us."

Are you saying to us that you expect that share to come right back bythe second quarter? I would imagine your competitors aren't just going to sit back and let you come right back into accounts and gain share back,so maybe talk to us a little about your expectations for share recapture. Because it sounds to me like you're expecting the run rates to return backto normal levels by 2Q? Thanks."

And if you highlight the discussion on Instruments, which Jack commented on was ourbiggest component of the miss, that ties with reduced levels of inventory. We know that that share is being consistent, so that we haven't hadshare loss there. In Extremity's area, whether we have had loss from share in the mid foot, hind foot area, we don't necessarily have all of that datayet. The key though is, is the integration of 20 new products, new coverage of surgeons and capability just of our new reach, we're going to beable to pull back share. The question of -- is it the exact surgeons and things that we might have lost some cases to? Yet to be seen. But with theopportunities of growth with bringing Ascension in to bring both of our products together, we feel confident that we'll be able to grow share."

Andthat's a very different market. And we think we'll get that back. We have unique products there. It's really a different animal than the Orthopedicshardware."

That's very good color. Can I just hit one more follow-up, just on the warning letter, it sounds like the warning letter is not going to cost the Company any more from anexpense point of view. Is that correct? And then second, usually when a company gets a warning letter, the FDA doesn't approve any more productsthat would be pending at the FDA that would be made at that facility. Is that the case, and do you have any products pending approval that wouldhave been made by the facility in Plainsboro? Thanks."

Let me just kind of remind you and remind everyone -- so, we received the 483 back in early Fall, late Summer. And on the calland also at the investor day, we went through the details, and specifically talked about that we were treating this as severe as if we were going toget a warning letter. And put a lot of the aggressive plans in place between facility updates, changes within structure, and such that we believecurrently with the warning letter that there really isn't a scope in the change of what the costs are to remediate. In fact, as I mentioned, we look at     what the observations are in the warning letter, and they match up well to the 483, which is aligned well with the plans that we already have inplace. Relative to what a warning letter means versus, say, a 483 as many of you know, PMA approvals are not approved until the warning letter is lifted.We don't have any major products planned as far as for PMA launches right now within the 2012 window tied to that facility. And again, this isspecifically tied to the 105 facility it doesn't affect other facilities. Secondly, and relative to that is certificates to foreign governments, those thatdon't have their own equivalent of an FDA that rely on FDA. FDA won't certify that.We believe that that impact is minimal at this point.We're goingthrough and assessing that to take a look at it.There is some details relative to if it's already approved or asking for a new CFG. But those are typicallythe two areas that would impact. 510k's are okay. And we will be able to continue shipping our existing products. Obviously, we're treating this very aggressively. We want to beable to get all of these items addressed, and have the FDA come back in and inspect us and give us a clean bill of health."

So, are the current remediation post that, so now you're feeling likewhat you're doing is going to satisfy FDA, particularly after they talked about some not being adequate in some of your responses?"
28,18595945,INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORP,01/06/2012,1:30PM,IART,Integra LifeSciences Corporation Conference Call To Discuss PreliminaryQ4 2011 Financial Results,Peter Arduini,Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp,CEO,True,False,False,"Steven, it's Pete. Good question. I think, as all of you get a chance to look at the warning letter, comments on September responses and things ofthat nature, and as we had told you actually in early November, we had done quite a bit of work month by month. And so the Agency has had achance to see some of that.The warning letter from our view potentially doesn't incorporate all of that change that we had put in place. So, simpleexample would be, at the time of that response, the new roof for the whole facility wasn't completed that's completed now, as an example. So yes, we have advanced a lot of the different changes within the overall facility, and we believe that we've made substantial changes since theinitial component of that. That being said, we have to prove to the FDA that all of those are adequate, that we're in compliance, but we've beenaggressively working towards that plan. And again, one of the key points that we talked about, we talked about structure changes and things ofthat nature, and we would have those completed by December, and have the clean rooms throughout the facility all up and running. That wasachieved on plan, and we are back up and running."

I mean we just -- we personally just received the letter not that long ago, even though the letter was actuallydated on the 21st.

Well, not a couple we'll call it one. First, it's unclear to me if theongoing expenses on the quality control initiatives resulting from the 483 and the warning letter are in your non-GAAP earnings, or if those arestripped out of the non-GAAP earnings? And then related to that, seems rational to me that you would need to front load a bit to capital expenditurespending into 2012 to address these issues, so it would seem like free cash flow per share should be well under earnings per share in 2012, butperhaps you could comment on that?"

One, we are excluding expenses for remediation and underabsorption in the 105 plan. So, in that sense, we are proposingto break those out, which puts the investor community in the position of analyzing our numbers how they see fit. We do believe that both theout-of-pocket expense component and the underabsorption component is a short-term item, and won't reflect the long-term performance of theCompany. So, we break it out, and exclude it from the adjusted EPS. The second item is -- with regard to CapEx, there had been capital expenditure, mostly in Q4, for remediation of that plan. There may have been alittle in Q3 already -- have to go back and look. We do not now anticipate substantial incremental CapEx for this purpose in that plan in Q1. There'salways ongoing, but the main [bolus], the new roof and the construction inside the plant happened all within Q4 and no, we don't have a brokenout, granular number on that yet. That's part of the results that we need to finalize, and we'll probably -- I'm sure we'll have that number if peoplewant it on the February call."

I think we've mentioned in the past that both of those, because of the level of integration that we've done, wefundamentally don't have separate entities anymore.

Right. Well, please don't blame me for trying. What I'm trying to figure out here is, as I look into 2012 and the revenue growth guidance thatyou've provided, by my estimate I'm thinking those acquisitions contribute somewhere on the order of incremental 4% or so, give or take. And so,that would mean that organic growth would be somewhere in that 4% range for 2012. And based on my math, I think revenues may have declinedyear over year on an organic basis as core. So, I just was hoping that you could take us through the businesses again to help us understand thebuilding blocks of how we get to positive organic revenue growth in 2012. Thank you."

Well, as far as your 2012 breakdown goes, Charles, at least at the consolidated level, it sounds like you're right on target. Of the growth thatwe forecast for 2012, about 0.5 will come from the full-year effect of the SeaSpine and Ascension acquisitions. And about 0.5 will come from, shallwe say, growth in the legacy business and so forth. And then we expect to have a negative headwind of about 1% from currency effect. So, that'ssort of the high level take on those numbers. Now, you might say, well, if you know how much is organic and how much is accretive -- or how much is incremental from the existing business,why don't we give the break-out? The answer is, they are estimates for the reasons Pete described, where it's a judgment call, the truth is -- theyare integrated businesses, sales reps make choices about what products to sell and what not. So, when we talk about next year, what we say is --look, those were existing businesses that had certain performance last year, and this is how you can kind of think about it, about 4% from thefull-year effect, about 4% from growth in legacy, and then take away about one all-in for currency effect, and that's about where we are."

On the Instruments side, yes, we believe that the Alternate Site underperformance this quarterwill resolve itself in the first half. We've actually seen this phenomenon before. And we saw a significant destocking in Alternate Site in the firstquarter of 2009. And it took about six months to sort of get fully back to normal. It seemed to be more rapid this time, and it may mean that it willrecover more quickly as a result. We do know from at-the-store sales data that our distributors continue to sell our products about as expected.So, we don't think we've lost any share. So, overall, we think that business is fundamentally sound. Now, as far as the end market assumptions go, we've made no dramatic assumptions about any of our end markets changing in any fundamentalway. We've seen a fair amount of pressure in Europe, especially in the countries that have become famous for having economic issues. But that's-- I'd say we made no heroic assumptions about market expansion changes, macro conditions or anything else. Just to remind the team, try to keep it to one question each."

And so we know that that end-userdata hasn't fundamentally changed, that's why we know we haven't lost share.

And so, we didn't have the same level of surge in that area. We had some good Disposablesresponse, so we don't see anything that says that there's any major changes there from that standpoint. As we look at Neuro in Asia, we commented that there was some certain areas with distributors based on timing and whatnot that they didn't takethe same level of product that they had normally taken from a standpoint of some of our capital equipment. But again, I don't see any majorlonger-term effects. We are watching Europe quite a bit, particularly with the austerity measures. As you know, many of the first things that get     focused on and reduced are the amount of capital expenditures.

So, can you just kind of reconcile what the issue is, and maybe when you look at 2012, what geographies willgrow? What may be flattish?"

So, I'll give a little bit of a level, and then Jack, you may want to comment a little bit as well. And I think you understood it well, I mean, whatcaused some of the changes in Q4 were as we highlighted in the comments relative to some of the product approvals and such. As we look forwardout into 2012, we're more cautious about our Europe overall expectations, clearly in what we're looking for in our guidance. Some of the markets,such as traditional markets, such as Japan versus, say, China, we may be not as expecting as much growth out as a mature market as Japan as wemight have six months ago. Latin America and some of the other markets, we see it still continuing actually aligned with our overall expectations.And then obviously there's the broader question of currency with the strengthening of the overall dollar.

And then on the Spine side, if you looked at it, at the business pro forma, assuming these acquisitions were fully in the numbers in the year-agoperiod, not surprisingly, it doesn't look like that business is growing, again, especially on the metal side. So, I guess my question is, how long doyou think it will take before you can realize the growth goals within that Spine division, especially on the hardware side that you had envisioned?And I ask the question just because historically when I look at the companies that have tried to build through acquisitions in Spine, like BioMedand Zimmer, the process of integration and getting everything settled out has taken a number of quarters, if not a well over a year before thingssettled out. So, within that context, I'm just curious as to your expectations for when and how you can get that business to grow the way you wantit to."

We take a look at it from a hardware and an Orthobiologic standpoint, two things. First of all, to the pointabout getting the distribution structure settled, working cross-pollination, we really crossed that chasm in 2011, and there was a significant amountof work that went into that. And we feel quite good about that structure. Just even, as you mentioned, the cross-pollination of products from onebusiness to the other to the distribution structure, the amount of capital outlay and how we've done that, I think we've done that responsibly andwe have a good structure in place.     That being said, the market is where the market is, and so part of our overall expectations for 2012 are to be a little bit cautious relative to theoverall growth that we think is going to be achieved in Orthopedics, and keeping in mind that the majority of our Spine business is heavily USweighted. As in the next few years, we're going to be growing outside. That being said, our Biologics portfolio, which really adds, I think, quite adifferentiator for us as other individual metal suppliers stand out there, is doing very nicely. And between our demineralized bone products, ourmosaic product, and the expansion of distributors that we've been able to bring into it, we see that as a major component of our growth for Spinereally in 2012. And really our hope and strategy, which hasn't changed, is bringing those two together that we can bring differentiated value. Allthat being said though, we've tempered some of our overall expectations in 2012 just based on how we see the market. Jack, I don't know if you would like to add any other comments?"

Inthe case of this SeaSpine acquisition for us, there was very little overlap, and so we've had a few places with sort of fights at the borderlands, butin general, it hasn't required the same kind of distributor bloodbath that you often get when you see a big company acquire a smaller Spinecompany."

I just had a question on -- I know you talked about the miss really came from the last three weeks in thequarter, but can you just talk about that level of deterioration? I mean, it's pretty significant when it moves your EPS that much below guidancefor the quarter, so I was just curious about that could you add more color on that?"

On the top line, the point aboutthe surprise versus our internal expectations, if you will, the speed of the deterioration came from really these three points we've identified. Half,or actually a bit more than half came from Instruments, and almost all of that was Alternate Site. That was actually a few, call it, rifle shot decisionsby big companies that we do business with. We could have -- in some circumstances, probably given away economics and gotten some of thoserevenues, and we made a decision not to do that. So, that was a pretty quick shortfall. The second impact, about a 0.25 of our internal disappointment was on international, and that was in, again, a few specific locations. Also somesystematic stuff in Europe, but a few specific locations. And the third was Extremity's, which we've talked about at length on this call. So, that wasthe top line hit. Then as far as the adjusted EPS is concerned, there are people who have actually emailed in questions saying -- well, it seems that the range forthat is a little low given the top line miss, that there ought to have been some effect. And that's straightforward math. We are mindful of the factthat at this very early stage in our financial reporting, to be very direct, there's a whole bunch of stuff we have to finish doing, ranging from a lot     of the end of the year testing, to the tax rate and so forth. And so we are being careful there. That follows a quarter in which, on the one hand, wehad a tremendous amount going on, the Ascension integration, the remediation work, and a number of other initiatives. And at the same time,we were focusing hard on expenses because obviously once you move past Thanksgiving, we begin to see that it was not shaping up into at leastan excellent quarter. So, Pete, I don't know if you want to elaborate on some of that, but that's how we think of all of that."

Obviously we've been taking a hard look at our broader expenses we'll continue to do so. I think from a strategystandpoint, we'll talk more about that and some of our focus areas actually next week with different investors and analysts. I think just to reinforceJack's point on the quarter, the surprise piece, our Instruments business is half Alt Site, half Acute Care -- Acute Care with Spine. Alt Site, to giveyou some relative statistics, 30% of the year in the last few years has come in the fourth quarter, and a vast majority of that comes from distributorsmaking buys really in the last three to four weeks. That didn't happen. That's what really caused the surprise. Now one may ask themselves -- gee,is you're forecasting structure as adequate as it should be to see that?

One, the Orthobiologics business is done particularly well, that's part of it.That may be the area where we have the greatest edge. So, that'sfully part of that business. Secondly, the mission of our Spine business is certainly to grow faster than the market. Now, whether that's fast enough, or what that translatesto is partly a function of the argument you have over what's happening in the market. But it is certainly the objective of that group to grow fasterthan the market, and they are seeing that the cross-pollinization of these products are -- it's attractive to the dealers involved. So, we are optimisticthat we can hold our own and do better, but that's not by any means a foregone conclusion."

We had two separate distribution teams that had two separate productlines, both of those product lines weren't fully adequate to meet all of the needs, even in the surgeons that we're calling on, so they went to otherproducts. We're already seeing, as we get the products cross-pollinated, that we're picking up procedural growth with our current surgeons justbecause we can fill out the products that we have. Obviously on a go-forward basis, beyond that, picking up new surgeons and growing beyondthat is what we need to be able to prove to ourselves and show that we can grow and take share more broadly. But that's how we kind of take alook at the share growth in 2012. And the fact that we have our distribution structure settled, as well as our cross-pollination of our products wellon their way, gives us confidence in that area."
