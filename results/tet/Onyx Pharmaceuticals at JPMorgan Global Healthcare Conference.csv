1,18609080,ONYX PHARMACEUTICALS,01/09/2012,5:30PM,ONXX,Onyx Pharmaceuticals at JPMorgan Global Healthcare Conference,Tony Coles,"Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","President, CEO",False,True,False,"Thanks, Cory and good morning, everyone.Today's conversation is going to include forward-looking statements, and I will refer you to our variousSEC filings for additional details about the presentation. I actually want to tell you a story, and -- tell you a story, and unlike many stories that have a beginning, a middle, and an end, this is a story that hasa beginning, a middle, and a future. If I were going to use the method it would be -- once upon a time there was a tiny company that had oneproduct, maybe half a product, and that would describe Onyx 1.0. Nexavar just approved in liver and kidney cancers at the end of 2005 and 2007,respectively, and it formed the basis for this tremendous engine for growth and opportunity that we now today call Onyx. In its current iteration, Onyx 2.0, Nexavar continues to grow globally. There are sales that are growing and advancing in liver cancer around theworld and importantly in the Asia-Pacific regions, where year over year we experienced approximately 27% growth in that critical region of themarket that represents the greatest demographic opportunity for liver cancer. And now, new to the story, new to Onyx 2.0 and its second iteration or its second chapter are a set of franchises that we are proud to call our own.On the horizon, Onyx 3.0, the next evolution for the Company. And not very far away, because as you think about 2011 -- and we appreciate Cory's kind words -- 2011 really was a pivotal and a remarkable yearfor the Company. The strength of news flow, the strength of significant strategic achievements have positioned the Company in several criticalareas. Importantly, advancing carfilzomib expanding the portfolio and as I have mentioned already, continuing to grow Nexavar, which nowentering its sixth year of commercialization continues to be the core for the growth for our Company. For carfilzomib we expanded the data set across treatment settings with something for everyone. In the frontline, the relapse setting, and importantlyin the relapsed and refractory setting, where critical treatments are needed and necessary for patients who today don't have any good alternatives. Starting the globalization of our efforts with clinical testing in Japan through our partners in Japan, Ono, as well as the expansion of our commercialinfrastructure and business infrastructure in Europe with headquarters now in Switzerland and regulatory headquarters in London marks theglobalization of Onyx as we enter this new phase or new chapter of our story. And then finally submitting the New Drug Application for review bythe FDA with an expected decision date in the middle of this year.     So how do we put all of this together? We started with a once-upon-a-time, a tiny company with half of a product. Our goal very simply and ourmission is to make a difference in the lives of patients. It is why I get up every morning, and it is the only expression of value that we know will bringlasting shareholder value and lasting benefit to patients around the world. This year the critical news flow, the strength of our balance sheet with over $600 million in cash, the opportunities for a near-term registration forcarfilzomib, and then on the horizon new indication opportunities for Nexavar, for carfilzomib, for the rest of the proteasome inhibitor franchisesuggest that Onyx is well on its way to defining its next chapter. So if I were to close and invite you on the continuation of this great journey thatwe have started, help us write the story for a Company that has all the potential to do a lot of good. Thank you very much."
