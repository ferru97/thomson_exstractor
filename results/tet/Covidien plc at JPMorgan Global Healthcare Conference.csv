I am going to take the next 25 minutes to cover several topics I think will be of great importance to you today. I would like beforewe start to go over the forward-looking statements, if you read them. We are going to be talking about the changing market dynamics. We get asked a lot of questions about pressure in terms of volume, in terms ofprice. We are going to talk a little bit about that, and how Covidien is going to deal with that in terms of long-term perspective for growth, top lineand also bottom line. Go back and look at some of the performance that Covidien has demonstrated in the last four years, as well is what will be the growth drivers soCovidien can continue to deliver sales and OI above market. The changing market dynamics, the tailwinds are pretty clear.We still have the need for healthcare across the globe.You look at emerging markets. I was recently in Brazil about three weeks ago, and the ascension of the middle class is unbelievable. And the need for healthcare is ever -- has notbeen so high in the 23, 25 years since I left the country. You look at the demographics across the globe, the aging populations. So all the demographics are there, and so the demand for medical devicesare still in place. What concerns us is that there is a significant change in terms of market growth rate in some of the developed markets like the US and Europe.Wesee that happen in the last 12 to 18 months. We also see a shift in the dynamics between what used to be a volume-driven business to a value-driven business. That is key for us in terms of --when we look forward, where Covidien put its monies and where we put our focus will be in the areas that will bring that value instead of bringingonly the volume. And lastly the environmental aspects of the regulatory aspects in all countries are being scrutinized in a much higher level. We always think thereis a great opportunity and we invest significantly in emerging markets but there are significant barriers to entry there as well. Not only in China,but Brazil as well, places like India. So you have got to be able to have an organization that can cope with that. These are the changes that concerns us, and we are adapting theCompany to continue to thrive in this environment.     So I would like to close today by talking to you specifically about what are the growth drivers. Why am I sitting up here today, standing up here infront of you and telling you that our underlying organic growth for the business is solid? They're areas that I am very confident that we will continueto execute. We had a tremendous turnaround in Pharmaceuticals in 2011. That business has done well. There were poised for in 2012 to deliver solid growth. Our endomechanical franchise continued to gain market share. Our Tri-Staple product within endomechanical is doing quite well, as well as ourenergy base. And the neurovascular division is doing extremely well with very high growth. We are going to continue to allocate resources. As I said, we will take from businesses which we don't think have growth potential we are goingto turn that to businesses that have higher potential. And why do I underscore that so much? Because in 2007 when we became a public company, we had a value proposition to you and we said wewere going to increase R&D. We gave a shot to almost all businesses, with the exception of a few. Today Covidien has a more sophisticated portfolio management capability and is drilling specifically in businesses and white spaces that havehigher potential to deliver top-line growth. We do understand the ROIC is highly important to the shareholders, and we are focused on that as wecontinue to trend then the right direction. We do understand that top-line growth is what creates the most amount of value. We understand that R&D is the biggest vehicle for deliveringvalue to our shareholders. We have the capital flexibility in the Company to support our growth. We generate close to $2 billion in free cash flow. We are going to continueto use that in our advantage. If we don't find the acquisitions, if we don't find the right opportunities we will deliver that cash back to the shareholders. And we have proventhat we can do that. We have a proven management team that understands how to create shareholder value. And we have above all one of the best teams in healthcare.We have a great bench. In 2007 we had to hire a lot of people from the outside to bring this Company to what it is today. But today I stand up here and say that we havea phenomenal team that can deliver on the top-line growth and the OI that we have promised investors. And the bench is deep. So with that I would like to conclude our presentation, and I think we have Q&A across the hall."
