2,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Thank you, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to announce that we have entered into an agreement to acquire TaxACT, a leadingprovider of online tax solutions.The purpose of today's call is to introduce TaxACT, briefly discuss their market opportunity and favorable positioningand highlight why we believe this is an attractive opportunity for shareholders. I'll start by reviewing our summary messages regarding this transaction. Our CFO, Eric Emans, will then cover some of the key financial aspects ofthe deal. I will provide a few closing remarks and then we will open the call for your questions. T he TaxACT leadership team is not on the call today given the demands of peak tax season but I look forward to introducing TaxACT President,JoAnn Kintzel, at a later date to discuss her business in more detail. Before I get into any specifics, I want to underscore that this is a significant milestone for our Company. As many of you know, capital allocationhas been a key focus of ours for some time. During my 13 months as CEO, our team has evaluated numerous acquisition opportunities and wefound an outstanding business in TaxACT with a strong consumer brand and a growing market run by a fantastic team with an excellent trackrecord of execution and financial performance. This transaction aligns with our capital deployment objectives and positions us well going forward. I couldn't be more enthusiastic about theopportunities this combination will create for our shareholders, for the TaxACT team, and for InfoSpace employees. Let me quickly review some of the key highlights. Under the terms of the agreement we are acquiring TaxACT for $287.5 million in cash. Thisrepresents approximately 7.6 times trailing adjusted EBITDA. TaxACT has an impressive financial profile. As Eric will discuss in more detail, the transaction represents an attractive return on shareholder capital.We are anticipating debt financing in connection with this acquisition and following close, we expect to have an excess of $90 million in cash andequivalents on hand. The transaction should close in the first quarter following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatoryapprovals. The benefits of this combination both from a business and financial perspective are compelling and clear. First,TaxACT operates in a strong marketin the early stages of a digital transition, not unlike digital migrations underway in other consumer markets, travel, brokerage, banking, real estateand shopping, to name a few. The travel industry, for example, was one of the earliest to go online thanks to the widespread adoption of eTickets.Today the vast majority of airline tickets are sold online through agencies and supplier websites. Similar shifts are underway in tax preparation where government adoption and consumer behavior are driving online growth. Since 2000, the USgovernment has expanded access to electronic filing and faster refunds. IRS e-File has grown at double-digit annual rates from tax year 2000 totax year 2010. On the consumer side, filers are moving online as familiarity sets in, security concerns abate, and enhanced product offerings make it easier andquicker to do your taxes online than alternative methods of preparation. Second, we like the TaxACT competitive position. They have an established brand and a well-earned reputation for delivering value to consumersover the years. Third, TaxACT has a successful track record of great execution driven by a top-flight management team with decades of experience providingconsumer tax preparation solutions. And finally, the pro forma financial profile is compelling and offers strong and near-term return on shareholdercapital. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the strategic rationale in more detail.The tax preparation market is large and undergoing a long-termsecular shift toward online, do-it-yourself preparation. Computer aided do-it-yourself tax preparation is supplementing paper and pencil as well     The company has an expanding presence in social channels online and a mobile offering that now enables its consumers to extend their relationshipwith the brand wherever they go. We have been impressed with the company's overall marketing capabilities and knowhow at TaxACT and lookforward to underwriting their team and investments in this area going forward. TaxACT financial performance largely speaks for itself. It is a testament to the team that they have accomplished so much while maintaining profitdisciplines and preserving capacity for further investment.We look forward to working with the management team at TaxACT to evaluate for areasfor future investment and opportunistic expansion. In addition to TaxACT being a great business, I also believe this transaction represents compelling return on capital to our shareholders. I would now like to turn the call over to Eric Emans to discuss the key financial benefits of the acquisition. Eric?"
3,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Eric Emans,InfoSpace,CFO,False,True,False,"Thanks, Bill. Let's start by taking a look at what this transaction represents in terms of return on shareholder capital. To illustrate, TaxACT leveredfree cash flow for the 12 months ending September 30, 2011 was $32.2 million. Factoring the $200 million cash investment, the return on equityis approximately 16% for the transaction, (technical difficulty) transaction that contemplates modest leverage. We project return on equity will grow in 2012 and beyond. It is worth noting the cash tax savings from the utilization of InfoSpace's NOL significantlyimproves the return on equity by approximately 50% on a pro forma basis. Now let's take a look at the pro forma financial profile of the combined companies. As Bill mentioned, the acquisition is immediately accretive to earnings per share. For the 12 months ending September 30, 2011,TaxACT generatedrevenues of $78.1 million and adjusted EBITDA of $37.8 million. On a pro forma basis,TaxACT's non-GAAP net income for the 12 months ending September 30, 2011 was $31.8 million, or $0.85 per diluted InfoSpaceshare, which includes a reduction for imputed interest expense related to the debt financing, the $4.5 million or $0.12 per diluted InfoSpace share. As a reminder, non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash income tax expense related to our expected utilization of our NOL's which providesenhanced value to InfoSpace shareholders. Shifting to the combined results, for the 12 months ending September 30, 2011, the combined entity would have generated pro forma revenueof $290 million, pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $72.5 million and pro forma non-GAAP net income of $45.6 million or $1.21 per diluted share. Finally, TaxACT generates substantial free cash flow and following the completion of the transaction, we will maintain a strong balance sheet withcash in excess of $90 million that will afford us the opportunity to invest in the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks."

So to sum it up, we are excited about this next step in the evolution of our Company. Our search business is operating well and exits2011 with a lot of momentum. With TaxACT, we have added a great business and team to the mix confronting a growing market with a leadingproduct and a strong following. This transaction represents attractive return for our shareholders and the combined company is well positioned for future growth, investment andvalue creation.     Thanks for joining us this morning and we have a limited time set aside now to address any questions from the group. With that, I will open it upto your questions."

6,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Clay Moran,The Benchmark Company,Analyst,True,False,False,"Good morning. A couple of things. Could you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape where TaxACT fits in, what the barriers to entry are?And seems like TaxSlayer may be somewhat new to the market, what do they represent in terms of a competitive threat? Secondly, just any change to management that is considered at this point -- TaxACT management, are they all staying on and what's their incentiveto stay?"
7,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,"Yes, thanks, Clay. So the tax preparation market is -- consists of established providers, names you have heard of over time, H&R Block, and otheroff-line typically historically off-line paid professionals who prepare.The market is roughly 60% today on the side of professionals and paid preparersand then about 40% what's called do-it-yourself, which historically has been pen and paper, more recently has been desktop software and evenmore recently has been online. And the dynamics are not unlike dynamics, Clay, as I mentioned in my comments, that you see in other consumer segments where just online isan easier way to do it. And there are some hurdles you've got to get over as it relates to the perceived complexities of tax preparation and someof the consumer inhibitions around using an online service to do something like tax preparation. But nevertheless, that shift is underway. It's one that we recognize from other consumer verticals. The competitive landscape as it relates to the do-it-yourself includes Intuit, which is a large and respected player in the space H&R Block is alsoonline with an online solution TaxACT is a leader as we have talked about. You mentioned TaxSlayer, there's a couple of other players that wouldI think probably properly be put in the value segment within the online landscape. And I would say the barriers to entry principally, Clay, are really around the product and the domain expertise of providing consumers with an easyway to do their taxes in an online format. That is -- as simple as that may seem to say, it's a very sophisticated offering and capability that TaxACThas developed over a decade and prior to that at a different company. And the translation of what can be a rather complicated and confusing set of rules and procedures as they might apply to an individual as theyprogress through life, translating that into an interview style product offering that gets people comfortable with doing such an important thingonline is actually a nontrivial thing and really deeply resides in product and understanding of the tax code and translating that into somethingfrom a consumer interface standpoint that is intuitive and comfortable. So it really is just I think it has a lot to do with domain expertise, which is not uncommon for an industry like this."
8,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Clay Moran,The Benchmark Company,Analyst,True,False,False,One follow up there before you move on to the management. Any plans at all to alter the strategy and/or just enhance the marketing given thatInfoSpace is traditionally an online marketing Company? Are there any tweaks to what they're doing that you feel you can help the current situation?
9,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,"Well, certainly we are optimistic that we can help and enable what the TaxACT team is doing.We really do like the strategy they have been pursuing.I would say from a fit standpoint it lines up very well. We see a lot of cultural alignment between our two companies at the core. We really do feellike there is the beginnings of a great relationship with the team in Cedar Rapids. So I would say that is probably one of the best combination effectsright off the bat. The second is we are both online companies and that's just through the DNA of both companies knowing what it means to own and operate awebsite, the importance of keeping that website up to date, the importance of uptime and reliability, the importance of security, all the aspectsaround being an online presence. And then the aspects with respect to product development and consumer marketing -- and I know you mentioned marketing in particularly, thoseare two fundamental undertakings of the company of TaxACT that we think they're quite good at. We have been impressed by them in both ofthose realms and to the extent that we can help, we're absolutely prepared to do that and do so in a collaborative way. And as you can probably guess from the trended results of the company, the good news is that there's nothing broken at the moment so they'rehumming along and we have lots of discussions under way as to how we can help them. I think, Clay, you had also asked a question about retention. And so the management team is sticking around, we have discussed roles with theteam there that are unaltered. As I had mentioned in my introductory remarks, the team was one of the real attractive points for us in pursuing thiscombination. So we have as you might imagine, discussions and resolution as it relates to roles and responsibilities after this transaction."

11,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,Thanks a lot.
12,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Operator,NA,NA,True,False,False,"Kartik Mehta, Northcoast Research."
13,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Kartik Mehta,Northcoast Reasearch,Analyst,True,False,False,"Good morning. I was wondering, you gave some numbers as to what you thought the online market was growing and then you also talked abouthow well TaxACT was growing. And I'm wondering for the upcoming tax season, would you expect to grow in line with what you thought theonline market was growing or is TaxACT in a position where you think you can grow faster?"
14,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,"Well, certainly it would be our expectation to grow in line with the market. It's early to speak to the 2011 tax year season as were really just gettingunderway, as you know. But the company is excited about the plans it has in place. It has in the course of this year unlike -- not unlike prior years, learned a lot of things as it relates to the market and how it developed in calendaryear 2010, tax year 2010. Applied those learnings into its product, applied those learnings into its marketing, thoughts around marketing budgetand marketing mix and timing of its marketing spend. And so I think that they are very well positioned to have a good year and certainly it'severybody's expectation that they will grow with the market. One thing I would say is that historically the growth formula is very logically a function of getting consumers to come to the site, getting those thathave worked with you in the past to revisit and reuse your product and then also making sure that they are making it -- they have available to thema variety of offerings, some of which will be paid and that they make full use of those so that that can go to conversion within the funnel. And allof those levers are being pursued. I think from a pricing standpoint, the company has not historically taken aggressive pricing year on year. Price and value and affordability arefundamental to its core message to consumers. And so I think that is a lever that they'll use more judiciously than it simply will be trying to driveyear on year revenue growth through pricing action. But to your core question as it relates to the unit volumes, certainly they are expecting to grow with the market."
15,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Kartik Mehta,Northcoast Reasearch,Analyst,True,False,False,"And so as I look at the numbers you presented in your presentation, obviously TaxACT grew revenue fairly well from FY '10 to FY '11. Would thatimply that the corresponding customers grew in the same manner concerning your statement that they have not used pricing really?"
16,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,"Right. So for the most part, but not exactly. So the other determinant there as it relates to revenue growth is going to be mix. So three to the extentthat you had a constant mix from year to year, I think the answer to your question would be yes. But to the extent that you have an evolved mixas it relates to paid versus nonpaid consumers and then on the paying consumers, what is the revenue per consumer as i.e., the attach rate aroundpaid offerings? So there are differences, as you know, from year to year as it relates to that."
17,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Kartik Mehta,Northcoast Reasearch,Analyst,True,False,False,"I just want to make sure I understood the statement you said. So would it be fair to say that TaxACT will be more -- will be a little bit more aggressivein how it prices its product, it has maybe more pricing power than the companies used in the past so now they'll have more opportunity to usepricing as a way to grow?"
18,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,"Well I think I was speaking to their historical practice which historically that has not been -- that is a lever that many providers in the marketplaceand anybody naturally offering something that consumers might use.     I think however that the deliberation that goes on within the TaxACT team as to how and when they take pricing, those types of topics are givena lot of thought because fundamentally one of the reasons why the following is as strong as it is is that it has a well-earned reputation for being avalue provider, a provider of value, it's got a great product and it's also offered on great terms. And so care will be given as it relates to pricing decisions to make sure that they don't run awry of that relationship with their consumers. So wasless offering a view into the future."

Any thoughts about further consolidating the industry as there are some other smaller players in the market thatdo online?
20,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,"Yes. So consolidation in the space has certainly been discussed. I think there -- in certain cases there would be advantages in combining, in TaxACT'scase and InfoSpace and TaxACT's case with another player in the market. I think we would want to give some thought to what the expandedpresence might be with consumers as it relates to the brands and what they signify. To the extent those brands were entirely overlapping, I thinkthe question would then go to more raw back-end economics and the advantages of bringing two businesses together. But it is certainly somethingthat is a possibility in the foreground."

Just going back to your description of the services, products and services that they currently offer, you talked about their -- it's do-it-yourselfbut there's a combination of desktop software as well as the online. What is the current revenue mix between the two?"

So right now, it's primarily driven by the online product, the desktop is declining over time as you would expect those users toshift to online. So I would say about 70 -- over 70% of revenues coming from the online and desktop is at about 8% for tax year 2010."

What is the next thing that consumersbuy? Is it a state online or is it some kind of -- what's the upgrade past?"
33,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,"That's right, Eric, this is Bill. So that is absolutely right. The company has over the years been steadfast in offering and really the first in offering freefederal filings, which as you can imagine is of great interest to a good swath of the market.Those consumers that are residing in states where theirstate income tax, that is an upsell to provide that and the company has a product that addresses all the states there. And there is another -- there are other upgrades as it relates to that rate card and the pricing sheet with respect to the types of services that Erichad mentioned. There is a degree of stickiness as it relates to a consumer that enters in the first year whether they are filing federal or federal andstate as it relates to their information. And so the ability to access that information for retrieval purposes as it relates to future tax periods, for initiating your taxes in the coming year isof great value and that is an example that is referred to as data archive service that the company offers, which would be an example of a paidproduct above and beyond state. And then there are a variety of financial services including refund payment transfers, Stored Value Card solutions that offer consumers flexibilityas it relates to the receipt of refunds and what they do with those refunds and how they are processed. Support is another important -- another element of their service, Eric, and consumers that are looking for more hand holding and walk-throughs,they perceive complexity of their filings as such that they want to get on the phone with somebody that is offered by the company as well."

You said 40% of the market is electronic. What percent of that market is TaxACT?"
40,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,"Good morning, Rich, this is Bill. I think and it is important from a market definition standpoint to walk through it a little bit. To be more specific,40% is what we call do-it-yourself and do-it-yourself historically has been pen and paper, people just don't want to pay a storefront provider to dotheir taxes, their taxes are simple or they're at a level of comfort and sophistication where they are happy doing it on their own. And that particular segment has been undergoing a pretty radical shift over the last 15 years, which is the initial alternative method that wasintroduced was more of a CD-ROM desktop type offering where consumers could move away from pen and paper. And then more recently whichhas now been going on for some time has been the online capability, which is replacing not only pen and paper but also now desktop. But that 40%, which is the do-it-yourself, that is the segment that really refers to that subset of the filing population that is comfortable whetherit's just -- they just prefer to do it on their own, they have privacy concerns, they have a perfect level of sophistication and comfort doing it on theirown. But that's what we refer to as do-it-yourself. The subset of do-it-yourself, which is referred to as digital do-it-yourself is 33% of the market.The numbers are not super precise as it relates to thesources but rough order of magnitude 140, 142 million filers in the US, 40% of which are in the do-it-yourself category through whatever meansand 33% of overall filers are in the digital do-it-yourself which includes both software and online. And then the online portion is 20% which is wherewe came up with the 30 million filers out of the 140 million."

Second question is what are the regulatory and legal events which are likely to influence the business over the next six to 18 months? I guessthis is an industry that's in some degree influenced by changes in the tax law. And how do you kind of look at that?
42,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,"It has historically been influenced by tax law. I think one of the real drivers of the opportunity we see in the digital online market is the -- is reallyaided by the US government in terms of its initiatives around the Free File Alliance, which was in the early 2000s teeming with industry participantsto make it easy for individuals with incomes below $57,000 a year to file electronically which has been a real catalyst. And also provides a lot ofclarity with folks as to the dates of the filing and creates a rather regimented calendar year in, year out. To the extent that there is simplification on the horizon, this is a difficult thing for anybody to crystal ball, but to the extent that the tax codesimplifies then you might imagine that consumers' perception of the complexity of their own filings will decrease which I think as well would bea catalyst to the reception of online and the migration toward online. So we would certainly see that as being a tailwind to the extent it happens but that's a difficult thing to speak to."

CapEx, what is the CapEx of this business? How is that going to integrate with your own CapEx?And I guess we can ask the same question of non-cash executive compensation?"

Bill, obviously since you've been leading the Company, I think alot of people have been anticipating a transaction like this. However -- and of course the fact that you have spoken to it in generality would be oneof the reasons why. I'm wondering if you could explain to us a little bit about how you decided on this company as opposed to one that might have been within theconstruct of what you and we might have considered related adjacencies? I think one of the big questions about this transaction as much as itseems appealing on some levels is it doesn't seem to have a lot to do with your core business right now. And the second question I have is somewhat related, which is the prior proposed transaction between H&R Block and TaxACT, not coincidentlyseemed to be for about the same amount of money. So I'm wondering how you came to the sum and did your valuation analysis? Thanks."
56,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,"Yes, sure, thanks, Scott. Yes, it's very, very reminiscent of that price so I will let let you arrive at your own conclusions as to how it is we arrrived atthat valuation. It was negotiated outcome as you might imagine as these things typically are. And there was a degree of opportunism on our partas it relates to pursuing this opportunity. So one of the things that I think we have spoken about in prior calls has been as it relates to the successfulness of our acquisition effort, makingsure that we have the right resources in place, making sure that we have the right criteria established that best map to our opportunity and wherewe think we can be successful and then also a degree of opportunism which is finding the right situation and making sure that we act with urgencyin pursuit of an opportunity. And this is I think straight down the fairway as it relates to those attributes that the idea of moving into an adjacent category that would be moredirectly complementary of search was certainly something that was in the consideration set. And so by virtue of this announcement, one shouldnot assume that those types of opportunities weren't evaluated. This was one that was head and shoulders from our perspective more attractive, from a market opportunity perspective, from our ability to influencethe outcome of what the company is doing. And that may be through means of the catalyst of new ownership and adopting a philosophy ofinvestment and resourcing and things that we're all very much stand at the ready to do with this business. But also in terms of cultural fit. We like the team, we think the team is doing really great things from their headquarters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa andwe look forward to enabling them. And so I think that's the -- that's really the way to answer that question. If you have any sort of more specific questions related to that, I'm happyto answer them."
57,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Scott Kessler,Standard & Poors,Analyst,True,False,False,"I guess one of the things that I know I'm thinking about is you look at the order of what transpired, clearly you guys have been looking for ameaningful larger transaction for some time clearly in I guess -- what, the fall of last year, the deal with H&R Block fell apart. So it provided you guyswith an opportunity. And I think that is something that you should be applauded for. But I guess what I'm wondering is, is it just that you didn't find what you wanted to find potentially in those adjacencies or was it a valuation issueor is it just that this opportunity arose and it was so compelling you had to move forward with it?"
58,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,"Well, I think that's a good question, I think by definition because we didn't announce anything in an adjacent space, we didn't find anything weliked. There were plenty of things that we've looked at. I mean I think we've gone into some detail on prior calls as it relates to the exhaustivenessof our effort and I think price has been an issue, Scott. So we have turned over a lot of rocks and there are a lot of great companies out there, thereare a lot of great companies that think they are worth on a multiple basis 15 to 20 times EBITDA and so it's difficult to reconcile in those conversations. And so I think the alignment that we feel as it relates to this company is kind of the points I had walked through the before as it relates to it beingan online company, the DNA is very similar to the DNA at this Company.TaxACT has what I would characterize as a maniacal focus on the consumer,which is they have built relationships with over five million filers over the course of their 13-year operating history that is really quite astoundingand speaks to their attention to product detail and attention to maintaining relationships beyond an initial tax season. And it's those types of attributes that as we think about the investment criteria and where we thought we would be most successful allocating ourcapital, that was absolutely one of those attributes which probably falls under the broader heading of just a really good company. And the factthat it's an online company and one that we think we're -- we understand and are positioned to help I think only adds to the rationale."

And the last question I had, just a really quick one if I may, any synergies you guys see on the revenue or on the cost side?"
60,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,"So I think that there likely will be synergies. My sense is that we're not coming at this from a cost rationalization standpoint in the slightest. As I hadmentioned, we may even on a more likely case see opportunities to invest together where we haven't before. And from a revenue standpoint, there are going to be opportunities for the InfoSpace search business to more prominently feature TaxACT throughthe course of our search results pages and our display inventory and we're going to take advantage of those as you might imagine and the next3.5 months is a good time to do it."

Good morning, congratulations. I will only ask one question. Marketing expenses, the company has what looks to be about a 45%operating margin. What are the marketing expenses in absolute terms maybe on a trailing 12? And how will you change the marketing strategyat this business going forward?"
65,18609071,"INFOSPACE, INC.",01/09/2012,1:30PM,INSP,InfoSpace Conference Call to Discuss Acquisition of TaxACT,Bill Ruckelshaus,InfoSpace,President and CEO,True,False,False,"Good morning, Ned, happy new year. So marketing expense as you might imagine is a significant piece of the company's SG&A.The spend is sufficeit to say, well over $25 million a year. You could piece that together by looking at the results. The historical practice has been not unlike other consumer acquisition efforts where it's a multichannel marketing effort online and off-line.There'sa lot of experimentation and a lot of processing of learnings from one year to the next. Much of the buying that goes on is bought ahead of timeas you might imagine, there's quite a lot of messaging in the marketplace this time of year between now and the end of tax season as it relates totax preparation. It's a seasonal business and in further communications, we are going to provide more detail as to the breakout of the business byquarter. But they have spent it in online and off-line channels and have had greater success in some areas than others, they spent a decent amount ofmoney in the search channel, which is an area where we spent a fair amount of time discussing and one we well understand.     And so I think that I personally have been impressed by the company's direct marketing capabilities and the brand that they have been able tobuild with the profit disciplines in place. So to the extent that we can work with the management team to continue that tradition and acceleratethat tradition, we see that as a real opportunity."
