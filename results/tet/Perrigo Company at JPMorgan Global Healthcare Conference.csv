1,18609261,PERRIGO CO.,01/09/2012,6:30PM,PRGO,Perrigo Company at JPMorgan Global Healthcare Conference,Joe Papa,Perrigo Company,"President, CEO and Chairman",False,True,False,"Thank you, Chris. It's a pleasure to be here today to talk about Perrigo. Perrigo is, this year, a 125-year-old Company. We're celebrating our 125thyear in business this year, but a Company that is not only 125 years old, but a Company that is poised for continued strong growth behind a coupleof key factors. Number one, just the move to what I would call quality, affordable healthcare and what we are doing in the store brand, private label space. Numbertwo, it is an increasing number of products that are moving from prescription to over-the-counter and our very strong position in the over-the-counterstore brand space, as more and more products go from prescription to OTC. Number three for us, clearly, it's going to be, in the past and certainly in the future, new products, new products, new products. We've had a greatsuccess in launching new products and we expect to continue to be able to launch new products going into the future. And finally, it's also a story that is involved with mergers and acquisitions. I'm delighted to say this morning for example, we just announced anacquisition of a smaller company, a bolt-on company in the diabetes space that's going to help us to continue to improve our offering in the storebrand private-label space for diabetes. So, let me move to the presentation. I refer you to our SEC filings for some of the risk statements that we have there relative to the Company andrefer you to the SEC filings. Let me move though to give you a broader sense of Perrigo. Perrigo predominantly is a Consumer Healthcare store brand private-label Company.Consumer Healthcare represents approximately 60%, 61% of our business.To that, we supplement it with the nutritional store brand opportunities.So, that's about another 18%. So, about 80% of our business is what I would call an over-the-counter and nutritional store brand private-labelbusiness where we make products for the Walgreens, the Wal-Marts, the CVS', the Rite Aids, Targets, Costco, you name it. We make a version of aproduct that offers the same quality, safety and effectiveness as the national brand, but a much better savings for the consumer and a much highermargin for the retailers. In addition to that, we have an Rx business, generic Rx business predominantly focused on what I would call extended topicals, generic prescriptions,think of things that are absorbed topically. So, dermatology, respiratory drugs absorbed topically through the lungs, nasal products absorbedtopically through the nasal mucosa as examples. And then finally, we have an active ingredient business that represents about 6% of the businessand that's where we make many of the active ingredients for other pharmaceutical companies around the world, but also for our own vertical     API, last area I'll talk about. Really, it's once again the active pharmaceutical business opportunity that -- it's not going to be the fastest growingpart of our business, but as you can see from the adjusted operating margin, it has had some significant improvement in adjusted operating marginbehind some of the things we've done. And really that is to focus in areas of this business where it is more difficult to make the API. So, think aboutdrugs that are -- have a different double bond configuration, think of steroidal products, think of cancer agents as all areas that we are focused onto ensure that we're going to be adding real value to our customers. So, that's been part of what we've been able to do in terms of driving the -- mostly the operating margins of the business. The other thing thisbusiness does for us, Perrigo to be clear, is that it helps us understand how much should we pay for raw material. Having that information is veryvaluable if our chemists can start with a raw material and say, going to this final active ingredient, you should be able to buy that for $400 a kilogram.And we know today, we're paying $700 a kilogram. That allows us to have a very strong negotiating position as we go out and talk to our currentsuppliers of the product. It is not our intent to make every raw material that we have, but clearly it puts us in a very good negotiating position weknow and understand how much these raw materials should cost us, starting at these raw materials and ending up at a finished active ingredient.So, it's very helpful for us in that sense of the business. Just to close -- in summation, where are we with our guidance? As I remind you, we are a July 1st fiscal year start.We did our initial earnings guidancein August with 15% to 18% topline growth. In October, we updated that guidance. We said, we indeed we think we'll grow faster, we'll grow 17%to 20%. And then you can see write-down through the adjusted consolidated gross margin of 35% to 38%, consolidated operating margin of 20%to 22%, estimated worldwide tax rate of between 27% to 29%. And we increased our diluted EPS from $4.50 to $4.65 to our October guidance of$4.65 to $4.80 between a 16% to 20% year-over-year growth rate and obviously, we improved our cash flow from operations. So, that's really the Perrigo story. We are excited about our future based on, as I started at the beginning, the move to store brand and continuedstrong move to store brand. The movement [of products] from prescription to OTC, also the success we've had in launching new products andfinally as we've been able to look for other organic and inorganic opportunities for growth. That concludes what I wanted to say at this time. There is a couple of minutes for additional questions. If I should open it up for questions, Chris?"

3,18609261,PERRIGO CO.,01/09/2012,6:30PM,PRGO,Perrigo Company at JPMorgan Global Healthcare Conference,Joe Papa,Perrigo Company,"President, CEO and Chairman",False,True,False,"Sure. Well, first of all, J&J has had some issues that they've been working on from the consumer products. And they have talked about re-enteringinto the liquid market in October, November, December of 2011. And they said, they would re-enter in the -- for a solid market in January, February,March of 2012 with a complete return sometime around mid-year 2012 at least is what I have heard from them [or as has been] shared with me. Ihave no reason to doubt that. I would say that the liquids at this time, they are not fully back, but they do have some products, but it is clear thatthey probably only have some of the products back at this time. They are not completely back at this time for example, on the Tylenol suspension. Novartis has said that they were going to stop shipping and recall some products. Those products represent somewhere around a brandedopportunity of about what appears to be about $200 million from the IMS data, but I don't have their internal data obviously. For us, knowing those products, knowing the discounts on those products, it probably represents somewhere in the $70 million to $100 millionstore brand opportunity for us if it was a full-year event. I don't know at this time whether it's a three-month event, a six-month or a year event orbeyond. So, what we will do is clearly, we'll go out and talk to our retailers, in fact we already have.There are some opportunities for us to get someincremental commitments from the retailers for additional product, but as to the duration of this at this time, it's probably too early for me to makeany comment on how long it would be a duration.     From our point of view, we'll take a quarter at a time in terms of how we look at the business opportunity, but clearly, we've got capacity, we areable to ship additional products should the retailers need that product."
