Welcome to the 30th Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference here in San Francisco. We should all have a few very interesting days ahead of us, and I believe this is actually one of the largest conferences we have ever hosted, with7,600 registered participants. That's about 10% by more than we had last year, which will require a bit of discipline amongst all of us in terms ofour behavior in the aisles and mobile phone usage and things like that, so thanks for your cooperation here. I am Alexandra Hauber, European pharmaceutical analyst at JPMorgan, and I am very pleased to introduce now the first speaker this morning inthe Colonial Room, Mr. Joe Jimenez, CEO of Novartis. He will be giving a presentation for 25 minutes, and then be available for your questionsacross the hall in the Georgia Room in a breakout session. Joe, thank you very much for being here today. The floor is yours."

I think there's no better place than the Bay Area to talk about innovation, and today what I would like to do is talk abouthow Novartis is changing the game in healthcare. But I want to do it in the context of the Novartis strategy and talking about how we leveragewhat we call focused diversification. And then I want to talk a little bit about the future and why I believe that Novartis is one of the best positionedhealthcare companies for the next 10 years. Now, it's no surprise everybody knows that the healthcare landscape is changing rapidly and it's changing dramatically. By the year 2020, therewill be over 700 million people who are over the age of 65, and we all know how that correlates very closely with demand for healthcare. At thesame time there will be more than 3 billion people on earth who are clinically obese, and all of the comorbidities that go with obesity. But if you just forget about the trends for a second and look at where we stand today, there is still huge unmet medical need in the world today.For example in China there are over 900,000 people who need to be treated for cataracts, so cataract surgery, that don't have access to medicines.In the US almost 75% of the total healthcare budget is spent on managing chronic disease. So there is a high level of unmet medical need, and trends suggest this is going to continue. So we are in a growth industry, and it's going to remaina growth industry. The segments in which Novartis competes we project will grow between 5% and 6% per year for the next five years. But the issue is healthcare costs. Healthcare costs have increased as a percent of GDP for 50 years. Everybody continues to say they don't see howthis is going to continue but if you look at trends and you look at history, it most likely is going to continue. So the question is -- who is going to win in this environment? I believe that the companies that are going to win are companies that are part of thesolution -- part of the solution on the cost side and also part of the solution on the innovation side to address unmet medical need. At Novartis, we have shaped our portfolio to be part of the solution in this new healthcare reality. So for example, we have a very large genericsdivision. If you look at our launch of enoxaparin in the US, which is generic Lovenox, we saved the US healthcare system over $700 million last year     We are going to announce our full-year results on January 25, so I cannot provide an outlook today but we will be providing a full summary of our2011 results webcast on January 26. And I will also talk about how we are moving through the Diovan patent expiration with this portfolio in a waythat I think may surprise some people. So thank you very much, and I think we will be happy to take questions at the breakout session across the hall. Thank you."
