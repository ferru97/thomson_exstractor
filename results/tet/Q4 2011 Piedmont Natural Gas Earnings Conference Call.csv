I know many of you arejust getting back into the office after the holidays, and we appreciate you taking the time to be with us today. As you know, we filed our 2011 10-K and issued our year-end earnings release on December 23. This morning, I'm going to begin on slide two andtalk about our 2011 accomplishments and provide you with a general update on the Company. Then I'll turn it over to Karl to give a more detaileddiscussion of our 2011 financial results and our 2012 guidance. I'm extremely proud of our team's accomplishments in 2011. During another year of continuing economic challenges, we were able to deliver netincome of $114 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.57, towards the upper end of our guidance range. While the housing market has     Slide six demonstrates how our consistent financial performance allows us to reward our shareholders. In 2011, our Board raised the dividend forthe 33rd consecutive year.We remain committed to long-term shareholder value, and our Board understands the importance of a growing dividendto our shareholders. Before I turn the call over to Karl, you've probably noticed a press release we issued last month announcing that Victor Gaglio will join our executivemanagement team next month as our new Senior Vice President and Chief Utility Operations Officer. Victor is currently Senior Vice President ofOperations with NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage. He will be replacing Michael Yount, who announced his intention to retire at the end of February. Michael has been a valued member of our teamover the last six years and we wish him nothing but the best in his retirement. Like Michael, Victor has a wealth of experience in utility operations, having over 30 years of experience in natural gas pipeline, compression, andstorage operations with NiSource and Columbia Gas Transmission. So while we will miss Michael, we are excited to have someone of Victor's caliberjoin our team. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Karl Newlin. Karl?"

As Tom mentioned, we had a great year in 2011 with net income of $114 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.57.This was a 2% improvementfrom last year when you exclude the one-time gain from our sale of a portion of SouthStar in 2010. As a reminder, a reconciliation to GAAP earnings can be found on the last slide of the presentation. As for the details of the income statement, let's start with slide seven. Margin of $574 million increased nearly 4% compared to 2010, due to increasedvolumes and services to industrial and power generation customers, residential and commercial customer growth, net gas cost adjustments andincreased wholesale marketing activity. On the expense side, slide eight, O&M of $225 million was 2.5% higher than last year, due to higher vehicle and transportation expense, a regulatorydisallowance of certain Tennessee franchise fees that led to a one-time charge, and higher materials expense. Slide nine shows depreciation expense of $103 million and general taxes of $38 million, up 4% and 13%, respectively. The increased depreciationwas due to growth in utility investment and plant in service. Higher general taxes were a function of the accrual for and payment of sales tax oncertain customer accounts, as well as higher property taxes in our jurisdictions. On slide 10, income from joint ventures was $24 million in 2011, 17% lower than in 2010, due primarily to a lower ownership percentage of SouthStarduring the entire fiscal year of 2011. Due to the timing of the sale, the first quarter of 2010 had a 30% ownership in SouthStar, while the first quarterof 2011 represented our current 15% ownership. All other income statement categories tracked along their normal trends. Finally, on slide 11, we've outlined our 2012 earnings guidance of $1.58 to $1.68 per share that we reaffirmed in our December 23 earnings release.Our guidance range assumes gross customer additions of 1% the Wayne County project being in service on June 1, 2012 a $3.1 million margindecrease under the South Carolina Rate Stabilization Act, or RSA and a 9% increase in O&M expense. Capital expenditures are expected to bebetween $540 million and $600 million, with $240 million to $280 million associated with our power generation delivery projects. $70 million to$80 million will be related to transmission and pipeline integrity expenditures. On the financing side, we anticipate issuing $300 million of long-term debt during the third quarter. We will also repurchase common shares tooffset issuances from our DRIP and other stock-based programs. We do not anticipate the need to issue any equity in 2012.     With that, I will turn the call back over to Nick."

Just a couple of questions on my side, I guess.The first, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit aboutthe trends you're seeing from the income from equity investments line, excluding SouthStar.You went into some detail in the presentation materialon SouthStar, but just specifically on Pine Needle and Hardy, I noticed Pine Needle's numbers fell down a bit, Hardy's numbers came up a bit. Canyou talk just a little bit about what's kind of moving those numbers and where you see things going into the next year?"
7,18588388,PIEDMONT NATURAL GAS CO.,01/04/2012,3:00PM,PNY,Q4 2011 Piedmont Natural Gas Earnings Conference Call,Karl Newlin,Piedmont Natural Gas,"SVP, CFO",True,False,False,"Yes, sure, Dan. It's Karl. Overall, the joint venture has continued to perform very well. You mentioned Pine Needle specifically. It's down about $1million because they had a rate case implemented that reduced their rates at Pine Needle by FERC during our fiscal 2011, and that reduced thepretax net income by about $1 million. I'd expect some CapEx at Pine Needle in future periods. But all that, of course, is baked into our guidancefor 2012. Hardy continues to perform very well, and then I think you know, on the Cardinal side there should be some increase, just given the CapEx and theexpansion there to serve the Wayne plant."

Maybe just, then, second question on the O&M guidance for 2012, up 9%. Can you just discuss the drivers for the increase in O&M inthe next year?"
9,18588388,PIEDMONT NATURAL GAS CO.,01/04/2012,3:00PM,PNY,Q4 2011 Piedmont Natural Gas Earnings Conference Call,Karl Newlin,Piedmont Natural Gas,"SVP, CFO",True,False,False,"Yes, sure. It's -- O&M is up largely, although not entirely, from nondiscretionary items -- for example, higher pension expense from a lower discountrate is driving our FAS 87 expense, we have higher medical costs due to higher claims in 2011, and we're going to have higher amortization fromexpected recovery of the deferred Tennessee pension asset. Now that has a revenue offset to it, but in the O&M category, that's a higher expenseitem. There was also some other expenses related to the implementation of systems and IT as it relates to pipeline integrity. I think one way to think about that -- I don't want to get into predicting the individual components of O&M too much, but if you think about theincrease of 9%, I think about it as about a third from the benefits category about 25% from an other category, which would be amortization of thedeferred pension expense, etc. and then about 40% is from an increase in payroll from merit adjustments, etc."
10,18588388,PIEDMONT NATURAL GAS CO.,01/04/2012,3:00PM,PNY,Q4 2011 Piedmont Natural Gas Earnings Conference Call,Dan Fidell,US Capitol Advisors,Analyst,True,False,False,"Terrific, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe just a last question or two. On the macro level, I don't know if, Tom, this is a sort of a moregeneralized question. But just specifically in terms of what you see on the docket beyond 2013 for additional regional build projects, if you've gotany in queue or anything you can share on that front? And then, maybe a follow-on question, just talking about how you feel about your current holdings in SouthStar. We've seen recently some otherutilities start to divest the small holdings that they have on the marketing side, refocused toward the infrastructure business. Is that somethingthat you guys would consider as well? And sort of where does that stand with AGLR? Do they have an ability to purchase the remaining 15% or isit entirely yours? I guess those are my two macro questions. Thanks very much."
11,18588388,PIEDMONT NATURAL GAS CO.,01/04/2012,3:00PM,PNY,Q4 2011 Piedmont Natural Gas Earnings Conference Call,Tom Skains,Piedmont Natural Gas,"Chairman, President, CEO",True,False,False,"Okay, good. Good questions. Thank you, Dan. I'll start with SouthStar first. As you know, we entered into a new amended agreement with AGLR on SouthStar a little over a year ago in connection with the sale of half of ourthen 30% ownership stake in the marketing company. We have 15% of the ownership in equity currently going forward. There is no, as you mentioned, additional buyout opportunity for our 15%, so that's a stable investment for us. It's not subject to any right ofpurchase by our partner. We like the business. SouthStar performs well. It's a very profitable investment for our shareholders. We're comfortable with that 15% stake anddon't have any strategic desires at this point to change that position. On the macro level, if you look at the fundamentals of the natural gas industry in my 32 years they've never been better.You look at the enormoussupply -- domestic supply base in our country driving down wholesale natural gas prices to competitive levels that we haven't seen in a decade,perhaps. It's positioned us very well in the marketplace compared to alternative fuels such as propane and oil. There's also upward pressure in our regional markets on electricity rates, whereas we've had rate reductions for our services. So we're positionedvery well in the marketplace. We will continue to pursue and exploit all opportunities we have for investment growth in our core utility, to add not only continuing additions inthe residential and commercial space, but looking at the larger volume market as well in the industrial sector. I mentioned the success that we hadin the industrial market in 2011. We will continue to seek additional opportunities to save industrial customers in our region energy costs that yetprovide us an opportunity to make investment and returns on investments to do so. We will continue to work with the electric utilities in the region as they continue to mature their plans for fleet modernization of power generationfacilities to serve their current and forecasted needs. If and to the extent that replacement of existing units or additional growth requires gas-firedfacilities, we want to be there to serve them and make investments to make that happen. One of the areas that we've continued to evaluate and will look at on a continuing basis this year and in the future is our supply diversity strategyto feed our core utility markets.You've seen evidence of that as we have diversified our supply portfolio away from the Gulf Coast into more diversesupply contracts in the -- across the geographic region that serves the East Coast. As you know, we've previously entered into contracts with Midwestern. We've partnered with NiSource to construct and build the Hardy storagefacility that we're also a customer of. We entered into the Pine Needle regional LNG facility many years ago.     We will continue to look at how we can bring competitive, diverse gas supplies to our markets to benefit our customers, and yet, at the same time,make investments in infrastructure to do that, infrastructure such as pipeline and midstream assets to bring gas supplies into our East Coast markets.So that's a strategy that we will continue to pursue. We think there's an opportunity for us to provide benefits to our customers, but also makeadditional investment opportunities for (inaudible) benefits at the same time."

I'm wondering if you can break out what you think the impact would befrom Wayne County if that does go into service in early June."

We do assume the project goes into service on June 1, and contractually we begin recovery of the cost, as well as a return on the costsper the contract, beginning on June 1. And all that is baked into our guidance assumptions."

Need to be careful here because our contract with Progress for these projects are confidential and subject to a nondisclosure agreement. We had disclosed previously, with their consent, the fact that these are long-term contracts, that they do contain fixed-cost recovery throughstraight fixed variable rate design.They were subject to approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, and for purposes of your assumptions,I would assume that these would be continued core utility investments that generate utility type of regulated returns."

I was also wondering if you could just give us an update on the CNG initiative for fueling stations, just what the thinkingis right now and if there's anything that we might see on that front in 2012."
19,18588388,PIEDMONT NATURAL GAS CO.,01/04/2012,3:00PM,PNY,Q4 2011 Piedmont Natural Gas Earnings Conference Call,Karl Newlin,Piedmont Natural Gas,"SVP, CFO",True,False,False,"Sure, Jim. It's Karl. We continue to prosecute that market, I guess I would call it.     The way we look at it is essentially we're a fleet operator. We roll about 900 trucks every day, and we are converting a number of our vehicles to beeither CNG dedicated or bi-fuel vehicles. And so, we realize the benefits of operating natural gas as a fleet operator and owner ourselves. When we do that, we build refueling stations at our current resource centers. And to the extent there is excess capacity, we try and market that tocommercial fleets in and around our service territory. I can tell you that the team that we have dedicated to that is working diligently. A lot of it is education in the marketplace, trying to convince peopleof the benefits of natural gas and how they can use it in their fleets on a daily basis. And so, I think they're getting some traction, but it's very small[effort] at this point. And I think in terms of any benefits, the greatest benefit to us in the near term, essentially in 2012, will be as a fleet operator burning the naturalgas versus more expensive diesel and gasoline."
