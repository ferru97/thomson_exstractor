3,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,"Thanks Mike. Welcome everybody and thank you for joining us this morning. We are very pleased to tell you about our transaction and the formation of our new Company, silver will energy. Before I start I want to knowledge the tremendous work -- by our team and how very and tech team in Vancouver as well is the their most devicesthat have assisted us in putting this deal together over the Christmas and New Year's period, a difficult time for any of us with families, which is ofcourse most of us. And the way, this will be a fairly short call covering the transaction, and a description of the new Company and what assets willbe in the new Company. I turn your attention to the forward-looking statements on slides two and three. I'm particularly, if you just would take a second to look at slide four, as for -- but as the resource disclosure. When we are talking about Silver Willow -- we will be talking about this governor bitumen -- in place. We talked about contingent resources I wanted to draw your attention to this distinction, we discovered bitumen initially in place. It's move on to slide five, and we will start discussing the proposed transaction. Silver Willow As Mike mentioned, is being created through a plan of arrangement. And the construction of this transaction is quite similar to the one that we did 15 months ago between UTS and total. It is familiar for us as we put this together. Teck Resources all of SilverBirch is common shares, and Silver Willow shareholders and Silver Willow pinning the share holder Company, $8.50 pershare in cash plus one share of Silver Willow. Additionally tech will constitute $75 million in cash and will contribute 50% working interest in the Birch Mountain's and Georgian properties whichwe held jointly to Silver Willow. Also assets will be transferred to Silver Willow accept working interest in frontier and Equinox project and the twin Lakes leases which of coursetech will keep. As a result, so we're will which will be focused on Institute rather than our former the mining site will 100% of debt properties, Birch Mountain'sleases, and the Jordan leases and will be capitalized initially with $25 million. Let's go to slide six."
4,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,"To focus in a little bit on the details, the cash component that you'd shareholder, SilverBirch shareholder will receive is $8.50 and for each share ofSilverBirch they hold they will receive a share of silver will, which will have approximately $.50 a working capital per share plus approximately 30-- discovered resource per share in the -- property. Of course at the moment we have no knowledge of resources discovered or otherwise and the Birch Mountain or Jordan properties. In addition to the lands described, we will also have 117,000 acres of exploration. As far as the headline metrics, based just on the cash component alone, and that is the cash that shareholders receive and that is the cash goinginto Silver Willow , SilverBirch shareholders will receive a 25% premium to a closing price on January 9 and a 30% premium to the 20 day volumeweighted average price. As an important point here, SilverBirch board of management unanimously recommending acceptance of this offer to SilverBirch shareholders,and -- agreements have been signed and the two major shareholders West face and the -- let's move to the slide seven, I will talk a bit about SilverWillow. As SilverBirch announced back in October, we have confirmed a significant resource potential on the on that property northeast of Fort McMurray. We are in the field grilling as we speak, we've got started a couple of days ago and we will have additional information which by the end of thisyear should allow us to determine contingent resources on this property. We also have the additional upside in the Birch Mountain's area, immediately west of frontier so this is the exploration lands where the oil sandsare a little deeper buried, and as you may have noticed in the past couple of years, this has been quite active expiration with a number of countrieswith a number of programs going on in the Birch Mountain's. We have taken across the complete management team and the board for the previous Company from SilverBirch to Silver Willow, so you will havethe same experienced leadership training -- do with its proven exploration and development record working for you for the shareholders in SilverWillow. We also have a work plan focused on doing what we do best, which is exploring these properties and moving them forward along the regulatorypath and the engineering path and determining what the value is whether it makes sense to keep advancing the project or looking for partners,or looking for constructive deals once we know what we have and have the risk to the process for possible partners. And of course we will have additional working capital of approximately $25 million that will be subject to working capital corrections and adjustmentsfollowing closing."
5,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,"We will move on to slide eight. There's a series of slides now, which take us through the land position and we can have a better appreciation of what lands Silver Willow will own. On slide eight, you can see the current situation in which the shows the lands that we have primarily 50/50 with tech buyer to closing with theexception of -- which currently SilverBirch owned 100% and -- is on the right side of the map there. If you go to slide nine in bright blue, highlighted the lands that Teck will now have 100% of. The frontier project, Equinox project, and the twinLakes leases just on the east of the Athabasca River.     If you flip to slide 10, this highlights the lens that Silver Willow will own 100% of, that very large exploration block on the West side, the BirchMountain's, the Jordan lands on the middle of the map, and then the Audette leases on the east side of the map, which have the discoveredresources that I mentioned earlier. And we will spend a little bit of time talking about Audette, because that is the focus of our activity right now. Let's move on to slide 11. This is the summary of the discovered bitumen initially in place on the Audet Lands. This summary is from -- report that was released in October by SilverBirch, October 2011. As pointed out below that, we also have the urge mountainsleases, 100% working interest in non-leases, 100 or a seven sections, very extensively position and then the Jordan positions 100% working interestinto leases comprising Earnie six sections. We will talk to slide 12. Again, people who are familiar with SilverBirch, this will be a familiar drawing. Where moving object forward toward development, but of course we have quite a ways to go yet. The 2012 winter program as I mentioned is just underway, and in addition to additional to litigation drilling, we will be doing some 2-D seismicand a key part of the program will be a -- and valuation. One of the important things about the Audette lease is that we know that the cap rock is intermittent across the least. Our focus this year is to identify an area where there is sufficient cash rock to allow us to proceed for the conventional -- project. We are quite confident that the resources that are based on last year's drilling program and we know that that is a very high-quality, quite thickcontinuous bitumen resource. The technical issue as far as production will be this president -- presence of caprock. However having said that, we also know there are new emerging technologies that may be applicable even if the caprock is somewhat limited orintermittent. We believe this whole area has tremendous potential because of the size of the resource. The drilling will continue through the first 6 to 8 weeks of this year, and then of course the analysis cycle goes through the geotechnical testing ofthe caprock samples, the analysis of the many frac test it we will be doing, and then once that data is all assembled and analyzed and evaluatingby our independent assessors, we should be able to report contingent resources either by the end of this year or in 2013. The project scheduledbelow is a notional because of course it assumes that we are successful improving our technical -- but one could conjecture that it would be viableto have production from these leases by 2016 or 2017 timeframe based on normal regulatory and development cycles."
6,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,"Let's move on to slide 13. Moving towards the summary here, but that's basically provides us a platform for growth, and as we mentioned that his1.6 9 billion barrels of discovered resourcing place, we will have our contingent resource by the end of this year. We will also commenced desktop assessment of the Birch Mountain's resources, which back in the UTS days we put seven -- core roles into thoseleases on very preliminary explorations. And the balance of this year, we will be doing some desktop work to identify best locations for seismic and perhaps drilling, and it will be later inthe year before we can announce what we plan to do as far as an expiration program of those leases.     Jordan, some interesting level patch of land, quite close to some other major projects. The eight core holes that have been drilled into date have indicated there is bitumen, but it's not very extensive. However, we believe that this might be an interesting opportunity for some shallow unconventional approaches to extraction and so we willbasically look at it in that light, and see how that might be taking forward. As we do this work, of course we are open-minded to consider joint venture prospects or other approaches and looking at the best way for SilverWillow shareholders as to how to -- and move onto slide 14. As far as financing, the initial $25 million will be used to finance our exploration workand analysis 40 balance of this year and of course G&A and miscellaneous expenses as part of the transaction, tech has provided an interim $20million loan facility and that is buyers in the middle of the year, but it helps tide us over and the shortfalls of cash during the closing period andshortly thereafter. So we are looking to once again be successful with the drill-bit to drive the Company forward and create the financing flexibility and strategicopportunities. We believe that we successfully feel, you will all is to continue us to fund our objective in the our exploration and development objectives."

We believe we have provided a significant premium to our shareholders, our shareholders, Schilder birch shareholders will receive a one for oneshare in the Silver Willow Company I'm a 10 SilverBirch shareholders will retain their resource outside through its exposure to Silver Willow, andyour management team is here to go to work on the Silver Willow resources. Finally, the Board of Directors has unanimously approved his plan and recommend that SilverBirch shareholders vote in favor of it. I will finish myprepared comments at this point, and turn it back to Mike and the operator for the next step."

I wanted to go over the regulatory approvals. I did the that you are expecting this deal to close late April. Was wondering if you could go over that timeline. I did see here that you've got some shareholders to support this transaction, so if you can talk about the background and how you guys came tothis transaction. I missed the first part of the call, I apologize if you discussed this already."

13,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,"Okay, I understand that. No, we have been through a long strategic process, actually we are pretty well 12 months now, once SilverBirch was formed October October 2010,we basically got up and running and got settled in and starting in January and starting in January 2011, we formed an informal strategic workinggroup with some of the members of the board was also our financial advisors joined the team as well. And we basically look at the strategic options for the Company, understanding the assets that we had. Of course at that time, we didn't have any results from our audit drilling program, so we did not know the scale of the opportunity. During the first three or four months of that strategic process, we were assessing our asset and then getting to understand what we had on theobject property. By midyear, we had some additional information. We had a pretty good industry and in -- understanding of the scale at Audette, and we'll say completion of the design basis memorandum, theresource update on frontier and equinox, and probably the key factor was in end of June, we had the revised capital cost estimate for frontier andequinox projects. Again, with those bits of information, we were able to get a pretty good handle on the potential economics of frontier and equinox as well as whatthe capital on some desk want some that would be required from SilverBirch Tuesday May project at 50/50. All along we heard all is said SilverBirch     at some point we would look at our options for how great our participation in the -- will be and that we would be quite open to constructive waysto reduce our interest. As long as they created value for the shareholders. The financial advisors also conducted a confidential low-key process of contacting potential participants who might be willing to either participatewith us , by our shares, and the number of the normal kind of things would consider and that was quite extensive, it was international, that it wasn'ta public process. At the same time, commencing and about Midsummer, we also started negotiations with tech -- Teck on our partnership agreement. And long-standing commitment between both ourselves and Teck was to form a partnership and properly paper it with a partnership agreement. Through that process, we had to examine value, all parties examine value and we are looking at ways to make a good agreement, having learneda lot from our participation also with Teck any Fort Hills agreement and recognizing there were if you things in that agreement that hadn't workedwell for junior partner. Particularly junior financial crisis. We wanted to come up with a similar worship agreement but something that provided flexibility for the smaller Company, SilverBirch. We work hard with Teck to put that kind of agreement together, and actually had something that we could put in front of our boards and ultimatelythen just two days before Christmas,Teck came back with the offer that we are looking at now rather than proceed with the partnership approach. Willie, it was quite a long process, interest our partners talk to a lot of different parties over the intervening period and family came to what webelieve now is the offer we have -- a good offer we have in front of us now."

29,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,"Yes, it was really just a negotiation. We as SilverBirch didn't feel strongly about keeping 20 lakes -- on the geological potential, it's probably limited and that is SilverBirch view, andthat is only subject to the limited drilling that has been done to date. Teck Was interested in keeping 20 lakes, so it was easy for us to make that swap of those lands."

It's there somewhere to the one that we have in place now. Is put in place to provide fact flexibility. The rate is very competitive with what we have now. Related to product. And it's just been in place other we have some flexibility point forward and we hadn't done this transaction, we probably would've raised themaggregate, this gives us some flexibility to move forward with our capital spending program."

39,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,And your right not with Scotia Capital.
40,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,"Good morning as Katherine Sarah. Just two questions. To clarify the loan facility -- when the transaction closes, you'll use the $25 million working capital funding in part to repay that facility?"
41,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,"Yes, but there is $24 million cash and SilverBirch right now. We will also have proceeds from exercise of options, which we estimate up to now will be about $22 million to SilverBirch. That actually in the time period between on closing by our calculations, gives us sufficient cash to meet current obligations and the first threemonths of drilling and 2012. So by closing, SilverBirch as working capital will be essentially zero. And the $25 million that will be contributed by Teck will go into Silver Willow. As Wayne said, the $20 million loan provides us the flexibility because obviously the proceeds from the exercise of options will only come at closing,and so if there is a shortfall on cash just due to timing reasons, because drilling programs tend to be quite financially intense and spend a lot ofmoney in a hurry, and the bills come in very quickly. We are just assuming that there may be a cash shortfall and that is really what the loan will be used for. So in theory by closing, we should have most of the $25 million in tax once we start with Silver Willow."
42,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,"That makes sense, thank you. And just a question on the timing. Silver Willow is being listed, do you expect that it's listing will be collected in with the closing of the transaction? Or is it possible we might see the arrangement close and then a few weeks later Silver Willow start to trade ?"
43,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,I will turn onto Gina.

Our hope is that we will start listing our coins that with the closing so we would close one day and start trading at Silver Willow been asked. That is what we are working towards.

Are the twin Lakes areas an area that was contemplated potentially as a gift to the -- for environmental Park and recreation area?

There's been discussion of that kind of thing from time to time, that nothing ever followed up on. I think there is actually -- if you look at it John,all the SilverBirch and Teck hot on our was the oil sands leases. We don't have any of the -- but how Teck will make use of this land obviously is a question for Teck."

56,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,"The -- a pair cash and cut the waiting as the 435 cash plus the $25 million working capital or 460 decided by 1.4 barrels or $.33 per barrel. And that is less than the two dollar apparent price at the time at a lower oil price. So at -- sold to -- admittedly it's not apples and oranges, because the degree of engineering and -- construction isn't the same. But could you talk to the sixfold difference in valuation? And why you are embracing selling frontier Equinox at 1/6 of the term or even if you made an adjustment for the difference in phase, one third ofthe terms."
57,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,"Yes. I think that one is one we could certainly respond to. If you look, the number we use is about $.34 a barrel. I agree with your Thai collation, we come to the number slightly different see but it is $0.34 a barrel. If you think of frontier and Equinox as -- stage, we don't have any regulatory approval at this pace, at this point. We have literally just amended the application or a least Teck had at the end of the year last year. And where is Fort Hills had regulatory approval in place by the time we exited that project eight years, and two point and $2.8 billion had beenspent by the partners. In addition, UTS had an earnings rates, and there is additional value in Fort Hills from the earning. When you compare the metrics, it is quite a different transaction. Also keep in mind that frontier and Equinox will not commence production until about 2020 or 21. And the issue that was facing SilverBirch theeven prior to sanction, the partnership would have to spend $300 million-$500 million just to get to --. That's over the next three or four years. And we recognize that for us, that would be quite dilutive with the equity we would raise, the quite dilutive for SilverBirch shareholders and theoffer from a made by Teck seem to be quite fair and quite reasonable and that was why we made the decision to proceed."

The calculation of $0.34 per barrel is only the cash consideration. There is the much more difficult question of value in the in situ asset or in situ potential assets. That Teck is what they with you in addition to the cash consideration. Did you assess only the cat -- cash consideration and avoided a bit loose in or did you assign value to the in situ assets were the documentationand the potential recovery rates, the existence of the bitumen and recover ability of the bitumen require a greater standard of documentation. They are deeper into."
59,18607860,SILVERBIRCH ENERGY CORP,01/09/2012,2:00PM,SBE.V,Teck Resources Limited to acquire SilverBirch,Unknown Speaker,NA,NA,False,True,False,"Of course the potential value of the lands played into our consideration. Because obviously we are quite optimistic about the potential of both our debt -- Audette and Birch Mountain's. As far as formally assigning value, we basically for our own the collation just use the book value which provides quite a modest amount of value. I believe by closing book value and the various properties will be about $90 million. A little over one dollar and 80 $1.80 per share for the book value going into Silver Willow. Obviously held the market values that we will get to see in the next few days, but it was in a calculation from the point of view of establishing totalvalue but as far as the metrics we have referenced, we have only referenced the cash component."

Is we are looking at it as a conventional -- and I think as we mentioned in previous calls, that we did have -- we did find some pretty extensiveoccurrences of what we believe will be a sold will -- suitable caprock material. While we don't know is how extensive.     Our opening position is if we can -- caprock materials existence of a big enough area and the modeling and the taxpaying and the many frac testshowed sufficient for conventional -- I wouldn't call it will pressure, sort of a moderate pressure site B., that's basically a conventional approach,and so that if we find that that would necessarily be technically feasible, we would look at other -- related approaches maybe was solid assist orlow pressure -- as is being dried out and the other places and then a further fallback would be some of the new techniques that some of the othercoming seven talking about, some of the electrical or other solid assist type tactics.

And of course, our other advisor has been involved in a number of applications. So are reasonably aware on the consultants of the regulatory requirements, we recognize that there is a bit of a work in progress, how that willevolve over the next 12 to 24 months. But we are certainly taking an approach that is relatively conservative as we consider what the operating pressures would be as we do in the currentmodeling. And it goes to current modeling is really just an early scope things that he does to try and understand what the potential will be, there will befurther rounds of engineering once we have the many frac test, the rest of the data from the geotechnical program and more resource data."
