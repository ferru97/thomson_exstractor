Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 earnings conference call. We issued ourEarnings Release and a supplemental presentation earlier this morning. If you do not have the release and the presentation, we issued today, youwill find copies of them on our website at IHS.com. Some of our comments and discussions on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP or adjusted numbers include stock-basedcompensation and other non-cash charges and other items. Our Earnings Release includes both our GAAP-based income statement and statementof cash flows, and reconciliations to the non-GAAP measures discussed during this call. These reconciliation schedules can also be found on ourweb site. The non-GAAP results are a supplement to the GAAP financial statements. IHS believes this non-GAAP presentation and the eliminationof these items is useful in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance.

Good morning, welcome, and a very happy New Year to all of our investors and to my IHS colleagues. It is a great pleasure thismorning to share with you our outstanding results from the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2011. Before I do, I must begin with a real heart-feltthank you to my IHS colleagues around the world. The performance I'm about to share with you is the direct result of the outstanding teamworkand collaboration displayed by each of my colleagues. I'm very proud to be part of this team. I'll start with the quarterly financial highlights. Revenue was up 27% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 33%. And our adjustedEBITDA margin was 32.1%, the highest in our Company's history. The absolute dollar levels for Q4 revenue and profit were both Company records.Q4 proved to be exactly what we thought it would be, accelerating organic growth on the top line, accompanied by meaningful margin expansion. Our fourth quarter performance is a fitting capstone on a year characterized by focus and performance. In early November of 2010, we shared ourvision for what we would accomplish in 2011. Since then, the world has seen many economic events that certainly have presented challenges forbusinesses around the world. Despite these global economic challenges, we actively managed IHS to ensure that we continued to make the rightinvestment decisions to drive strong, profitable growth and to deliver ever-better insight, information, and analytics to our customers around theglobe every day. Therefore, I am proud to share with you these annual results. Revenue was up 25%. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 26%. And our adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.2%, up from last year, despite the significantlevels of investment in infrastructure that we've made during 2011. This performance is the direct outcome of the following. A clear vision of whatwe're building. An intense focus on the four objectives we set for ourselves this year. And relentless execution while adapting our priorities tochanging market conditions throughout the year. Scott Key, our President and COO, and Rich Walker, our EVP and CFO, will provide more detailsshortly. As you know, we have four Company objectives. Colleague success, customer delight, profitable top and bottom line growth, and share ownersuccess relative to our peer group. Execution of these objectives drove solid results. The foundation of this performance is the engagement of ourcolleagues and the level of customer delight. During 2011, 97% of our colleagues participated in our annual engagement survey, providing us witha clear view of actions and experiences that most affect our commitment and performance at IHS. Our colleague engagement score for 2011 was59%. And represents a recalibration of our baseline with a new third-party survey firm that offers an excellent set of analytics and benchmarks aswe move to a new level of excellence. We have achieved world-class performance in a number of important areas, including the value colleagues derive from their work. And the freedomof flexibility they have in delivering value to our customers. Importantly, we saw best-in-class levels in impact that our colleagues are having withcustomers as a result of increased colleague collaboration at IHS in creating value. We also achieved best-in-class levels in our focus on customers.This not only correlated to our financial performance. It's tied to the highest level of customer delight since we launched this critical effort five yearsago. This year, thousands of IHS customers provided their feedback and we were pleased with the results. Here are the highlights. Most global companies are scoring flat to down this year but we achieved a 4 point improvement to reach 63% customer delight. All three of ourregions improved. 100% of our product areas showed improved customer delight. Because we achieved our improvement target, we awarded toeach of our colleagues 50 IHS restricted stock units.This represents approximately $18 million in value.The shares will vest over the next 12 months.     We award shares because the incentive directly drives the behavior we want and the results we enjoy. For example, in the fourth quarter wedelivered the highest level of subscription-based organic growth in 10 quarters. These results are directly connected to our overall performance. And highlight the shareholder value we create in connecting colleague andcustomer metrics to shareholder returns for our stock-based incentives. We've driven substantial value for shareholders since our IPO, with acompounded annual return of 32%, well above that of our peers and the overall market.This is a clear reflection of our focus on long-term profitablegrowth and our share-based incentive programs that directly link every IHS colleague to key customer metrics and financial performance. Now, switching gears, we previously discussed the importance of strategic partnerships to our market growth and for new channel development.We continue to create the right partnerships to drive our long-term profitable growth. I'm pleased to announce that IHS has signed a strategicalliance agreement with IBM. This agreement will enable us to help clients meet complex enterprise sustainability management, ESM, challengesby leveraging our combined strengths to provide the content, software and expertise that our customers need.This alliance is another step forwardin leveraging the growing opportunities in enterprise sustainability. By offering IHS content and systems, in combination with IBM's expertise intechnology implementation and integration, we will make it easier for our clients to turn traditional information management burdens intocompetitive advantages. Organizations throughout the IHS and IBM customer base will have the opportunity to benefit from this new alliance.We're pleased that IBM has recognized the importance of the ESM market and our technology leadership in that space. Let me wrap up with brief updates on our two major infrastructure projects,Vanguard and Newton.We've had another great success in the roll-outof Vanguard. On December 5, we went live with the second release.This release included a significant part of our finance organization and customercare in EMEA and Americas.With the successful implementation, approximately 40% of our business is now being processed through the Vanguardsystem. In addition to the roll-out of Vanguard, our EMEA and Americas finance and customer care Centers of Excellence are now operational. And ourAPAC Center of Excellence opened December 5 and will continue to grow with the needs of our business. My many thanks and congratulationsto the Vanguard team, to our finance and customer care teams, and to all other colleagues from across the Company who have worked diligentlyto ensure we remain on schedule. It's rare for any Company to smoothly implement a global ERP, not to mention implementing a change that isreplacing 40-plus legacy systems in countries all over the world. In parallel, we've gone live with our SFA world-wide, including our automated commission system. I am very grateful for this very impressiveexecution. Our current plan calls for substantially all of our finance and lead-through-cash systems to be migrated over to Vanguard by the end of2012. And we are right on track with that goal. Another high priority initiative to support our multi-year growth strategy is Project Newton, whichis addressing the issue of our multiple data centers and content management and delivery system.We're making great progress here as we eliminateredundant activities and shut down legacy data systems. With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Scott."
3,18595681,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Scott Key,IHS Inc.,"President, COO",False,True,False,"Thanks, Jerre. I will give you an overview of our growth and progress during Q4 that helped to deliver the performance for the year, provide someoverarching thoughts about the strategic development of the business as we close 2011 and look to 2012, and finally, a brief update on SMT andintegration efforts. Q4 was a quarter of improving profitable growth for IHS. And a clear, well-executed step toward achieving our long-term profitable growth goals.Just about any way you look at the results, we saw solid growth in operational performance. Overall we delivered 9.4% organic growth for thequarter and we delivered 8.7% for the full year. Absent the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code recall in Q3 2010, we had to try a new release of the BPVC,an engineering standard. All organic figures mentioned hereafter have been normalized to exclude the BPVC, as applicable. Our organic growthperformance marks positive acceleration sequentially and year on year.     And our financial results reflect this. We are ahead of our initial projections. And we enjoyed roughly 50% margins during our first full quarter ofownership. My sincere thanks to our SMT colleagues and all of those involved in the integration efforts for a job well done. Keep up the great work. So, before I hand the call over to Rich, let me wrap up 2011 by saying we had a very good year. We enter 2012 with momentum, despite theheadwinds all of us are experiencing on the macroeconomic front. Our own experts do continue to view the macro climate soberly. We use theirwisdom to plan for the future and it is reflected in our guidance. Now let me hand the call over to Rich."
4,18595681,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Rich Walker,IHS Inc.,"EVP, CFO",False,True,False,"Thank you, Scott. I'll provide an overview of our results and an update to our 2012 annual guidance. Let's start with revenue. Fourth quarter 2011revenue increased 27% to $371 million.The growth in revenue includes 9.4% organic growth, 17% growth from acquisitions, and virtually nothingfrom currency fluctuations. The organic growth on subscriptions was 9.1% in the fourth quarter. And subscriptions accounted for 74% of revenueduring the quarter.This rate of organic growth is a sequential increase since the prior quarter, and lifted us to 8.7% organic growth for the full year.On the non-subscription businesses, they also performed well, growing at 10.4% organically. Consulting had a terrific quarter, growing 16%organically, where we saw strong demand for our offerings, particularly in energy, autos and chemicals. Looking at regional and domain performance, revenue growth was robust and broad-based as Americas grew revenue 23% all-in, with EMEA andAPAC growing 26%, and 49%, respectively. In terms of performance, EMEA was particularly notable. Its subscription business grew organically inthe low double digits for the quarter. It is really impressive performance in light of the broader economy. Relative to revenue performance bydomain, energy continues to be the stalwart performer. Energy was 45% of total revenue and was up 38% all-in for the quarter. Energy remainsstrong across most every offering and in all three geographies. And grew organically at strong double-digit rates. Product life cycle was 31% of revenue, and increased 23% for the quarter. PLC benefited from the fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of iSuppli, whichgrew at a double-digit organic growth rate during the quarter. Security was 8% of revenue, up 2% all-in for the quarter. Solid subscription performancewas partially offset by lower non-subscription results due to timing of sales. Environment was 8% of overall revenue, up 31% all-in for the quarter.Environment benefited from acquisitions and solid organic growth.The remaining 7% of revenue is in our macroeconomic capabilities, which wereup 8% all-in for the quarter, almost all of which was organic growth. Turning now to profit and margins. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $119 million, up 33% from a year ago.To put this in context, this is onlythe second time in our Company's history we've generated more than $100 million in adjusted EBITDA in a single quarter. And up almost $20million sequentially from the third quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin improved, as expected, and was 32.1% in the fourth quarter. This is a 150basis point increase over last year. Strong organic revenue growth, combined with good cost control, added about 120 basis points of marginexpansion in the quarter. The remaining 30 basis points came from acquisitions. FX had virtually no impact to margins during the quarter. Moving down the P&L, adjusted EPS increased 24% to a record $0.99 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. Regarding segment profitability,Americas adjusted EBITDA increased 27% to $86 million. While EMEA's adjusted EBITDA was up 29% to $32 million. And APAC's adjusted EBITDAgrew 60% to $15 million. The reported GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was affected by the fourth quarter implementation of ourpension strategy. Excluding this impact, the tax rate was 24.2%. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $235 million of cash, and$803 million of debt. Deferred revenue at the end of the fourth quarter was $487 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of $95 millionor 24%. Turning to cash flow. We generated $89 million of cash flow from operations and $80 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. In fiscal 2011,we generated $288 million of free cash flow. And our ratio of free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA was 72%. As these measures suggest, we continuedto generate strong cash flow despite higher levels of investment in the business. One last item before I get to our 2012 guidance update. As I mentioned on our call in November, during 2011 we undertook a comprehensivereview of our US pension plan, designed to ensure we maintain market competitive employee benefits while decreasing volatility. I am pleased to     report we have completed our review. We have been proactive in our actions and believe we have made prudent business decisions with respectto these plans that position us well on a go-forward basis. Many plan sponsors have employed similar steps to better manage their pension programs. These steps resulted in a one-time settlement of retiree pension obligation, a change to our pension plan investment strategy, a change in ourpension accounting policy, and an accelerated funding of plan contributions. It is not our intention to discuss these actions in detail on this call.Alternatively, we have compiled a slide deck which explains in greater detail our objective, the steps we have taken, and their impact. This deck isposted on our website and also furnished earlier today to the SEC.We encourage you to review these materials. And should you have any questions,please give us a call to discuss further. Now let's go to 2012 guidance. Our guidance is on an all-in basis and assumes no further acquisitions, currency movements, mark-to-market pensionadjustments, or unanticipated events. For 2012, we expect all-in revenue in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion, including 7% to 10% organicgrowth for the full year. All-in adjusted EBITDA in a range of $480 million to $495 million. Depreciation and amortization expense to approximate$112 million. Net interest expense of roughly $17 million. Adjusted EPS between $3.84 to $4.01 per diluted share. Stock-based compensationexpense to approximate $115 million to $120 million. And adjusted tax rate of approximately 27% to 28%. And fully diluted shares to be approximately67 million. A couple of additional items to note regarding guidance. As you consider our quarterly profit progression for 2012, remember that due to theseasonality in our business, Q1 revenue and adjusted EBITDA tend to be lower sequentially relative to the fourth quarter. In fact, Q1 is traditionallyour lowest quarter of the year for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percent of the annual totals.Moreover, this trend has been amplified going forward by the product mix from our 2011 acquisition and the recent pension strategy implementation.To illustrate this point, please see the last slide in the supplemental deck posted to our website which shows our 2011 quarterly profit distribution,adjusted as if we had made an $8 million pension expense similar to 2012. This slide highlights the fact the fourth quarter represented 30% of our2011 adjusted profit, whereas the first quarter represented 21%. Last, we expect CapEx in 2012 to remain relatively flat to 2011 levels. Importantly, we expect CapEx to decrease as a percent of revenue from 4.1%in 2011, to about 3.5% in 2012. Over the long run, we generally expect CapEx to annually represent between 3% to 4% of revenue. In summary,we saw accelerating top-line organic growth, a resumption of meaningful overall margin expansion, and robust cash flow. With that, let me turn the call back over to Jerre."

But how much of it is attributed to bringing in acquisitions that anniversaried, and movingunder-performing businesses to Discontinued Operations? What I'm trying to figure out is how did the underlying business perform if you wereto comp it to Q3 growth?"

Suzi, we actually saw very broad and solid organic performance across the business. And I'll give you a few examples. We gave you theregion numbers where you saw positive growth. Our subscription base really trended up and positively across the globe. In Americas, we saw aseries of areas of double-digit organic growth in automotive, the transportation sector, our core economics offerings, and our offerings inmanufacturing and design and energy technical. We saw really positive improvement in our strategically managed accounts that drove organicgrowth higher. And we saw that in all regions, real good progress, 3 to 5 percentage points of additional, above our average organic growth in strategically managedaccounts in the Americas, EMEA and APAC. And then the other point of growth driver, as you heard, Latin America, 20%-plus, and of course, APAC,20%-plus. So, really strong fundamentals. And I think the other point to mention is that was matched, regardless of organic or inorganic onacquisitions. Acquisitions in general delivered about 16% year-on-year growth on average. So, we really saw solid performance everywhere."

If you look, our fastest-growing business continued to be the energy business in Q4, remarkableperformance. There was no shift with the organic growth there. It did not include any acquisitions falling into Q4. So, just a really great quartereverywhere. Thank you. Next question."

And maybe an example being how much percentof your renewals to your subscriptions occur or have already occurred coming into 2012? And just somewhat related to that in terms of just, again,on the back of the economic environment, what changes, if any, are there to your appetite for M&A this year?"
13,18595681,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Jerre Stead,IHS Inc.,"Chairman, CEO",True,False,False,"Great question. Let me pick it up, and we'll start with that, Manav. Actually, you just tried to sneak in a second question. But I'll probably respondto that quickly for everybody. A very good question. 32% of our renewals occur in Q1. Q4 is our second strongest, and then the other two are a bitlighter. If you think about the fact that we're a November 30 business, December is a big month for us, as you would expect, because a lot ofcompanies that are on a calendar year do renew then. So, 32%. I'm going to have Scott give a little color on that in just a second. On your question B, we are feeling very good. Continue to, with the acquisition pipeline we've got, complementary, fit our strategic goals and willfit going forward. So, we feel very good about that. Before I color Scott on Manav's first question, then Rich, anything else you've got on M&A?"

It's 60%, one-third of it in the first quarter. So, the visibility on how we exit the year gives us great confidence.The M&A pipeline, in general, it remains very robust. Very pleased with the broad-based distribution of it, particularly the focus on emerging andgrowth economies and industries that we're keenly focused on."

As we sit at this point in time, we have visibility to about 60%of our renewal base, as Rich mentioned. So, 30%-plus in Q1, and also a large portion in Q4. So, obviously we're working three, four, five monthsahead with customers. So, we really have great visibility to over 60% of the renewal base as we sit here in early January, good view on the year,and obviously strong momentum coming out of the end of last year. The other thing to note is our renewals still, on average, tend to be above 90%. And really great discipline with new sales systems where you see,first of all, the timeliness of renewals at the highest levels ever in the Company. And that's just a sales system we deployed over the last year, focusedon the right structure and organization in sales. And of course, good global sales operations processes."

And are you still pushing towards that9% for the overall year?"

As you remember, on our 2012 guidance call, Scott told us that his personal goal was 9% organic. And your question's a goodone, Eric, because an important part of that is the Other category, about 22%, 23% of our total. So, Scott, pick up both pieces?"
20,18595681,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Scott Key,IHS Inc.,"President, COO",True,False,False,"Yes, thanks. And what you saw in Q4, actually, was those non-subscription areas lifting the business and performing really positively. And I'll tellyou, we've spent, Eric, a lot of time over the last two years ensuring that those non-subscription parts of our business were tightly connected withthe subscription part of the business. And that's helping us drive growth. So, I'd tell you three things. One, part of those nonrecurring businessesare connections, integration, and tighter value creation around our information for customers. And we've launched some electronic informationmanagement services over the last year, which are growing above 20%, and really tightly linked to our underlying information subscription basegrowth. So, really strong performance there in nonrecurring that's driving growth.     Then in terms of services, advisory services and consulting, we saw positive performance all through the year. And ended the year in double-digitgrowth there in each region as a result of, again, tying our advisory services to our insight and analytics, and really measured growth of that business.So, we feel good about the level where we have demand higher, we're able to fulfill. That's a great place to be right now. And then the last piece that's in that nonrecurring area, of course, is some of our software and platform sales, both in energy, great work flow toolsthat tie our information with our analytics. And of course, in environment. So, all of those three areas of solid growth by region that we feel goodabout as we head into the year."

And what I'd like to know is, as we think about 2012, what are the key drivers of themargin improvement? How important are Vanguard and Newton to the upside you see? And can you talk a little bit about the seasonality inmargins? Is it going to be as fourth-quarter loaded in '12 as it was in '11?"
24,18595681,IHS INC,01/06/2012,1:00PM,IHS,Q4 2011 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call,Jerre Stead,IHS Inc.,"Chairman, CEO",True,False,False,"Excellent question, Peter. Thank you. I'll work backwards on it. As you heard Rich talk just now, in that package that's on our website, you'll see, tomake sure we see and help you with what goes on quarter by quarter, you'll see that adjusted 2011 quarter-by-quarter percent of profit -- 30% inQ4, 21% in Q1. So, using that, there's three key factors that have happened. One, we did want to give you that perspective because with theacquisitions we've actually seen a shift of an increase in EBITDA profit in Q4, and we've got that built in. Secondly, we're feeling very good, I mustsay, about the amazing effort that has gone on with Vanguard, our Centers of Excellence, many other things at the same time. Scott mentioned in his part of the prepared script the fact that we'll also be introducing more new products in 2012 than we have in the history ofour business. So, if you think about new products taking a while to move in, and take on the opportunity for growth, all of those drive us prettyclearly to that 30% that we say happened last year, as one that we would expect to see continue as a model. I'm going to ask Rich to pick up, andScott, in just a second. But the other thing is, we felt very good all year long. I know many of our investors were wondering whether we would indeed deliver the 32%margin in Q4 that we were consistent about all year. We did that. We feel very good about where we're going into 2012. A lot of productivityimprovements, sales force automation, et cetera. Equally important is to think through into 2013 because as we exit 2012, many of the benefits ofscaling, as Scott mentioned in his call, for the first time will now be in place. So, increasing amount of confidence in our ability to give significant,as Rich's comment was in his wrap-up, margin improvement in 2011, Q4, more to come in 2012. Rich?"

The acquisitions, SMT and the size of that, and our new pension accounting going forward isratably and it is included in adjusted EBITDA. So, the table is one we would encourage you to study and come back. Profit and margin profile is a     function. It all begins with revenue. And we've demonstrated to you when we can grow the top line at an 8% to 10% level, and aggressively managethe cost control, we can consistently deliver between 100 and 150 basis points of margin improvement. And that's a function of many things,including prioritizing our investments. And I think we're keenly focused on doing that."

And of course, our goal is to deliver that or better for the full year. So, just think about wherewe are and then that full year delivery, Peter. But also a couple things that we've mentioned. We've spent the last four quarters investing in scale.We now have three Centers of Excellence globally. We're rolling out Vanguard to almost half of the business right now, and sales force automationtools everywhere. To your question about how things grow in scale, what I mentioned is we're starting to see the benefit of those investments, significant ones overthe last four quarters, in the top line. We're seeing it begin to drive our growth, and we're going to increasingly see it drive efficiencies. We haveanother four quarters, as you know, of Vanguard deployment, of Newton, and sales force optimization tools in process. Those will help us all theway through the year, and as Jerre said, into 2013. So, we should expect to see the benefit of that scale, some additional efficiencies build throughthe year. So, that's what you should expect to see on our margin goals."

I'm not sure which one's which here though, so let me just start. On Peter's question, just to clarify the guidancefor '12, you did 32% margin in the fourth quarter. The '12 guidance is 32% or better. Is the expectation in Q1 or Q2 to be down from the Q4 youjust did, but still up year over year? I understand what you're talking about seasonality of the profit distribution, but can you talk more specificallyabout the expectation of margin ramp? Then I have a follow-up."

The answer is yes to your question. Yes, you're right on. And if you do that analysis, again, using that 21% Q1 ofour guidance EBITDA, 30% Q4, you'll get there. And you'll see a number that we'll do our very best to deliver in Q4 that is a significant improvement.But Scott's point of 32% all-in year over year versus the 30.2% in 2011 gives you a pretty good thought. That's 180 basis points for openers. Now, the next clarification -- or your question."

I appreciate the slides on the pension changes. Perhaps this might be better offline, but the $57 million contribution,or however you're defining it, you talked about some buyouts and other changes that might occur. Is there an additional expectation of cash thatwill be done throughout '12, in addition to that?"

Just so we're clear though, and it's a good question, Michael the answer's no to that question. So we're clear, we arehappy to take as much time afterwards on one-on-one calls, or anything else that we need to do, along with that deck that we put on the website.And we'll also send that deck out to you, all of our investors, right after we finish this call, to make sure we do the clarification.

One, the fourth quarter rate is clearly an anomaly that's driven entirely by the pension adjustment. I think if you normalizefor that, the fourth quarter GAAP rate was 24.2%. And an adjusted tax rate at about a 27%, 28%, as well. So, really the combination of the discreteitems for the total year, and in the fourth quarter in particular, created a lot of noise in that metric."

It was a shame on us, or me, in Q3. We actually had quite solid subscription-based organic growthin Q3 in EMEA, 6%-plus. We didn't do our colleagues justice there because it was the transaction stuff that pulled it down to the less than 2%. So,it was good and solid and significantly increasing in Q4. And Scott, you'll love giving him color on that."

Just as we said through the year, despite a challenging environment, we're focused in the right markets on theright customers. And of course, bringing a lot of value to their operations. And we talked about the headwinds, and really seeing the bottom interms of, for example, defense and security. And that's what's played out. So, really solid double-digit subscription growth that's pretty broad-based,Bill. Strong performance in energy. Very good performance in terms of defense and security. And then I would say the other areas that really performed well, performed well globally. So, chemicals performing very well. TMT, supply chainsaround manufacturing doing quite well. And then transportations, and particularly, autos. And also, we had really solid growth in the nonrecurringparts of the business in EMEA. And the last thing I would add is the strategically managed account program.We had a lot of great wins across thosemarkets, and good performance as we connected with very large customers, as well."

We've talked in the past about inefficiencies as high as 30% to 40% in the sales force. So, we'll see several thingshappen. Shifting resource and focus within the existing sales force and our sales costs to emerging markets. And we saw that last year. We'll seethat continue. Latin America, as well as APAC, where we have high opportunity and high growth rates. We'll also see Vanguard roll out throughthe year. And what that does for us is it starts to give us a consistent view of customers globally, and then connects with our sales force automationSFA tool. We've got about 95% of the sales force on SFA, and almost $1.8 billion in sales opportunities flowing through that system. Another thing that I'll mention quickly is we've got all three Centers of Excellence up and running in terms of order management. So, quote, all theway through delivery. And we'll see that make the sales force more efficient as we move through the year. Probably the most of that benefit willstart to come from the back end as we get Vanguard fully deployed and we get people up in those Centers and fully trained. So, we'll see the benefitcontinue. We saw it some in the last quarter. We'll see it increase through the year, and then strong benefit in 2013."

But on the organic growth rate for revenue, is there anything technical we need to be aware of as we head into1Q and through the year that could cause that to accelerate or decelerate? Like, for example, in 4Q the anniversary effect certainly helped. And asI think about the quick cadence of the acquisitions you had in the year you just completed, SMT is by far the largest. And so, should we be expectingan acceleration baked into your outlook in 4Q because of that?"

I'll start, and have Scott pick up on that. And I'll go back to pick up a bit on Suzi's, too. We look at some30 different product revenue bases, actually daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly. If you'll remember, Scott said in the last two calls that 85% of ourrevenue was exceeding 10%. It was actually in double-digit organic growth. And that doesn't include the acquisitions we've made. If you add thosein for their own internal organic growth, it's actually north of there. Just for color, to give you a view, we range anywhere from 22%, 23% organic growth in a given quarter on some product lines to flat or thereaboutsnegative on some of the other product lines. Scott mentioned in his call, on the formal part of the call, what we're doing in having a continuingeffort looking forward to those that are not meeting our double-digit goals on organic growth. And how we'll review those businesses and products,either to increase spending to get them into double digits or make other decisions.

So, Jerre's told you wehave a great part of the portfolio that's in double digit today. You heard us say in terms of acquisitions that their year-on-year growth rate onaverage is about 16%. So, they're performing very well.What I would say is, as we've said for the last few months, we feel good about the foundationof the business. We continue with the highest level of transformation as we continue to roll out Newton, and staff our Centers for order entry allthe way through delivery. And we're mindful of the economy that we're sitting in. So, we're balancing those factors with, I think, what is a strongfoundation to the year, and a plan that we believe we can deliver."

We're relentlessly focused on those 1,000. And as I said, there's a differential growth rate in thoseaccounts. Extra 6 points, 6% of customer delight in those accounts, and 2 to 3 points of organic growth in those accounts. We're expanding them     to 250. We've just made some changes, as you've seen. Announced a new global sales lead, a single global sales operations function. And the goalthere with SFA is to get laser focused on those 1,000 accounts, and to continue that momentum. The other thing we're doing is the transactions part of our business, all the way at the other end of the spectrum, has been an under-performer.We've got great valuable information globally, and so we're investing in that this year.
