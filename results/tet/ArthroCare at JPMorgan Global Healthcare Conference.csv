1,18608673,ARTHROCARE CORP.,01/09/2012,5:00PM,ARTC,ArthroCare at JPMorgan Global Healthcare Conference,David Fitzgerald,ArthroCare,President and CEO,False,True,False,"Thank you. Good morning, everybody. This is our forward-looking statement disclosure and today my comments may contain forward-lookingstatements. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will provide a high-level introduction of ArthroCare for those of you who are not familiar withthe Company, followed by a broad review of the performance for each of our businesses. ArthroCare is basically a surgical device company with instruments and implants that enhance surgical techniques and procedures to improvepatient outcomes. Many of our devices use our internationally patented Coblation technology which use RF energy to precisely ablate tissue andwhile limiting the damage to surrounding healthy tissue. We conduct our business through two core product areas, sports medicine and ENT, which together comprise 95% of our product sales. Ourproducts are the standard of care for soft tissue shoulder procedures in sports medicine and tonsillectomies in ENT. 2011 has been a notable year of significant structural change for ArthroCare. In April we announced that we would close our Sunnyvale, Californiaoperations and relocate its activities to a new corporate campus in Austin, Texas. At this time the campus consolidation effort is complete and weare fully operation in our new Austin campus. We believe this is in the best long-term interest of our business and we have already seen an increase in ease and communication, improvementsin the alignment of corporate priorities and improvements in daily operation. We also expect this program will reduce our costs. At the end of the second half of 2011, we began the initiative to progressively increase the employee portion of our America Sports Medicinesalesforce over the next couple of years. As a result of this initiative, product sales can be negatively affected in the short term and in the thirdquarter, our product sales to stock distributors in the United States were about one million lower than in 2010. But our goal is to improve the performance of the Sports Medicine sales organization particularly in regards to how we market new products andtechnologies in the future. Over the timeframe of the next couple of years we expect to shift from a 30% employee and 70% agent to something more approaching a balanced50-50 mix. In July, we entered into a supply agreement with Wright Medical which will combine our OPUS fixation technologies with Wright's leading footand ankle distribution organization. We are optimistic about medium-term growth opportunity that this supply agreement presents.     Finally, bringing closure to our remaining contingencies have been a goal for our leadership team. In February, we announced a settlement withthe SEC that fully resolved the SEC investigation of the Company that was first announced in July of 2008. As we announced in late November, we have also reached an agreement in principal to settle all private securities class action suits pending againstus for $74 million. This settlement is contingent on final documentation and court approval. We expect to fund our settlement obligation in thefirst quarter of 2012. On December 8, 2011, the court granted final approval to a settlement in the federal court and state court derivative actions that were pendingagainst us consistent with the terms that we previously announced.With regards to the other remaining contingency, the DOJ investigation remainsactive and we are continuing to cooperate fully in the investigation. At this point, we do not know the timing nor are we able to estimate what aresolution to this matter will entail. Looking ahead in 2011, our product development efforts were largely centered around improving our product portfolio. In 2012, we anticipate agreater portion of our product developments and will be directed toward platform technology advancements as well as clinical expansion for ourtechnology. Today we are a Company known as an innovative leader within our core technologies. We own over 200 issued US patents and close to 200 issuedinternational patents. In Sports Medicine, we are working to expand acceptance of RF in the knee through clinical studies. In ENT, we continue to see the demand from clinicians to study the efficacy of the Coblation technology as part of the surgical treatment for patientswho suffer from sleep apnea and are not compliant with conventional treatment. This initiative is still under consideration. As we have previously mentioned, we are very interested in leveraging our US ENT salesforce in new areas such as sinus surgery that have the samecold point. We are also expanding our investment Asia-Pacific and we believe this region represents key opportunity for us. We're currently cooperating with the DOJ investigation and hope to bring this matter to a conclusion in 2012, resolving the last of the legacy issues. In mid-February, we will announce our earnings for 2011 and at that time we plan to announce our 2012 targets. Our 2012 targets will be focusedon the same core elements of shareholder value that we based on 2011 targets, those being revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. Thank you. That concludes my remarks for today. Thank you for your time and attention."
