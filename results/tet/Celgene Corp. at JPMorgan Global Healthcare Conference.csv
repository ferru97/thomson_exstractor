1,18609007,CELGENE CORP.,01/09/2012,4:00PM,CELG,Celgene Corp. at JPMorgan Global Healthcare Conference,Bob Hugin,Celgene Corporation,President & CEO,False,True,False,"Thank you very much, Geoff. Thank you very much and thank you JPMorgan for including Celgene at this important conference. Hopefully, todaywe will give you a great update on the very important results, very promising results of 2011. And also discuss those results and those achievements of 2011 and how they position us to capitalize on the multiple, multiple transformationinflection points that 2012 provides. I am very honored to be here today representing all the men and women of Celgene that are so committedto making a difference in accomplishing and advancing our mission and our vision. The presentation today does include forward-looking statements which actual results may or may not be as we discuss here today. Celgene is a company that has been transformed a number of times in many positive ways, but our mission and our vision is our constant. We arecommitted to building the leading preeminent, global, fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company drug discovery, development, andcommercialization manufacturing globally. And we are focused on discovering and developing innovative therapies in the areas of cancer andimmune-inflammatory diseases. This is a very important mission. It's one that unifies us as part of the Celgene team, and it takes committed, dedicated, and passionate people toproduce the outstanding results that we have been able to produce year after year after year. It is also, to us, the ultimate shareholder value creation proposition. The discovery of proprietary novel compounds in your own laboratories,developing them through your clinical operations around the world, and ultimately commercializing, retaining the full economic value for theCompany and your shareholders, is in our view the ultimate shareholder value creation proposition. And it's also an incredibly important, valuable business proposition in the world we are in today. It's extremely hard for me to believe that a companylike Celgene or any company can extract a fair return for the risks that it takes and the investments that we make without making a meaningfuldifference in the lives of patients in breakthrough therapies. So it's an important business proposition for us all. We have made and are continuing to make tremendous progress in building this market-leading company. We are beginning to see the promiseof a decade of very focused, intensive R&D investments, but also we are beginning to see the incredible benefits of the risk decision we made. Theinvestment we made to make Celgene a global company, to transform from a US-based company to one that today operates in more than 50countries with our drugs sold in more than 70 countries.     So as I close here today I want to leave you with a message that the state of Celgene has never been stronger. From an internal quality of our people,the commitment dedicated and the expertise that they bring to the opportunities that we pursue the opportunity for our products and what wedo the state of Celgene has never been stronger and the prospects of the future have never been brighter for us. We remain committed and true to our mission and our vision of discovering, developing, and commercializing breakthrough, innovative therapiesthat are designed to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients who are so tremendously underserved today. And we are true to thatcommitment. Want to wish you all a happy and successful 2012.Thank you for your interest and very much look forward to updating you throughout the courseof the year on our exciting 2012 results."
