You've sortof walked through some of the components of maybe what's changed. But maybe if you can elaborate what has changed betweenthen and now, and more specifically on the outlook, given what you're seeing right now, should we expect potentially more dilutionfrom any further asset sales on Genesis?"
2,64389341,WELLTOWER INC,02/22/2018," 3:00PM, HCN",Q4 2017 Welltower Inc Earnings Call,Shankh Mitra,Welltower Inc.,SVP of Investments,False,True,"So Vikram, I'll tell you that a few things have changed, right? If you think about Genesis, management has done an extraordinary jobof bringing all its credit parties together, just not real estate owners but all the credit parties together to get to a point of a sustainablecapital structure. That's extremely important, which we thought they're making progress but they have really surprised us on thepositive side of (inaudible) $555 million of fresh capital into the business. So that's something financially puts the company in aposition of strength going forward. But more importantly, for our retained portfolio, as you can see, our portfolio now is obviously-- is a much smaller portfolio that is much more focused. It's PowerBack heavy, and we see, after a long time, as I mentioned, andstabilization of cash flow in that portfolio. So that's -- one of the other things have changed. So operating performance has changed,credit quality has changed. Now as you can imagine, that as capital allocators, we look at every asset on our portfolio is on sale, right?So we're looking at this asset quality that we own. We know the coverage. We know what the operating -- really, the operatingoutlook for those buildings, and we're thinking at this strategy, is it a buy, is it a hold, is it a sell. And I don't know the answer to thatquestion. Like every asset, the Genesis assets are also for sale at the right price. We retain complete flexibility and optionality goingforward. I'm not going to tell you that we'll not sell further. I'm not also going to tell you those asset will not be sold. So that's sortof the messaging as we change when information change, when facts change. And Genesis, today, is drastically a different operatorthan it was 90 days ago."

DeRosa,Welltower Inc.,CEO & Director,False,True,"And Vik, let me add to that, that we always look to enhance optionality in terms of how we manage this business. And the strongeststatement I can make to you is, because Genesis is a dramatically stronger credit based on this restructuring going forward, it meansthat Welltower is a stronger credit going forward."

I think you alluded to the fact that you're now in a position to sort of grow cash flow, grow earnings.Would it be safe to say that, assuming there are not too many changes from here on, and you keep things intact, would we -- wouldyou be in a position to actually grow cash flow AFFO and see very little dilution, if any, from Genesis?"

Whether we are in the seventh inning or eighth inning,I can't tell you that, but we're definitely, as everybody else, seems to be starting their journey will feel like we're at the very end ofthat journey.

DeRosa,Welltower Inc.,CEO & Director,False,True,"So I'll emphasize the fact that we made a number of tough decisions when the wind was at our back. We've never felt the wind lessat our back than we do right now. And I'm very glad, and you should be glad we did take those tough decisions when we did thembecause this is not the time to be starting that. So I want to emphasize, we do believe we're kind of toward the tail end of this journey,and we are -- that is what speaks to the optimism that you heard from everyone here on this call today about the future. We are veryoptimistic about the role that Welltower will play in fixing health care delivery. And if you redline certain sectors of the health carespace, or at least the nonhospital health care space, you reduce your ability to participate in this change which we believe will drivesignificant shareholder value in the future."

So on the same-store NOI growth, if you would go in and I guess not adjust it for the $35 million rent reduction,what's the post-acute same-store number and the overall same-store growth?"
10,64389341,WELLTOWER INC,02/22/2018," 3:00PM, HCN",Q4 2017 Welltower Inc Earnings Call,John Goodey,Welltower Inc.,Executive VP & CFO,False,True,"So that was the question, was if we've adjusted -- not adjusted if it was just as per the January 1 rent coverage, right? I'll describethat number for you. And I think it's -- at the midpoint, it's minus 12.25%, I believe. Tim McHugh - Welltower Inc. - VP of Finance & Investments     Yes. And for the total portfolio, Mike, it's positive 0.5% to negative 0.5%, the midpoint of flat year-over-year."
11,64389341,WELLTOWER INC,02/22/2018," 3:00PM, HCN",Q4 2017 Welltower Inc Earnings Call,Michael William Mueller,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",Senior Analyst,False,True,"Got it. Okay. For overall, okay. And then you talked about the pro forma Genesis coverages. What were the coverages beforehand?So how much improvement is there with all the transactions that have been announced?"
12,64389341,WELLTOWER INC,02/22/2018," 3:00PM, HCN",Q4 2017 Welltower Inc Earnings Call,Shankh Mitra,Welltower Inc.,SVP of Investments,False,True,"If you look at our coverage, we'd give you a range and if you look at the range and the sub, it will see that it was close to 1. And it'sa very important question, Mike, because if you think about the history of rent cut in this sort of rent-ry profile in this sector, you willsee that majority of the times, the landlords have taken the tenant back to sort of 1 coverage, did not give them flexibility to investin their business, did not give them flexibility to actually grow their business, and that's why they went back to where they started,right? So we absolutely did not want to do that. As Tom said, we're never afraid to take bold decisions. This was needed and thishappened. So we feel like, going forward, that you can feel a very significant assurance that we have taken -- we didn't kick the candown the road.     9     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

13,64389341,WELLTOWER INC,02/22/2018," 3:00PM, HCN",Q4 2017 Welltower Inc Earnings Call,Operator,NA,NA,False,True,Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
14,64389341,WELLTOWER INC,02/22/2018," 3:00PM, HCN",Q4 2017 Welltower Inc Earnings Call,Jordan Sadler,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division",MD and Equity Research Analyst,False,True,"So today's news doesn't sound exactly like you're recommitting to the skilled nursing business or to Genesis per se, but it does sound,at the margin, that you're willing to hold today rather than be a seller at an excessive discount. I'm wondering, one, if that's a faircharacterization. And then, two, would you be willing to invest incrementally in Genesis beyond the incremental term loan pieceyou're lending?"
15,64389341,WELLTOWER INC,02/22/2018," 3:00PM, HCN",Q4 2017 Welltower Inc Earnings Call,Shankh Mitra,Welltower Inc.,SVP of Investments,False,True,"John, if you think about a triple net lease, it's a credit, right? So with our credit significantly improved at the property level from acoverage perspective, as you also said, the most important thing is the EBITDARM coverage of about 1.7. And remember, managementfee is subordinate to the rent payment, right? And it is guaranteed by the corporate, so at every level you look at it, the 3 level ofstratification, it's materially improved. So I want to reemphasize that point. And I also want to reemphasize the point, the rent resetthat I talked about. So if you look at the demographics and negative supply, if you believe in the demographics, and you believethat nothing is going to change from a utilization perspective, there's going to be a crisscross of demand and supply, in a not-too-distantfuture and we will be able to recoup that $35 million of rent, as I said. Will we invest in Genesis going forward? We are, already are.If you look at, we have a PowerBack development, that's in progress, and we believe in that model, so if there are other opportunitiesto invest in that PowerBack hub and spoke model that Genesis drives its business from, we'll be happy to do that. That's no changefrom what we have done."
16,64389341,WELLTOWER INC,02/22/2018," 3:00PM, HCN",Q4 2017 Welltower Inc Earnings Call,Thomas J. DeRosa,Welltower Inc.,CEO & Director,False,True,"Jordan, you've heard me say consistently that we are not going to abandon this sector. Why do I say that? Because when you interactwith the leaders of health care in this country, which are the CEOs that run the major regional health systems, they all say they needa viable post-acute care option. The problems that the REIT sector has been dealing with were capital structures that were notsustainable given some of the changes that occurred in reimbursement. And as Shankh said, and I say a lot, you can continue to kickthe can down the road until you just keep kicking the can at the wall and it keeps coming back at you. What was announced lastnight and what we have -- are talking to you about this morning is a fix that needed to happen years ago, but the industry kickedthe can down the road. We have fixed the Genesis capital structure. It's not just Welltower. It was every one of their capital partnersand we brought in a new capital partner. I think that says something about the future of Genesis. So we are in the business ofmaintaining and enhancing optionality, optionality for where we deploy capital in the best interest of our shareholders. And sonothing has changed. You've heard me say this consistently, and I took a lot of stones and arrows for saying it, but I think our strategywill prove out to have been in the best interest of our shareholders."

No, that's consistent, I think, with the messaging you've relayed over time. So my follow-up is really on Genesis again. I don'tknow if this is for John, but specifically as it relates to guidance. What is the total loan forgiveness that you've either recognized in4Q and that you expect to recognize in '18 of the $400-plus-million or so you've got to Genesis -- you had the Genesis? And thenwhat's the embedded total interest income that's in the $4 FFO guide?     10     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

The answer is 0. We have not forgiven loans. We have reserved against thoseloans, so there is a significant difference in that. And two, hidden in your question is, there's something that I saw a lot of confusionabout. If you go back and look at our financials of our last 2 quarters and see what we've said, our entire Genesis loan book was inpayment in kind. We gave them as they were doing the whole restructuring for last few months. We did not go through a hard cashpart PIK payment today. We went from a complete PIK to a part cash, part PIK payment today. With that, I'll pass it over to John."
19,64389341,WELLTOWER INC,02/22/2018," 3:00PM, HCN",Q4 2017 Welltower Inc Earnings Call,John Goodey,Welltower Inc.,Executive VP & CFO,False,True,"Yes. And so I think on the pennies front, Tim's going to answer for you on the actual pennies recognized in FFO from Genesis loans. Tim McHugh - Welltower Inc. - VP of Finance & Investments     Yes. And so part of that answer is, and this is important to note, just on a few notes this morning, we are just recognizing cash intereston Genesis in 2018. So in our FFO guidance this morning, it's just the cash. And as noted in both Genesis' release and that's prior tothis, there was no -- these loans ticked from 11/15 to November 15 of last year through February 15 of this year. So if you look at thefull year of 2018, important to note, from January 1 to February 15, it was all PIK, and we did not recognize that through FFO. Sothat's roughly $0.01 of -- on a cash basis of income that if you went full year, full recognition we would have recognized. And thenfor the rest of the year, they're -- the PIK component represents about $0.05 if you're not recognizing through FFO. What we arerecognizing is about $20 million of interest income in our 2018 numbers."

So on the forgiveness piece, the -- I guess I'm confused because I'm reading the piece about the bridge loans, the $275 millionthey have -- you want them to repay no less -- (inaudible) continued to make progress to pay no less than $105 million of obligations.What happens to the $170 million? Tim McHugh - Welltower Inc. - VP of Finance & Investments     So the -- as part of the announced restructuring for both Genesis and ourselves this morning, is the commitment based uponcontingencies of having a financing partner step up in that $105 million refinancing. The remaining piece is assumed to be outstandingfor the rest of 2018. So that $170 million will be current cash paying. It is current cash paying right now because after February 15,it went back to cash paying. And the assumption our model is that $105 million is paid back around midyear and the remainingpiece of that real estate loan and the term loan remain outstanding for all of 2018 in our cash paying."
21,64389341,WELLTOWER INC,02/22/2018," 3:00PM, HCN",Q4 2017 Welltower Inc Earnings Call,John Goodey,Welltower Inc.,Executive VP & CFO,False,True,"And I think I'll just reiterate, Jordan, what Shankh said. We have not forgiven them loans we have taken a reserve against -- becausesome of this is collateralized that we have to test the collateral that's underneath the orders as us can imagine make us do that, andthat was the reserve that we've had to take relates to the collateral, not to a write-down or the loan that Genesis will, therefore, beforgiven. So there's a big difference as Shankh said, we've not forgiven the $60 million write-down."

Tim McHugh - Welltower Inc. - VP of Finance & Investments     The 5.2% is -- so the way that we calculate our in-place NOI is off of just our property NOIs. So if you think about as of the end of thefourth quarter what's currently in our supplement pre-rent cut is a 7% exposure to Genesis. The 5.2% is pro forma for the rent cut.So it's just that."

Tim McHugh - Welltower Inc. - VP of Finance & Investments     Yes. As well as the held for sale assets as of 12/31. That 5.2% is essentially our pro forma NOI exposure to Genesis after rent cut andafter sales.

I appreciate that. That's helpful. And then is the change in view on Genesis so much the improvement of credit but also theimprovements at the property level? I think you mentioned that a little bit in your comments. So I just want to understand a littlebit better what's changing at the property level or operational level at Genesis that makes you a lot more confident in the companythere in your assets?
26,64389341,WELLTOWER INC,02/22/2018," 3:00PM, HCN",Q4 2017 Welltower Inc Earnings Call,Shankh Mitra,Welltower Inc.,SVP of Investments,False,True,"So if you look at -- again, I want to emphasize the fact in our retained portfolio, there's a portfolio that, obviously, we're selling nowthat is transitioning out of Genesis as an operator. Genesis is -- has sold and in process of selling lot of noncore states. So it is importantto understand they are refocusing on their core market. Core market's why Genesis always has done very well. In our retained portfolio,which is, as I said, it's very PowerBack heavy, we're seeing cash flow stabilization after a long time. And we believe that if you thinkabout how this plays out, that we will be able to grow cash flow in the future. So that's one of the points, and credit is obviously veryself-explanatory. If you can look at the coverage, and you look at the EBITDA coverage and EBITDARM coverage, that's significantlyimproved above market coverage. And the corporate guarantee is extremely important here, which is today, with the Genesis is --if you look at the Genesis' debt to EBITDA, it got almost cut in half, that's definitely an improvement in the credit. So that's why wefeel optimistic. Again, as Tom said, we retain all of optionality, as in any part of our portfolio."

I would like you to look at our performance relative to our peers every year for last7-plus years that we have been in the RIDEA business. That will give you the answer, but it's really -- it speaks to the quality of theportfolio and the operators and micro markets. So we have invested -- sort of if you think about how this industry has evolved, peopleare mostly triple net investors, right? Even when you're investing in credit. Investing in RIDEA is investing in real estate equity. Thatrequires a different type of skill set, and we're the ones who have invested in technology, in people, in data analytics and assetmanagement. So you are seeing the impact of that pretty much every year, probably every quarter, and that outperformance shouldnot be surprising, but we're -- obviously, as I said, that if you look at over a period of time we hope that will give us a better cost ofcapital.

If you look at what happened is that we always said that you think about what we're doing, right?Effectively, Genesis management, as I said, pulled off an out of indiscernible] restructuring with all of its credit parties that you neverknow that will actually be able to get to the finish point, right? Finish line. Second, we absolutely did not think they will be able toget fresh capital of the size that they did from the entity that they did, so there's one point. You are always interested, Rich, as anobserver of -- a longtime observer of the industry, how the tree leaves are changing. I would like you to see what happened in thattime frame with Kindred and Humana, Welsh, Carson. You could see today what happened with, obviously, fresh injection of capital.I can't talk about a lot of other things because they're nonpublic in nature but things that are happening in the industry. So goingback to -- very specifically to your question, do we have the ability to do a transaction? Absolutely. Did you get the price that wewanted? Absolutely. Is that counterparty still around for us to do a deal? The answer is absolutely. So the question is, today, as weare thinking about it, at 1, 3, 4 coverage, with a company that is -- leverage has been cut in half, right? From a 7 to 3, is this group ofassets we have called a part of the portfolio, as you heard from John, right? The 10% of the portfolio, is there -- at that price is this abuy, sell or hold? That's what we think about for every asset class. I share the enthusiasm of the market participants have about 4.5cap asset classes that grows 2%. But think about -- at the end of the day, we are here as a capital allocator to make money. Despiteall the noise around Genesis, our unlevered IRR is double-digit. The math that is mentioned in low 4%, mid-4%, at a cap rate goingin with a 2% growth with a 12% to 15% CapEx, you'll never even get to 7%. We're here to make money for our shareholders. Andevery time we are making a decision as a group of assets to see, is it a buy, hold or sell? That's what we did."

Follow-up question is, essentially Welltower shareholders are paying for this Genesis lifeline. And I'm not saying thattongue-in-cheek, clearly, the fortunes of your tenants accrue to the REIT, so it is what it is. You did what you had to do. But goingforward, you kind of get into this risky thing where we don't want Genesis, we do want Genesis, we don't want Genesis. So if youwere -- ultimately were to sell more, it kind of changes the narrative. So is there some risk that you kind of put yourself into a cornerand almost have to commit going forward? Or you don't feel that way?     14     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

The only thing I can say is that you've seen the current administrationlook for ways to take some pressure off the post-acute care space with respect to litigation. So I think that we take some comfort inthe fact that there is a recognition that we have to drive individuals into lower-cost settings. If the government continued to try andput the skilled nursing business because of their reimbursement programs, then we would have a much bigger problem in thiscountry because people would be stuck in very expensive acute care hospital beds. I think there is a changing view in Washingtonand we hope that a rational thinking will prevail here. We need to drive people into lower-cost settings. The health care industry,the hospitals are still trying to deliver value-based health care in fee-for-service-built real estate. That doesn't work. We will -- oureconomy will hemorrhage if we continue to think we have to keep hospital beds filled. We need to drive people to lower-cost settings,and so that is why we have never abandoned the skilled nursing sector.

We will consider that if we think it's in thelong-term best interest of our business and the long-term best interest of our shareholders. But no, we will not redline the spacebecause of some confusion about what's happening in the industry that was largely due to bad capital structures. Certain peoplemade a lot of money when these post-acute care companies found their ways into the hands of REITs, and REITs until RUGS-IV hadwell-covered real estate, the world changed and what you've seen us do is fix what was a problem that we've been dealing with foryears.

We tend to historically underspend our budgets in the first couple of quarters andoverspend relative to the pro formas in the second quarters that come out roughly where we think. And so I think we do see somereinvestment in portfolios. I think we've said on a number of calls, part of having a great a balance sheets is we can drive growth outof existing buildings through CapEx. So as Shankh was saying, how do we look at capital, we also look at existing buildings on thebuy, hold, sell mentality for investing more capital. The capital doesn't come for free, as you're well aware. So I think we do addresscapital requests in that way.

And so just as a -- kind of one of the things -- eventhough we're working through all of the CapEx and (inaudible) might be out of commission while we're working through all of that,I can tell you that the rate of growth in the Vintage portfolio actually exceeds the average Welltower growth rate, which, as youprobably know, exceeds the market average as well.

We're expecting a low -- no, we're modeling a low 3% rate growth. That's -- obviously, we did4% rent growth in '17, low 3% rate growth, 50 to 100 basis points of occupancy decline and a 3% to 4% expense growth. But as Isaid, to give you the occupancy assumptions at the beginning of last year, but we got to the same results, actually better-than-expectedresults, using a different combination. So I would not -- if I were you, I would not assume these are all independent variables, right?And see where we end up, but we feel comfortable they will be in the range probably through a different combination. The ratescould be better, they could be worse, maybe at occupancy, we're thinking down 50 to 100. It could be worse than that or better thanthat but expenses could be better. So there are 3 levers that drive that number. So that's how I would think about it, not focus onone variable. And from a -- your other question was about how occupancy will trend. Obviously, given the flu, you'll see loweroccupancy at the beginning of the year, hopefully, which will ramp back into the end of the year. That's how -- usually, that's howseasonality works in this business anyway. So you'll probably see them more and more pronounced this year because of flu.     19     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.
