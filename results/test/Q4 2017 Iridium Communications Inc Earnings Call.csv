Desch,Iridium Communications Inc.,CEO,False,True,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Well we just completed a really great year, both in terms of our subscriber growth and the early successof our Iridium NEXT program. We're halfway through the launch program and the new satellite activations continue to go very well. To date wehave launched 40 satellites which represents 61% of the 66 new operational satellites we need for full service and we'll be launching the final 35satellites over the next few months to complete the constellation. Our NEXT Launch has moved around a bit, primarily due to the delays in the[Pause] Mission that should be launching this morning from Vandenberg. Right now, it looks like our NEXT launch will be the morning of Thursday,March 29, essentially 5 weeks from now, though we're still confirming that date. The 10 satellites for that launch are shipping to Vandenberg now     2     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

This launch again will use a flight-proven first stage.It will be the 10th flight of a refurbished rocked by SpaceX. We have history with this particular first stage. It successfully launched our third batchof satellites in October.     Following next month's launch, our cadence with SpaceX should move more rapidly as launch frequency is planned to increase to approximatelyone launch every 5 to 6 weeks or so. In fact, our 6th launch is currently scheduled for a quick turnaround at the end of April. That will be a ridesharewith the JPL German Gray satellites in which we'll utilize half of the payload to launch 5 Iridium NEXT satellites alongside the two Gray satelliteswhich will be mounted on the dispenser above ours. This rideshare has turned out to be a very efficient way to share the cost of a launch withanother organization, allowing us to place even more satellites into orbit than are initially planned. Specifically, we'll now be able to have 9 orbitspares rather than the 6 we had originally budgeted for. SpaceX is planning a busy year and from what we can tell, they appear very capable ofmeeting the schedule to finish our launches this summer.     Moving onto our business results, 2017 was another solid year for our company. We exceeded our full year guidance for operational EBITDA andcontinue to have positive momentum business development activities across both our commercial and government segments. Our total subscriberbase grew 14% leadership team fueled by strong IoT activations and this positive momentum was even before we've been able to take full advantageof the capabilities of our new constellation.     Our commercial business has received from much of the economic and currency headwinds that produced slower growth back in 2016 and weare now operating in an environment that's supported by new IoT partners and an improving competitive position in the satellite voice market,particularly in handhelds. We feel good about our market position, experience with our strong ecosystem of distribution partners. A weakeningdollar has also made our premium products less expensive around the world, just when we're nearing completion of our upgraded constellationto deliver optimal quality.     I also want to highlight the value and potential of our Push-to-Talk service which was important in storm coordination and recovery during therecent hurricane season and it continues to demonstrate its value for organizations involved in disaster relief.     A big bright spot for us in 2017 was IoT which continues to benefit from our alignment with large, growth ordinated partners. I'm really pleasedwith the success we're having with heavy equipment OEMs. They increasingly rely upon us for dependable real time connections as they improvethe management of their global fleet assets in vehicles. We also introduced Iridium EDGE in 2017. This product is attracting new customers toIridium and helping them to get to market faster with lower implementation costs. As a result, we're sitting on a healthy pipeline of demand forour IoT services and expect subscriber growth in 2018 to be in line with what we experienced in 2017.     Maritime and aviation are sectors where Iridium is coming into our own and will continue to grow as we deliver faster speeds over Iridium NEXT.While we've long been a player in the maritime crew voice and connectivity market, the broadband component of our revenue from this businessis still relatively modest at about $23 million per year, providing internet and VSAT companion service on about 8,500 ships around the world.Iridium Certus, which will be launched commercially in the next few months, will give us offerings with dramatically increased capability andthroughput. With significant industry growth tied to broadband services, we continue to expect annual revenue from our new Iridium Certusbroadband offerings will reach $100 million in the next few years. And that's across all industry segments, not just maritime.     In the second quarter, we are on track to commercially launch Iridium Certus service which will become the industry's fastest, most reliable andmost cost-effective L-Band broadband offering. In fact, we've completed our system and satellite testing and are in live operation in the field onseveral ships. Cobham is testing its new Sailor 4300 unit and Talus is testing its new Vessel Link antennas on ships in the North Sea and AtlanticOcean, and the service is working very well. It's reliable and achieving the targeting initial rollout data speeds and is demonstrating outstandingvoice quality. This testing on the rough seas and in actual maritime conditions is allowing our partners to tune their products, ensure the highestquality offering, and is helping them improve their installation procedures for resellers.     Why we aren't counting on significant revenue from Iridium Certus in 2018, we do expect activations to start building momentum through theyear particularly in maritime, but also with land mobile applications as the new Talus Mission Link terminal is introduced. We're also looking forwardto aviation terminals being available for testing later in 2018 with commercial service on aircraft starting in 2019. While we're getting a little later     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Our offering makes iridium a great standalone service or a perfect complement for KU and K-Band (inaudible) services,especially for distributors seeking to pair the Iridium Certus service with other technologies for safety and reliability. With maritime terminalsavailable in the second quarter, our VAMs and channel partners are actively promoting the service globally today.     We announced our initial distribution partners for land mobile and maritime earlier this month and they are a strong group. We will also beannouncing our first aviation distribution partners very soon. Across all industry segments we have aligned with premier business partners whoare excited to roll out this broadband offering. We expect Iridium Certus to set a new benchmark for global L-Band services.     Our enduring service to the US government is a great source of pride here at Iridium. Government subscribers grew 19% in 2017 illustrating thecontinued importance of Iridium voice and data services to the USG and we ended the year with a record 100,000 government subscribers. Ourlongstanding relationship with the US government has provided significant value for both of us. The government has enjoyed broader and morecost-effective use of Iridium's unique global services. Since our fixed price contract was initiated in 2013, the average cost per subscriber has fallenby 24% for the government, while its subscriber base has nearly doubled. We continue to engage in constructive dialogue with this valued partnerbut don't expect to have much to report on a new deal until it's completed either later this year or in 2019 if they choose to extend the currentcontract, the additional 6 months it allows.     Aireon continued to make progress in singing new customers and addressing their capital funding needs as they move to commercial service.They signed 7 new MOUs in 2017 and earlier this year finalized a long-term data services contract with ASECNA, the air navigation service providermanaging traffic in 17 states in West Africa. We expect the company to announce additional meaningful data service contracts in the comingmoments.     As you know, Aireon is creating a unique and powerful air traffic surveillance system that will revolutionize air traffic management. The FFA's andEurope's deadline for compliance with their ADS-B equipage mandates are less than 2 years away, and aircraft installations are accelerating. WithA&SPs managing the busiest North Atlantic tracts already signed up, along with 9 other ANSPs around the world, we are seeing the FFA continueits testing of the effectiveness of Aireon's satellite-based system. Most recently, the FAA and NavCanada each completed additional successfulflight tests on the growing number of new payloads in space. Aireon tells us the performance they are achieving is surpassing expectations,particularly with messages they've received from the test aircraft with very high fidelity. That's given Aireon and their customers a lot of confidencein the capability and quality of their service to provide better air traffic management around the world.     Now on a final but very important note, we have made significant progress with our credit facility lenders that should take the topic of liquidity offthe table as we complete the iridium NEXT mission. Tom is going to go into this in more detail about the transaction. Needless to say, I'm reallypleased with this resolution and where it leaves us as we enter the home stretch on Iridium NEXT. Momentum is an appropriate word to describethe state of our business today. I'm very excited about the strong progress we made on launching Iridium NEXT this past year and seeing the energythat continues to fuel our business and operational success. 2018 is off to a great start. I feel very good about the underlying strength of our business,the new broadband services that we'll soon launch in the satellite industry, and our positioning, the ability to build new relationships with premierchannel partners that can drive incremental subscriber revenue for iridium. Even with the financial goals we have set this year, I am more confidentthan ever in our business prospects and my team's ability to deliver on these commitments as we complete the Iridium NEXT mission.     So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for a review of our financials. Tom?"
3,64388867,IRIDIUM COMMUNICATIONS INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, IRDM",Q4 2017 Iridium Communications Inc Earnings Call,Thomas J. Fitzpatrick,Iridium Communications Inc.,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Chief Administrative Officer",False,True,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. With my remarks today, I'd like to start by summarizing Iridium's key financial metrics for the full yearand provide some color on the fourth quarter results. Then I'll walk through the 2018 financial targets we issued this morning, review our updatedlong-range guidance, and wrap up with a discussion of our liquidity position and recent activities there.     We were pleased to deliver another year of good growth in 2017. Total service revenue grew 4% and operational EBITDA exceeded our full yearguidance, rising to $265.6 million. This performance was driven by continued momentum in IoT and in part field by acceleration of business with     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters.

I'd like to point out that out net income for the quarter wholesale impacted by 2 nonrecurring items. The first was $150.9 million benefit in theperiod from the effect of the newly enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Overall, the net effect over the long term will be positive for iridium, particularlywith the lower corporate tax rate. The other was a $22.3 million after-tax write-off of payments previously made to our supplemental launchprovider, Kosmotras. You'll recall we moved away from this provider when it did not meet its obligations under the need for launch programcontract. Today we have 40 Iridium NEXT satellites in orbit and all the SpaceX launches scheduled that we need to get our remaining satellites intospace for the Iridium NEXT mission.     In the fourth quarter, operational EBITDA rose 4% from the prior year's quarter to $63.7 million while our operational EBITDA margin moderatedto 55% on higher SG&A driven by a yearend true-up in management incentives. For the full year, operational EBITDA margin was steady at 59%.     The commercial side of our business remained quite strong in the fourth quarter, generating revenue of $69.4 million. This is a 12% increase fromthe prior year's quarter and was fueled by momentum in IoT as well as incremental revenue from hosting fees and data services associated withnew Iridium NEXT satellites put into service in 2017.     Beginning this quarter, we're providing a new revenue breakout in our financial students for hosted payload and other data services which totaled$4.6 million in the fourth quarter. This added detail allows investors to track hosting fee and data services revenue generated form our contractswith Aireon and Harris as well as nonsubscriber base revenue from businesses like our satellite time and location service, ort STL, which becamematerial to Iridium this quarter.     Our hosted payload revenues include the Aireon data service fee and Harris data and hosting fees, both of which are currently being paid in cash.We have not yet begun to recognize the Aireon hosting fee, as no payment has yet been made. I'll discuss our 2018 expectation for this item later.As a reminder, while re recognized approximately $2.3 million in hosting fees and data service revenue for GAAP in 2017, these revenues wereexcluded in calculating EBITDA since they were less than the approximately $4 million in recurring Iridium NEXT expenses that we incurred duringthe year which were similarly excluded form EBITDA.     IN 2018, we expect recurring service revenue from hosting fees and data will exceed recurring Iridium NEXT expenses and both will be recognizedin into EBITDA.     Commercial subscribers grew 13$ year-over-year. Much of this growth was the result of a 23% increase in commercial IoT subscribers, whilecommercial voice and data subs rose 2$ in 2017. Commercial IoT added 24,000 net subscribers during the fourth quarter, pushing our IoT mix to59% of billable commercial subscribers, up from 54% I the year ago period. As forecasted, our government service business remained at $22 millionin the fourth quarter. Government subscribers grew 19% in 2017 illustrating the continuing importance of Iridium service to the US government.Total users ended the year at a record 100,000 subscribers.     The impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria fueled incremental demand for Iridium equipment in the fourth quarter. Revenue from subscriberequipment increased 18% year-over-year to 19.4 million while equipment margins were 42% compared to 36$ a year earlier. This increase wasprincipally associated with the elevated mix of high margin handsets compared to the year ago period. This mix should normalize with stormactivity now behind us. We continue to expect margins in the high 30s to low 40% area, depending on mix.     Moving to the 2018 financial guidance we issued this morning, we forecast operational EBITDA in a rage of $280 million to $290 million and totalservice revenue growth of approximately 10% to 12% for the new fiscal year. The key elements supporting this 2018 outlook are as follows. First,we anticipate approximately $25 million in revenue from hosted payloads in 2018. Based upon the continued successful deployment of IridiumNEXT satellites. Today, Iridium has approximately half of its new satellites in operation and will add to this total with each launch until we have all66 operational satellites later this year.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved. Republication or redistribution of Thomson Reuters content, including by framing or similar means, is prohibitedwithout the prior written consent of Thomson Reuters. 'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 705                Hosted payload revenues include both hosting and data service revenue from Harris Corporation which has largely already been received in cash,as well as hosting and data service revenue from Aireon. Aireon will pay the data service fee currently and the revenue will be recognized monthlyas satellites are deployed. Aireon's hosting fee, which is expected to contribute approximately $14 million in 2018, will similarly be recognized prorata as operational Iridium NEXT satellites are placed into service. This is provided that either Aireon's financing closes and the first installmentunder this financing has been made to Iridium, or upon the FAA making a positive decision on utilizing space-based ADS-B which we still expectin the second half of 2018. Aireon currently expects their financing to close in the second quarter of 2018.     The second are key to our 2018 outlook is that we expect continued strength in IoT and are forecasting double digit subscriber growth from thatbusiness line in 2018. Supporting this outlook are a number of high profile contracts, one this past year, including heavy equipment manufacturerHitachi, continued demand from Garmin and Caterpillar and ramping installations from partners like Komatsu, Duson and Honeywell that areoutfitting their equipment with Iridium to provide reliable, low latency telematics. Third, we expect revenue from our fixed price contract with theUS government will remain stray at $88 million in 2018. Our 5-year contract comes up for renewal this year and US Government has the right tounilaterally extend it for an additional 6 months.     Today we are updating our long-range outlook. specifically, we are narrowing our range for 2019 service revenue. We now expect service revenuefor the full year 2019 to be approximately $440 million. This revision reflects our latest estimate for the sales ramp of Iridium Certus now that wehave greater clarity on product rollout and partner marketing plans. We expect Iridium Certus revenues will reach $100 million run rate in late 2021rather than as we exit 202 as previously forecasted.     There are number of other factors that support this long-range revenue forecast. First, we expect continued growth in commercial services, especiallyfrom IoT data where subscriber and revenue growth has been accelerating. We believe that many of the new heavy equipment partners we haveannounced in recent quarters will have fully integrated Iridium's satellite solution into their manufacturing process and be activating their servicesat a higher run rate.     Second, we anticipate a renewal of the EMSS contract with the US government that will be favorable to both Iridium and the US government.Ongoing subscriber growth within the US government bodes well for our negation and should lead to a new contract that will be a win/win forboth parties. Third, we expect to recognize the vast majority of the $47 million in hosted payload revenue in 2019 based upon terms of our contractswith business partners Aireon and Harris and upon expected developments at Aireon.     We started to recognize revenue from hosted payload last year based on each operational satellite in the Iridium NEXT constellation and expectthat the full constellation of 66 operational satellites will be fully deployed in 2018.     Finally, in addition to Iridium Certus, other new products remain important catalysts for revenue growth. We're excited about demand for STL, aservice that we think will contribute meaningfully to sales, as well as commercial Push-to-Talk. Our commercial Push-to-Talk offering was effectivein recovery efforts following recent hurricanes and the California wildfires. We see a nice pipeline of opportunity around the world fort his service.The other components of our long-range outlook, which we also are reiterating today, include expectations for operational EBITDA margin ofapproximately 60% in 2019, negligible cash taxes through approximately 2020, peak net leverage of between 6 and 6.5x in the 2018 fiscal year,and finally, net leverage of approximately 4.5x as we exit 2019.     Moving to our capital structure and liquidity position, we've reached an agreement in principal with our BPI lenders which has been sanctionedby the French Treasury that we believe provides Iridium with ample liquidity into 2022 even in the unlikely event that we haven't received anyhosting payments from Aireon. The agreement contemplates that iridium issue additional debt and for the lenders to delay certain scheduledprincipal repayments under the BPI facility. The proceeds of any debt issued will be used to repay our Talus deferred payment note and to fullyfund the debt service reserve account or DSRA. The agreement would also be very flexible in that it provides Iridium with access to a portion ofthe DSRA if our projected cash balances falls below an agreed amount. We expect to file an 8K detailing the arranged with our BPI lenders once itis complete and expect this to occur no later than the second quarter.     I'm very pleased I think this deal. It's good for Iridium and fully addresses our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. Iridium remains optimisticin the expectation for hosting payments from Aireon this year, but feels it best to not rely on them for purposes of our liquidity. Given these pending     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

This expected debt raise would not materially impact our netleverage because the proceeds of the offering will pay down existing debt and the remainder will increase our cash balance.     As of December 31, 2017, Iridium had a cash and marketable securities balance of approximately $298 million. We anticipate total capital spendingof approximately $500 million in 2018. This spending predominantly reflects work associated with the completion of the Iridium NEXT mission. Inclosing, I feel very good about the progress we made this past year. Our company made tremendous strides in building new business relationships,generation strong subscriber growth, and replacing our legacy constellation with new satellites. We believe that the new debt deal that I justdescribed takes any liquidity concerns off the table and we eagerly await the final lunches of the Iridium NEZXT program and the financialtransformation it will bring to our company. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the Operator for Q&A."

It's just really more thetiming. Because it's really starting to more rollout this year and doesn't start generating a lot of steam until 2019. So the timing just seemed moreappropriate to narrow that down a little bit. We're feeling very, very good about the revenue generating potential for Certus and the market for itand our positioning within that. The government is kind of a small part of it. We're not expecting -- I mean we haven't finished that deal yet oranything here, but I mean how would you characterize it?"

Our cost structure doesn't change that dramatically in the coming years with the new services that we're providing and therevenues continue to grow. And that expands operating margins beyond the 60% and I know others are in the 70% to 80% range and we don'tsee any reason why we can't hit those kinds of levels as well.

Desch,Iridium Communications Inc.,CEO,True,False,"There seems to be some confusion in the market, or from people I've heard, that somehow think that competition is based upon sort of architecture,like LEOs compete with LEOs and GEOs compete with GEOs. You know, it's really more around spectrum and applications that people provide. Sotoday, we compete with a GEO, a major GEO network today, and LEO, I mean excuse me, OneWeb, SpaceX, those are all KU and KA-Band providerswho really are going to compete for those commodity broadband applications that are currently what today's KU and K-Band GEO operations areinvolved in. So I look at those as potential partners. L-Band has a very unique place in the industry. It has a lot of advantages, particularly a globalone like us. For example, an easy example is on aircraft where L-Band is used primarily for cockpit operational communications for the airlines andKU K-Band is used in the cabin. When any kind of new networks come along, I think they're going to compete for the cabin but they really can't beregulated and provide servicing the cockpit. So it really doesn't change the competitive dynamics. SpaceX has a very interesting network. I knowthat they're going to take some time to develop it. I think that they are really going to compete against wire line and cable operations. They needto if they're going to generate the kind of revenues they has. So that's not our area. So I see us as complementary to the new players coming intoLEO in the say wake way I see us as complementary to the exiting KU K-band plays in GEO."

Desch,Iridium Communications Inc.,CEO,True,False,"I don't think it has anything to do really with terminals or partners. I think it has almost everything to do with our latest view of how the market willramp up. Based upon the slightly later deployments of Certus than we originally hoped. When we originally provided that guidance, the broaderrange of guidance, we have expectations that there would be 40 to 50 satellites in operation sometime in late last year. And that Certus would beready and developed and tested and that we'd be really ramping throughout all of 2018 for Certus. And 2019 would be a big year. Now with thenumber of satellites we had in operation only now getting to here in the next month or two and Certus launching here in n the second quarter,it's going to be only a partial year in 2018 of ramp. And really more of the ramp is going to be start gathering momentum more in 2019. But we'renot -- we're happy with the devices that we've seen developed so far by our VAMs. We think they' are going to be really well received. They're highquality devices from very reputable manufacturers. You've seen the service providers we've selected on land and maritime. We've announced thosein the last couple of weeks, it's a great list. It's only the initial list, there will be more that we're announcing. I think you're going to be real pleasedwhen you see the aviation partners who are going to roll this out soon and that's an impressive list as well. So still a lot of excitement and thedevices are coming along fine. It's just more timing. It's appropriate to tighten up the guidance now knowing we're getting a lot closer to 2019now than we were when we gave you that."

Desch,Iridium Communications Inc.,CEO,True,False,"In the last year or 2, I think it's been marked by stability really in terms of our open port products. As you remember, we had some quality issueswith that a number of years ago. Those have by far been addressed to the extent that that product is, I hate to use the word bullet proof, but it'svery, very reliable and it's seen that way in the market right now. And we continue to have had strong shipments and kind of consistent netactivations each year for the last 2 or 3 years. Some of those, a number of those are standalone applications on what I'd call the value sort of platersthat look for instead of an always-on connection, really want to pay as they go. A lot of them are being installed as companion vehicles to VSATproviders to ensure they week where VDAT doesn't work or in regulatory environments like ports where they're not able to be turned on. Certainly,in polar kind of regions and actually getting a lot of services. The ARPUS have been pretty stable in the last year, probably in a slight decline justas prices have improved and as business service is stabilized to what I think the level that that service can provide. It can only go up to 128 kilobytesper second. What the new Certus devices going from 352 to 704 pretty quickly here in 2019, I think we're going to see ARPUS increase with thatproduct more applications, more standalone applications and of course it will continue to be a great companion device. So I think the competitivedynamics also have helped us in open parts. Partners want to deploy Open Port with their VSAT terminals versus other solutions for reasons thatI think you understand and that also has given us a lot of market strength."

With the 2018 service revenue guidance, I just wonder if you can just give us some of the puts and takes, what's going into that.How much of that is Certus and hosting? And then secondly, if you could just remind us on the timing of the expiration of the DESA governmentcontract and what gives you confidence that there will be a favorable step up for Iridium there?"

Fitzpatrick,Iridium Communications Inc.,"CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Chief Administrative Officer",True,False,"Sure. So I'm not going to parse out all the elements that make up our guidance, but we did indicate that hosted payloads is $25 million. A littlemore background on the Aireon data fee which is charged and paid monthly, it's based on a fee for each of the 66 NEXT satellites in operation. Thefee is impacted by a customer contract milestone which when cleared causes the monthly fee for operating satellite to increase form approximately$16,000 per month to approximately $28,500 per month per operating satellite. So our guidance assumes the lower rate in 2018, thus arriving atthe approximately $8 million number. And the higher number for the majority of 2019. So that's pretty detailed guidance on what we're thinkingas far as hosted payloads. You would observe as the IoT business grew 13%, grew revenue=s 13% and we don't see that stopping, so that's certainlygoing to be helpful. We think the Talus revenues will be up materially. We see stability in our commercial voice and data ARPU, you saw that in themost recent quarter. We view commercial voice and data ARPU as quite firm. And so that's kind of the analysis going into the guide. I would saywhat gives us confidence that we're going to get a government renewal is our sort of 20-year history with the US government. The fact that they'regrowing their subs at 19%, we think the outcome, as I said in my prepared remarks, will be a win for us and will be a win for them. And our part ofthe win is our revenues will go up.     11     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

There is roomthere to sort of recover a little bit of that in an unlimited environment which we continue to billion there will be. A lot of other positive things havehappened recently too. As you know, we just started shipping the first new secure handset that they've had in quite a number of years. Smaller,lighter, better. The distributed tactical communication services global is moving and there are more tactical radios on different platforms. Youmight have seen the announcement yesterday of a new platform for all of the basically aviation raised that the government uses called the RapidCones R210. Their ability to expand that. And then IoT is really expanding broadly in a whole bunch of areas in Blue Force tracking kind of applications,vehicle tracking, fuel monitoring, all kinds of other applications. So on all that basis we're not projecting large growth necessarily in this area, butsome growth is appropriate and still ends up bringing a lot of value to the government.

It could still turn out differently, but the general feeling between us is that what we've been doing for thelast 5 years obviously has worked very well. So maintaining that structure for kind of unlimited service for a very specific narrow band applicationsmakes the most sense. And the government really procures broadband services in a different way anyway. And that really shouldn't be an unlimitedservice, so it's going to be a more pay for use. Comsat by the way was the perfect choice. They are the primary vehicle today for providing broadbandto the, L-Band broadband to the US government. And given when you move into the broadband space, applications care more important thanthey are on the narrow banc side.

We've been by far, as the premium and I think highest quality and furthest reachingsolution, have done better than anyone else over the years. But as you know, people have made runs at us in the past with low cost devices thinkingthey'd kind of peel away a lot of customers and that hasn't been very successful. The floor though is shrinking. Certainly, we know one has kind ofmoved into becoming a spectrum arbitrager. And in fact, I'm not even sure they have new handsets anymore. It doesn't look like they've investedin a new handset. They're announced nothing nor do the channels know of anything. I don't believe they even have new handsets to sell. Another,as you know, a regional operator in the Middle East has not figured out what its future is. And really, the partner abase ad customer base knowsthat they may be timing out. So I think their revenues are declining as people are afraid to make major new commitments to them for handsets.So essentially the floor has shrunk to 2 and that environment is well understood and we don't see anybody else kind of coming along there. Evenas we've been adding new company. Push-to-Talk has been a new adder in the last couple of years and there's a really pretty broad pipeline aroundthe world for lots of -- Department of Emergency Services and MODs and others who like PPT and we see the aviation segment just introduced aproduct for PTT, Latitude is going to provide it for like medevac and other kind of applications in aviation where Push-to-Talk makes sense. So allthat kind of goes to say that why we're seeing so much stability wright now in that space as opposed to couple of years ago where it was slightdecline over time.
