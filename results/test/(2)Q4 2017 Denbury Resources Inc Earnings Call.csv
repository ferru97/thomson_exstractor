Rezvan,"Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division",MD of Americas Research,False,True,"I got a few here. I guess I'll start. The Cedar Creek Anticline EOR decision. Chris, you've repeatedly put out a first half '18 event. Andthen the slide deck has language saying that the company's looking to establish a path forward. Given that we're at the end ofFebruary here, the first half is only 4 more months, can you give any color on kind of where you stand or what you're pursuing? Orhow that possibly could look getting to FID there?     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

So the way back I think about these, first of all, it's just such a great target upwards of 300 million barrels of potentially EORresource up there, which is well in excess of our total current proved reserve base. So it's something that you really want to chaseafter. And what we're doing, even through the downturn, we've kept the permitting process, which is really the main time impacton the whole project. We've kept that running through the downturn. And I think, what I see us heading towards is a confluence ofgetting the permitting resolved to a point where we can proceed, and we're feeling pretty good about that in the first part of thisyear. Getting the technical work and getting that piece of done, and that's every bit of that that I've seen as we've come through thelast couple of quarters, is starting to come to a head. Again, with this objective of getting that landed in the first half of this year. Andthen, the project work and taking into account some of the learnings that we've picked up over the last few years and reducing --optimizing the cost of our facilities and making a fit for purpose-type of development on the facility side. That's all coming together,very focused on getting that decided the first half of this year. And then what I see is that would put us in a position to have the pipe,which is a major single investment late in 2019, get injection started in '20 and then see first production in '21. So that's the frameworkthat we're seeing there, Tim. And I think that, at least everything I've seen so far, is very positive."

So are you -- are there plans that you might -- that you may go ahead without really looking for a partner, some kind ofthird-party capital infusion on the project?"

Kendall,Denbury Resources Inc.,"CEO, President & Director",False,True,"No. One piece that I didn't mention in my description there is that we're looking at how we fund that and some different optionsthere. Honestly, we'd prefer not to take the chunky capital of the pipeline in 1 year. We have a lot of other very nice projects we'dlike to do with that. And so part of the process we're working through the same time is exactly that, is looking at different paths forbringing in some outside capital for doing that. And as you mentioned, that is a great type of business that, I think, people areinterested in investing in. And so that's something that will happen along the same time and to some degree, perhaps, even beyondthe first half of the year, but I don't see any risk associated with that."

You talked about marketing some of your mature assets. Itlooks like production a little over 7,000 a day on that. Was that a separate decision from possible funding CCA? Or others kind of --do you see those as integrated decisions?"

That really -- looking at our portfolio is something that we should be doing every quarter, everyyear, and making sure that our portfolio makes the most sense for our priorities and where we want to deploy our capital and,honestly, just our focus. So they are separate, but I do see that at the end of the day, we're -- there's going to be a question of proceedsfrom that sale, what are you going to do with those? And we're very open with where that'd be deployed, whether it's into reducingdebt, into the assets and something like CCA or doing something else with it. But that is a possibility, but they were arrived atseparately really just makes sense for us to look at these assets and get our portfolio as optimized as we can.     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Rezvan,"Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division",MD of Americas Research,False,True,"Okay. Okay. If I could switch, and this may be a better question for Mark. The 4Q '17, the unit expense profile was very strong. But if-- I can understand it from the prepared comments, you expect LOE to up to about $0.50. Should we think about that as $0.50 fromthe full year 2017 average, which gets us closer to kind of a 21 level? Or is that from the 4Q '17 kind of level?"

Obviously, there's a lot to be gainedfrom continued focus at the field level on what we can do to improve that, and we're continuing to work other paths to improvingit. Honestly, optimizing our portfolio will do that to some degree, growing our production will do it to another back. But to framethat, I think, you're right looking at the full year."

It sounds like the Houston real estate sale it may not be one package but it couldbe multiple packages. So is that something that we should maybe just we'll get in like little pieces throughout 2018? Is that howshould we think about that?"

Allen,Denbury Resources Inc.,"Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary",False,True,"So what -- the way we think about the real estate sale in Houston, Tim, is 2 distinct parts. First, the area in Conroe there that's nearThe Woodlands, south of the town of Conroe. And that is one main parcel or one main piece of real estate that's broken up into 7parcels. And all of those parcels are going out for an RFP on March 1 of this year. So just a couple of weeks from now. And we expectto have bids in that by the end of March and see some notional -- we expect to get some purchase and sale agreements executedin the second quarter. So that's something that, I think, you'd see something from us in the second quarter. Then as we move southto Webster, that this multiple different parcels. Just the nature of their real estate there along the frontage road, on I-45 going downto Galveston, there are many different nice things we can do with the -- with that property and that will be something that I thinkyou'll see starting to come in over the course of '18, and might even be beyond that. But there's a lot of interest, a lot of good thingshappening there. Kind of 2 different things. A big piece in Conroe that we'll see some numbers on in the second quarter and thenthe rest of it in Webster that will happen throughout the year here."

So we have 1 well that's been producing for really less than2 months now. Certainly, we're pleased with what we've seen. We want to get more time with the well that we've drilled.

If you look at the map that we've provided for the MissionCanyon area that we're drilling right now, as I mentioned, we've already spudded the second well on that same structure. And wereally don't see anything different that we expect in the next 2 wells in terms of where we are geologically and what we're lookingfor. It's more of just testing the same concept and the same accumulation and establishing some production history. As we moveoutside of the Pennel and Coral Creek area, which is one of these first wells will be, then there're some different ideas that we'regoing to be testing, but again, all of it is generally the same concept with this fairly narrow interval of Mission Canyon. It's veryproductive, and we have some good running room across the CCA area with it."

Kevin, if you across the inset map we have there, we have the initial wells in the Pennel, Coral area and then we have thosered ovals highlighting some other opportunities that we see in our leaseholds that are outside of those fields."

And on Slide 17 you kind of -- I'm just hopping back to your capital plan. I just wanted to see the cadence of your capitalprojects throughout the year. I know you list quite a few tertiary and non-tertiary ones there. I'm just trying to see how lumpy itmight be towards the end of the year, et cetera?"

Kendall,Denbury Resources Inc.,"CEO, President & Director",False,True,I -- just off the top of my head. I don't think that there's any particular jump or drop in capital as we go through the course of theyear. The exploitation piece is working now and will continue. The Bell Creek Phase 6 piece is working now and will continuethroughout the year. So I see it being fairly flat as we move across the year.

Yes our leverage metrics have been higher than we would like and we're starting to seethose move here in the right direction.

I'm curious if you can talk about what the, what kind of decline profile you're seeingand you expect to see in this well? When I just look at your current EOR and the rate, the way those 2 fit together make it seem likeit's a pretty high decline well. But I wanted to just test that because we've gotten to the point -- we've answered the question aboutor maybe addressed the question of how repeatable that is, but also how good is this? So can you talk about how -- what you'reseeing in 2 months of decline on this?"

So what I'd say, Charles, is that first of all, that the EOR that you had seen that we disclosed publically was a predrill expectationso there's going to be some adjustment to that as we go. I would still say it's early days on how this behaves. But if you think aboutjust the nature of putting a long lateral in a pretty thin reservoir, we'd expect it to behave, honestly, more like an unconventionalwell where you have some fairly high initial decline rates. We're going to keep watching that. We're not to the point where we haveenough of a track record out here with it to really talk in too much detail. But what I would say, look at it to be along the lines of whatyou'd expect more in the unconventional side with the benefit of these wells being that we are completing open hole without offrac and the cost associated with that."

Thank you. If I could ask also about -- if you could talk a bit more about the exploitation you're doing atTinsley and this Parise Sand. Did I hear you right that is one of the traditional field pays that's maybe under CO2 flood in differentparts of the field? And are you guys planning on going at this with a being frac?

So what's interesting about that and it's even -- it even applies back to the Mission Canyon, Charles, is that these -- certain ofthese reservoirs, when we produce them on primary, when that's complete, they set themselves up very nicely for CO2. And that'sthe case with Mission Canyon, and that'll be the same for Perry. With the Perry, it's an area of the Tinsley Field that we don't haveperm for traditional vertical wells to really do a great job of sweeping with EOR so we have a lot of residual oil left in that horizon.And that's why we're going to attack this one with the horizontals again. We are going to have to put a bit of a frac in these, we think,to get the rates that we want. So it'll be a little different, although just if you kind of balance the whole nature of the -- of that fieldand the depth of the reservoir, our well costs are going to be in the same ballpark as what you saw with Mission Canyon."
