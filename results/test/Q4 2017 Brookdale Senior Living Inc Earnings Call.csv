How are you thinking through that? And thatwas big area of focus during strategic review process. Are you still working towards reducing the barriers related to those consentprocesses?"

That makes sense. And then just on the numbers, I don't know if I missed it, but did you mention on your outlook for month-- annual rent increases, both in-place and the improved mark-to-market place? How are you thinking about where rent increaseswill shake out for 2018?"
6,64389422,BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, BKD",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,CFO,False,True,"So we didn't provide specific guidance for our rent increases, but we do expect to see normal in-place rent increases. And we expectto see continued pressure on mark-to-market on our same-store communities."

So actually, on the last question partially, because on the Slide 18, I guess, you talk about the expect -- marginexpansion in 2019. So should I read into this, so you're trying to say that, I guess, and your comments kind of suggested becauseyou said '18 will be a challenging year, so we should think about sort of not seeing margin expansion in 2018?"
9,64389422,BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, BKD",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,CFO,False,True,"That's correct. It will be a difficult year, but we expect to return to year-over-year growth in 2019."

So was it for the full year '17?"

Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,CFO,False,True,"We are close to 6% in the fourth quarter and over 5% for the full year.

And then, you also said that in also the -- one of the slides, talk about reducing or rather realigning how you spend yourCapEx, right? So you have this metric here when you kind of talk about, it seems the recurring CapEx or the community level CapEx.So can you maybe flush out your view in terms of the different buckets for your total CapEx? Also Program Max and EBITDA, enhancingCapEx and any piece of corporate versus recurring, how can you -- so how should we think about it for next year or maybe the nextcouple of years in terms of changes versus Q4, for example?"
13,64389422,BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, BKD",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,CFO,False,True,"So Joanna, we're not giving formal guidance in this call, but what I can say with regard to our community level CapEx, on a same-storebasis, it's not going to be terribly different than 2017. We are expecting to increase our Program Max investments. And as you know,we think Program Max is something that drives a lot of value for our shareholders. We normally see double-digit returns on thoseprojects and so we want to invest more there. I will also say that in 2018, we will have hurricane-related Capex as we finished cleaningup the damage in Florida, primarily from the hurricanes that hit their last year and some extra onetime CapEx potentially to respondto the new legislation that's in process for Florida generators."
14,64389422,BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, BKD",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Joanna Sylvia Gajuk,"BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division",VP,False,True,"Right. So I guess, on that front, so you said it -- you plan to increase the Program Max because that's where you see the highestreturns. So what are the some of the examples of projects that you mentioned that you will try to, I guess, walk away from, so tospeak, or refocus this spending. So is it the cap exposure? Or is it something also that's could on the operating expenses? So anykind of examples you can give us in terms of things you -- as of now, you decided to kind of reduce exposure because what I'mgetting at is, is there something where you kind of considering maybe reducing your Ancillary Services business at all?"
15,64389422,BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, BKD",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,CFO,False,True,"So let me take that question. I think there are a few questions in there. So first with regard to CapEx, we are not reducing the numberof CapEx projects we have by any mean. In fact, with Program Max, we're increasing the number of projects that we have underway,but as you think about the impact of projects on the community, our objective is to reduce well-meaning initiatives that are impactingour communities. So if you think about it, there has been numerous, numerous department-driven pilot projects that consume thetime of our community leaders. We have and will continue to eliminate many of these. Regarding streamlining, one example thatwe significantly abbreviated was a 600-item questionnaire that previously each community had to complete. We're also improvingour decision rights. And so one of the focus areas that we have is we want our decisions to be as close to the customer as they canbe. So we're empowering our executive directors and that's something that's a pretty big focus for us. With regard to our AncillaryServices business, we think that's a critical part of our business and we think that it provides a differentiation for our customers asthey're able to get additional care within the same company."

So how did that occupancy trend by month?     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

18,64389422,BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, BKD",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,CFO,False,True,"So we were up in October and November and then we were down in December. Now in December, there are 2 things that werechallenges for us: the first was it was an unseasonably harsh weather pattern and the second was that the flu season started muchearlier this year than it normally does. Normally, we don't see a flu impact until the first quarter, but we did see the flu hit ourcommunities in Q4, particularly in Northeast. Now as I've mentioned, when there is flu in a community, we basically close thecommunity. And we do that to protect our residents. We also do that to make sure that we're protecting everyone. So when thathappened, we can't give tours, we can't move new residents in and so because of that you have an impact on occupancy."

And it seems like that occupancy is bleeding into the fourth quarter, and you had mentioned that the flu had really closed to-- down for about 1,000 days in that first 45 days in a month. So how has -- how's that occupancy trended in January? Can you puta number to it?"

Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,CFO,False,True,"I won't put a number to it, but what I will say is that in Q1, we normally experienced a seasonal decline. So Q1 is always, almost alwayslower than sort of Q4 and 2018 is no different than that. As you did mention, we are having a flu impact. It's the worst flu season forseniors as it's been in 20 years. And so that has an effect not only on our move-ins, but also in having an increased death rate."

As far as we know, the flu impact hasn't peaked yet. It normally peaks about this time, but we're still seeing prettyelevated path. When we get together on our next call, we'll be able to provide additional clarity on that for you."

And then just thinking about the strategic review process, what were some ofthe terms in that indicated offer that you mentioned that the board felt was unachievable or untenable?"

And I will say that we've already taken alarge number of the actions this week, in fact. Just to remind our G&A. Now a quick reminder, the $25 million is before normal costinflation and before normalized bonuses. Because we underperformed last year, we paid much lower than normal bonuses and ourexpectation is that we will perform in 2018 and so we will pay normalized bonuses."
