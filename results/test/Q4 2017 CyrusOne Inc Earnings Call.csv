2,64399826,CYRUSONE INC,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, CONE",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"President , CEO & Director",False,True,"Thanks, Schafer. Howdy all, and welcome to CyrusOne's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call.     We had a really good quarter and another outstanding year, putting up very strong results and continuing to grow our U.S. business organicallywhile strategically positioning the company to grow internationally. Since we just celebrated our fifth anniversary as a public company, I wantedto begin with a brief recap of our accomplishments over that period.     As Slide 4 shows, we have been consistently executing the same methodical strategy for the past 5 years, which is no different than what we hadbeen doing for the prior 10 years when we were private. Our strategy is simple. First, we have been and will continue to be maniacally focused onbeing the low-cost leader in the industry, being able to bring on megawatts of capacity at the lowest cost and fastest time to market, which hasenabled us to generate mid-teens returns and reduce our capital at risk. While a few have doubted our capabilities in this area, and despite ourwillingness to explain investors how we do it, I would just point out that many companies in our industry seem to now be constantly talking aboutcost savings, supply chain efficiency, modular building techniques and speed to market, which are all things we were innovating on for many years.So if imitation is a form of flattery, we are doing pretty well. Having said that, we believe there remains significant demand for quality data centerspace for years to come, and there is plenty of room for successful growth across our industry and our peer group.     The second thing that we do, which is arguably our greatest strength, is sell. We identified and targeted selling to enterprise customers many yearsago and have been incredibly successful targeting this segment. Three years ago, we believe that the cloud companies were going to change thedata center landscape, and we started focusing on those customers, 3 years later, we count practically every single cloud company as a customer,all of which are asking us to expand internationally with them.     Over the 5-year period since our IPO, we have stuck to these 2 strategies and have methodically grown and significantly diversified the business,expanding our portfolio across the entire United States. Over this period, we have more than tripled our revenue and adjusted EBITDA, increasedthe size of our real estate portfolio by 4 million square feet to a total of nearly 6 million and quintupled the value of the company. In short, throughthe tremendous effort of an incredible team and never veering from our course, we have basically exceeded every goal we had set out to achievefor ourselves 5 years ago and have been the fastest-growing company in our industry during this period.     Moving to Slide 5. Revenue of $180.5 million was up 31% over the fourth quarter of 2016, and adjusted EBITDA of $104.2 million was up 43%, whichwas one of the highest growth rates since our IPO. Normalized FFO of $0.84 per share was up 24% compared to last year. In the quarter, we leased9 megawatts of power and 86,000 colocation square feet, and our bookings totaled $18 million in annualized GAAP revenue, 10% below ourbookings goal of $20 million as a result of some deal delays for some very large cloud customers that pushed to Q1.     For the year, we signed 58 megawatts and more than 520,000 square feet totaling $105 million in revenue, an average of more than $26 millionper quarter, which is over 30% above our targeted quarterly close rate and well above our respective market share as measured by revenue.     As Slide 6 shows, we signed 20 new customers this quarter with the highest total in the past 2.5 years. Roughly 60% of our deals this quarter werefor smaller deployments, highlighting our enterprise sales focus, which resulted in an average price of $170 per kilowatt, which is 12% higher thanour trailing 4-quarter average and 25% greater than our trailing 8-quarter average when we had some very large hyperscale deals. We continueto sell well above our respective market share, and bookings for the year were equivalent to 18% of our base revenue, which will continue to propelour growth into 2018 and beyond.     As shown on Slide 7, we are continuing to see strong performance in our interconnection business, which generated $9.2 million of revenue in thequarter. This is up 20% year-over-year, which is one of the highest growth rates in the industry and reflects the changing network topology, drivenby hyperscale cloud deployments in our facilities, combined with the hybrid cloud deployments of our enterprise customers. As an aside, addingIX to our product portfolio has been the only meaningful change we have made to our product offering in the last 10 years and has been verysuccessful as measured by its growth rate.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Our sales funnel is the largest it's been in our history, up 9% sequentially and nearly 40% from a year ago, with 60% to 70% of itcoming from cloud companies, which are increasingly willing to outsource more of their primary data center needs to us, and we expect them tocontinue that trend as we expand internationally. Given the strength of our sales funnel over time, we decided to make substantial investmentsin our U.S. platform, providing us with additional capacity to grow. As of year-end, we had over 250,000 more white floor space available to sellthan we did last year across our key markets, which you may recall is when we were essentially sold out. Upon full lease-up of this built out whitefloor space, we expect to generate $100 million to $140 million in additional revenue, equivalent to approximately 20% of our 2017 base revenues.We also have another 1.5 million of built out shell capacity plus more capacity under development. Additionally, we purchased 44 acres of land inAtlanta in the quarter, which gives us a stronger presence in the Southeast and increases our total land bank to more than 340 acres, which shouldprovide us with adequate inventory to grow over the next few years.     In short, I believe our U.S. operations are performing at a very high level with strong demand coming across from both enterprise and cloudcustomers. We also have plenty of immediate inventory available and future capacity that we can build out, which enable us to grow in the U.S.market for the next several years.     Given our already strong position in the market, we will deemphasize investing more capital in the United States and redirect some of our capitalspend towards international expansion where we believe we have a better strategic opportunity to win more market share and, as we have provenin the U.S. market, achieve very attractive profitable growth.     Moving to slides 9 through 11. I wanted to recap our thinking on international expansion. Last year, I mentioned that by the second quarter of2018, we will have a sizable presence outside of the U.S., and in the fourth quarter, we positioned ourselves to do just that. Our focus on growinginternationally is grounded in the belief that in order to best serve our customers, we need to have a broader product portfolio. What we arewitnessing is that the biggest customers are buying globally, and a large part, these are the hyperscale cloud providers followed by enterprisecompanies. The demand is concentrated in the major global markets, and our 2 other U.S.-based global data center competitors are generatingsignificant demand in overseas markets from their existing U.S.-based customers, which we are effectively shut off from at this point because wedo not have an international presence.     Our approach to international expansion is to leverage our core competencies, including our expertise in design and construction, our best-in-classsales organization and our emphasis on providing unparalleled customer service. We will focus on the markets where demand is aggregating andpursue a dual-track approach to establishing a presence in those markets, including organic expansion opportunities as well as M&A.     In October, we announced $100 million investment in GDS, which is one of the most successful data center companies operating in China today.China is one of the fastest-growing data center markets in the world with the largest number of cloud companies outside of the U.S. It's also oneof the more challenging markets to do business in. GDS is a phenomenal company led by a great team that is culturally very aligned with the wayCyrusOne sees the world and works with customers. As of yesterday, our investment in GDS was worth more than $220 million, increasing over120% in value in just a few months. However, the primary reason we entered into this arrangement with GDS is because of the partnership we areworking on together, which will help our companies grow faster in Asia and the U.S. This partnership is working very well, and in a short amountof time, we have generated significant deal funnel that will allow our respective customers to grow in each other's markets, benefiting both ourcompanies and the customers that we serve. We expect to close our first deal with the Chinese cloud company this quarter.     We followed up the GDS transaction with the year-end announcement of the agreement to acquire Zenium, which we are very excited about.Franek and his team are experienced operators, and they have done a remarkable job building and growing that business. Similar to us, they havea particular emphasis on hyperscale cloud companies, which represent more than 75% of their portfolio and many of the same customers who areexcited about the opportunity to work with CyrusOne at scale in Europe. They have a total of 4 data centers in London and Frankfurt and very wellpositioned to capitalize on the demand I was just referring to with 22 megawatts of capacity available for immediate development and lease-up.     Europe has historically been an interconnection-driven market, but in the last couple of years, demand has accelerated and the size of the dealshas increased, in large part driven by the hyperscale cloud companies. This demand is concentrated in a few major markets, and due to the lack oflarger-format data center providers in those markets, it is being captured by secondary providers or interconnection-focused competitors. As weexpand organically, we will be able to leverage the management team. There is another site in Frankfurt under contract, and there are other organic     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Additionally, we anticipate achieving future costsynergies through the benefits of scale such as improved purchase economics and potentially through acquisitions as we expand into additionalmarkets.     Given the maturation of the European data center market, significant demand growth, particularly for larger deals and the positioning of Zenium,we believe there's a tremendous opportunity over the coming years. We hope to close on the transaction at the beginning of the second quarter,and would expect to have closed a number of additional deals by then as well. We estimate that Zenium's adjusted EBITDA will grow by over 80%next year. However, the bigger opportunity that we will acquire with Zenium is a platform that will enable us to acquire many other assets in Europe,which will be substantially more accretive as we will have an efficient platform to acquire them with.     In closing, we ended 2017 in a very strong position. We generated fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 31% and 43%, respectively,which are some of our fastest growth rates over the past 5 years. We increased our dividend an additional 10% and have almost tripled it over thepast 5 years. We also raised $700 million of capital in the quarter with leverage of 4.7 and ended the year with over $1.2 billion of liquidity, whichwill enable us to continue to fund our growth throughout 2018.     Given our strong fundamental performance this quarter as well as our peers, it's pretty astonishing that the REITs have fallen by 11% since thebeginning of the year and the data centers by an even greater amount, which are down by about 16% since January 1. While it'll be easy to concludethat the recent stock price performance -- that there are some bigger issues facing our industry, I think this is shortsighted. Our business isfundamentally just as strong today as it was 2 months ago. The growth in our business is driven by an outsourcing trend in cloud and enterprisecompanies, and as you saw from the recent record results posted by Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce, which grew between 40% to 60%year-over-year, this trend is not slowing down anytime soon and will continue to propel our business for the next several years.     While rising interest rates are not helpful for REITs in general, I would point out that the data centers are growing at considerably faster rates thanthe average REIT, in our case, almost 500% faster, and the best way to combat rising interest rates is through growth. Given where our stock priceis currently trading, we are offering a 4% dividend yield and just provided 2018 EBITDA guidance of 25% growth this year as well. There are notmany investment opportunities in the industry that carry this type of current cash yield with a very strong secular growth story attached to it, whichis why I believe that the longer term our share price and my peers will continue to do very well.     I will now turn the call over to Diane who'll provide more color on our financial performance for the quarter and our guidance for '18. Thanks a lot."
3,64399826,CYRUSONE INC,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, CONE",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Diane M. Morefield,CyrusOne Inc.,Executive VP & CFO,False,True,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. As Gary mentioned, we were very busy in 2017 and had another great year.     As Slide 13 shows, our growth in the fourth quarter was particularly strong. Adjusted EBITDA grew 43% compared to the prior year, and that wasthe second-highest quarterly growth rate since our IPO, while revenue and normalized FFO grew 31% and 39%, respectively.     The company's growth continues to be driven primarily by strong leasing execution in both the cloud and enterprise company industries and thegrowth of the interconnection business. In addition, our 2017 results included 10 months of operations from our Sentinel acquisition. Full yearchurn was 3.9%, below the lower end of our full year guidance range of 6% to 8% and the lowest annual churn rate since 2013. We anticipate thatour full year 2018 churn will be in the 6% to 8% range, consistent with our annual forecast for the past several years.     The weighted average remaining lease term of our portfolio is currently at almost 4.5 years, which has nearly doubled over the last 5 years. Overthe same period, the percentage of month-to-month contracts and up for renewal in the next 12 months has steadily decreased. We expect thatover time, this percentage will continue to decrease as our average new lease terms are longer than the remaining duration of our existing portfolio.     Turning to Slide 14. NOI grew 34% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by the increase in revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin was up 4.6percentage points and at nearly 58%, which was our highest quarterly margin as a public company. As we've discussed in past quarters, this     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 55                improvement is largely being driven by revenue growth without a commensurate growth in overhead. Normalized FFO increased 39%, whilenormalized FFO per share grew 24%.     As the chart at the bottom of the slide shows, the net impact of the adjustments to normalized FFO to arrive at AFFO was slightly negative in thefourth quarter and more in line with what we would anticipate without an elevated level of customer installations that impacted the third quarteradjustment.     Slide 15 provides an overview of the portfolio by market. As you can see, we have significantly grown our footprint over the last 12 months toaccommodate the demand we are seeing across our market. Our portfolio is very well balanced geographically and with our international expansionwill be further diversified. The table on the right shows that utilization for stabilized properties as of the end of the fourth quarter was 93%, 1percentage point higher than the prior year period. While total utilization declined 2 percentage points year-over-year, that still reflects strongunderlying demand, considering our colocation square feet footprint increased by 57% over that same 12-month period.     Slide 16 summarizes our development pipeline as of the end of the quarter, which includes projects in Dallas, Northern Virginia, Phoenix and Austinthat will deliver 163,000 colocation square feet and 39 megawatts of power capacity. Approximately 27% of the pipeline is preleased, and weexpect meaningful additional leasing to occur by this time this capacity comes online, given the strength of our late-stage sales funnel across thesemarkets.     In Dallas, we're building the seventh and final data hall at our Carrollton location and the first data hall at our new Allen location. In NorthernVirginia, we brought the third data hall online in our Sterling V facility, adding 81,000 square feet. And the fourth data hall, which is fully preleased,is currently under construction. Finally in Phoenix, we brought the first data hall at our Chandler V facility online, adding 72,000 square feet and itis currently 50% utilized. Upon completion of the project in our development pipeline, our portfolio will have increased 65% to nearly 3.5 millionsquare feet of raised floor from just over 2 million square feet at the end of 2016. In addition, the Zenium transaction will provide further upside,given the development capacity in their portfolio.     Moving to Slide 17. We ended the year with a conservative capital structure and really strong balance sheet with leverage of 4.7x. No debt maturitiesuntil 2021, a fully unencumbered asset base with a gross book value of over $5 billion and available liquidity, as Gary pointed out, of over $1.2billion.     During the fourth quarter, we raised nearly $300 million in our market equity program, and on a market cap basis, shareholders' equity representsmore than 70% of our total underpriced value. Our fixed floating interest rate mix is currently now more weighted to fixed rate debt at roughly60-40 fixed-to-floating debt at year-end.     Turning to Slide 18. As you know, we closed $400 million senior notes offering in nearly November, adding to the notes issued early in the year. Itwas a very successful offering, raising $200 million in both the 7- and 10-year tranches, yielding a blended coupon of approximately 4.3%, whichwas very attractive pricing. Combined with the March offering, we smoothed our debt maturity schedule and again achieved a better mix of fixedto floating rate. Our weighted average debt term now is approximately 6 years, up from a little over 5 years at the end of 2016.     Given our consistent execution, the scale and diversification of the business, the durability of our cash flows and our strong balance sheet, we arehopeful that we will achieve an investment-grade rating in the near term, consistent with many other REITs that have similar profiles to ours.     Turning to Slide 19. As Gary mentioned, we are increasing the dividend in the first quarter of 2018 to $0.46 a share per quarter, which is a 9.5%increase over the quarterly dividend rate of $0.42 a share in 2017. This represents over 4% yield based on our current stock price. The currentdividend is nearly triple of what it was in 2013, and note that 100% of our 2017 payout was return of capital, enhancing the after-tax yield forinvestors with taxable income.     When considering how to maximize value for our shareholders, we try to be very thoughtful in determining the optimal allocation between retaininga reasonable level of cash for our capital requirements, which drives our continued growth and paying an attractive cash dividend to our investors.     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Our revenue backlog as of the end of the quarter was $20 million. As shown on the bottom chart, we expect nearly 2/3 tocommence by the end of the first quarter and the remainder to commence in the following 2 quarters.     Slide 21 shows our guidance for 2018. We've assumed that Zenium transaction closes on April 30, and this timing is reflected in our outlook. Theguidance midpoint for total revenue reflects a 22% year-over-year increase, and excluding the contribution from the Zenium asset, revenue growthis anticipated to be in the 17% to 19% range.     While many stocks in the REIT industry have pulled back since the beginning of 2018 on the back of rising rates, growth, as Gary mentioned, is thebest way to combat these rate increases. And given our fourth quarter '17 performance as well as our 2018 guidance, you can see that our businessesshould continue to outgrow the impact of any future rate increases. In addition, if we achieve investment-grade, we will have a lower cost of capital,which will also combat increasing interest rate.     As I mentioned earlier, we expect revenue churn for the year to be in the 6% to 8% range, which is what we have historically forecasted. The adjustedEBITDA guidance midpoint reflects the 25% year-over-year increase. The implied margin, assuming the midpoints of the revenue and EBITDAguidance, is 56.9%, a 1.6 percentage point increase over the 2017 margin. The expected margin expansion is driven by increased scale, offsetpartially by additional SG&A expense we expect to incur for our European expansion as we build out the international platform. We anticipatenormalized FFO per share of $3.23 at the midpoint of our range, and I'll provide more color on this on the next slide. We expect capital expendituresto be in the similar range to last year at $850 million to $900 million. However, the mix will shift, as we show at the bottom of the slide. Specifically,we plan to spend approximately $300 million less building out facilities in the U.S. as a result of the inventory we brought online in 2017, and weplan to spend more on land in international markets versus domestic. It's important to note that only $20 million of our capital spend in 2017 wasfor land acquisitions.     Consistent with our stated expansion plan, we expect to spend approximately $300 million acquiring land and building additional data centercapacity in Europe as we scale that operation.     Slide 22 shows the expected impact of various investments to normalized FFO per share in 2018, assuming the mix of debt and equity consistentwith our stated financial objectives. As mentioned in the Zenium announcement material in December, we expect this transaction to be initiallydilutive, having a $0.13 to $0.17 range impact in 2018. However, the business for Zenium is growing rapidly, and in 2019, we expect adjusted EBITDAfrom this acquisition to increase over 80% compared to 2018. In addition, acquiring this platform with an existing experienced team positions usto acquire accretive transactions in Europe going forward.     As noted on the previous slide, we anticipate making a significant investment in land, positioning us for continued growth in 2019 and beyond,with these land investments having a $0.07 to $0.09 dilutive impact this year in 2018. Additionally, as Gary noted, we're in discussion with GDScustomers, but given the time it takes to sign and commence these large leases, at this point, we do not expect a significant contribution tonormalized FFO per share in 2018.     And finally, keeping in mind that we made a significant investment to bring inventory online in the latter part of 2017 across our key markets inthe portfolio where we're essentially out of capacity, the result of this year, the timing impacts associated with this inventory investment duringthe lease-up period across these markets is somewhat dilutive.     Excluding the impact of these investments, which position us very well for 2019 and beyond, we would have expected 2018 normalized FFO pershare on a pro forma basis to be in the low teens range from a domestic-based organic growth model. We are willing to take the near-term per-sharedilution to position CyrusOne for the next 5 years of growth, particularly in creating an international platform to meet the demand in those marketsfrom our existing customers, as Gary mentioned in his remarks.     In closing, we are really pleased with the performance across all areas of our business in 2017, and we are excited for 2018 as we continue to growthe company and position ourselves for our international expansion.     Thank you for calling in, and we are now happy to take any questions. Anita, if you could please open the line for questions.     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

4,64399826,CYRUSONE INC,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, CONE",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Operator,NA,NA,True,False,(Operator Instructions)     Our first question today comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
5,64399826,CYRUSONE INC,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, CONE",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Frank Garrett Louthan,"Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division",Research Analyst,True,False,"Can you talk to us a little bit about the preleasing trends, specifically on the CapEx number that you have and the likelihood of spending all of thatcapital? And then can you give us an update on the Atlanta property and remind us how much of that has been preleased and when we couldexpect to see some operations there?"
6,64399826,CYRUSONE INC,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, CONE",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"President , CEO & Director",True,False,"Sure. Frank, Gary. So the way we think about it is as we are coming out of '17, we were trying to bring on additional inventory capacity available inall the key markets, which we were sold out last year. In my prepared remarks, I talked about roughly 250,000 square feet of space available builtout now that we can sell into. If we were to sell out all of that and just deliver that capacity perfectly as customers would take it, we'd generateanywhere between $120 million, $140 million of additional revenue. Clearly, customers don't take the capacity in exactly as we build it out, so we'regoing to bring on some additional capacity towards the end of the year, depending on how customer demand warrants. So when you think abouthow much capital that we're going to be spending domestically, a lot of that is going to be conditioned upon sales that we expect to occur overthe beginning of the year. When Diane spoke, she talked about the different amounts of capital projects that we're bringing online and sharedinsight in terms of how much of those things are presold that we're building towards demand, and she also, in our prepared remarks, providedsome overview of when our revenue expects to come online. But when you look at, at a high level, we're going to spending about $300 millionless in capital this year. Just off the bat, that's going to be directed to Europe. And the remaining amount of that $500 million is going to be basicallysuccess-based as customer demand warrants over the year. With regard to Atlanta, and for that matter, the Quincy property is the same, that webought those to basically position those properties that we could be responsive to customer needs, that we could build quickly. So our focus is toget those permitted, ready to go and on the shelf when we have a customer in tow so that we could deliver that capacity for customers as demandwarrants. Those are going to be basically triggered by build-to-suit type deals where we're going to need about a 4- or 5-megawatt type buildbefore we kind of commit to putting something there. We've worked out our supply chain such that we can deliver that capacity in 6 months,which is well within the time frame most customers need. So if you see us building anything in Atlanta, you should assume that we have a customercontract in hand before we do that."

Or is the GDS deal sort of through you? How should we think about that?

At Chandler VI, I noticed a little bit of rearrangement of the -- from the prestabilized property, some with 12 megawatts was launched.6 megawatts went back into development. I was wondering if that's potentially related to the pushed-out deal or what you're seeing relate to thatfacility or more broadly, the Phoenix market. And secondly, I just wanted to ask, with the fixed to floating ratio at 60-40, how do you feel about thatlooking forward against the macroeconomic environment?"

I mean, we have stated generally, we're comfortable in the 50-50 range. With rising rates, we do -- weare more conscious of going to a more fixed rate. We can certainly do that synthetically through swaps. But the reality is floating rates, even withoutlook for increases in LIBOR this year, is still at a very low rate. The other thing is we're balancing that if we get to investment-grade, that is whenwe would want to fix more of our debt because there's at least a 100 basis point advantage for fixed rates when you're investment-grade. So wedo want to keep a reasonable amount of floating rate debt to be able to fix it when we achieve investment-grade."

We sold the most of our capacity inPhoenix followed by Dallas, Austin -- Dallas and Northern Virginia. I'm not sure specifically what you're talking about with stabilized or not, but ourfunnel is -- as I mentioned in my comments, is up 9% sequentially and 40% year-over-year.

I know you mentioned it in your prepared comments, but wanted to get a little bit more color. Given how much the stockhas sold off and how a lot of the reports have, I think, in a lot investors' minds been a little soft and guidance not as strong, are you seeing anythingdifferent out there? Do you see demand still being strong? And then to be a little bit cynical on it is that you're dropping your domestic CapEx from,call it, 800 to 500. Is that a sign? Or is just the shifting of opportunity into Europe?"

Look, I mean, you have to think about our industry in the context of what's going on more broadly in the IT landscape and, in particular,cloud, right. So you're coming off record sales for Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce. All of these companies came off fantastic quarters for e-commerce,for cloud businesses overall. And their growth is pretty tremendous, I mean, between 40% to 60% type growth rates on companies that are tenfoldbillions of dollar type top line companies. So these are really large companies growing at tremendous growth rates. And you see that they're notslowing down. Our business, by definition, will not slow down because all of that growth that you're seeing in the cloud all resides in the datacenter, and we are just providing the infrastructure that continues to support that growth. I think if there's anything that people should read infrom a quarter-to-quarter sales is just the lumpiness of how the industry works, right? I mean, these are really large transactions.

So these aren't like really shortsales cycles. These are long sales cycles, and they take a really long time. And while we feel that the quarterly result is little below our $20 millionestimate, we feel good when you look at this on the context of what we've been able to do over the last year. And over the year, we put up resultsat about 30% greater than our expectations. When you think about our refocus in terms of CapEx, think about it in 2 ways. One is last year, we werebasically sold out. We were bringing on capacity all year long just to build out and meet existing customer demand that was already presold. Webrought on additional capacity to make sure we had inventory in those key markets because we didn't want to run out of inventory. Last year,there were a couple of deals that we lost to other smaller startup players that we wouldn't have lost had we had inventory available. So we wantedto be thoughtful on bringing on additional capacity, which we basically did through year-end. The result of that is that you're going to see us spendsignificantly less capital in the U.S. because we have more inventory now that we didn't have last year. So we feel really strong from that. The otherthing you should think about is the way we're spending our capital is exactly in line with what we've been telling all of our partners for the last 1.5years or so is that we believe, fundamentally, this is an international business that to really be effective and helpful to customers, you need to havea global portfolio. And if you don't, you're in an inferior position strategically and you'll eventually be consolidated up. Our focus has always beenexpanding internationally. When we've been talking about that in the fourth quarter, what you saw is exactly what we said we were going to do.First we came out of the gate with the partnership with GDS and an investment that we made in them, which has more than doubled over the lastcouple of months. And then we followed that up shortly with further expansion in Zenium, which we're going to basically use as our land-and-expandstrategy in Europe. So we acquired that entity at a pretty high multiple. It's a dilutive acquisition, but strategically, we think it's really valuablebecause we're going to follow up with some additional capital to work there and build out a really big presence in Europe. And we expect the sameway methodically we've grown in U.S. over the last several years. We're going to do the same thing in Europe because we don't think that thecompetitive landscape is nearly as vicious in Europe as it is in the U.S. And from a product perspective, no one is doing big format data centers inEurope as they are doing in the U.S. We feel really confident about our ability to execute over there and export the same level of success wegenerated in states to Europe."

Morefield,CyrusOne Inc.,Executive VP & CFO,True,False,"I think, Richard, the other thing you have to think about for the domestic CapEx, we ended the year with almost $0.5 billion in CIP, and obviously,that's completely a domestic pipeline. And that -- hence the additional inventory that we went into this year with. And we're still estimating another$0.5 billion for domestic construction. So we're still spending about $1 billion in the U.S., but to Gary's point, the marginal capital is way moreweighted now towards international for the year."

I mean, that industry is still in its early stages.Maybe it's a $60 billion or $70 billion type of market right now out of $1 trillion annual enterprise spend. So really, really early stages. What you'reseeing is that the initial amount of that growth that was taking off was predominantly focused in the U.S., and that's what you saw over the lastcouple of years. And I expect that, that's going to continue to grow really nicely in this country for many, many years. The more incremental levelof growth, however, in the last 4 quarters has been in Europe.

And that's -- a great example of that is Zenium, the business that we'reacquiring. Like Franek, a serial entrepreneur, he's created a couple of companies, and he just created this one a few years ago and what did he dowas he started an operation and he quickly expanded into 4 data centers in 2 of the key cities in Europe. And this is like a private operator, smallercompany but tremendously successful, giving you a really good insight in terms of the competitive profile there that a small private company wasable to be so successful. That's why we believe that when we go there, we're going to basically be able to accelerate that growth, do things at scaleand at a lower cost in Europe, similar to what we've been doing in the U.S. and be able to take tremendous market share, right? We've been takingmore market share in the U.S -- the market domestically than anyone. Even, again, this quarter, in spite of like a bookings quarter that was a littlebelow our estimates, we still took 20% market share in the U.S. and, well, actually, globally if you compare one of our competitors at international.We still did really well versus a revenue share that's only about 15%. So we're punching well above our weight. We expect once we go to Europe,we're going to be able to accelerate that same success over there."

And if I think about sort of the pieces in terms of the longer-term growth for you folks, you had mentioned with the Zeniumdeal, 80% growth next year on an EBITDA basis and accretive on a normalized FFO basis, the potential to do additional deals in Europe, and Europein and of itself seems to be accelerating in terms of demand. Does this setup indicate -- I know it's early stage that '19 could be a better growthyear in terms of how you're thinking about things?"

If you think about all the things that we're just talking about on this call, right, and particularly in the bridge that Dianeshared in terms of the FFO bridge, like if you excluded all of these additional investments that we're doing, the GDS investments, dilution of Zenium,the additional capital that we put on the ground, I mean, our FFO per share would be up 15% year-over-year. We're intentionally taking off someof that to basically pay that forward in terms of setting up the company for a really nice growth rate well into '19 and beyond, because we'repositioning ourselves to take advantage of a competitive profile that we think we're going to be able to win in. And what that does is when wemade those investments in the U.S., it really frees the teams up to really focus on doing this in Europe. So now we have additional inventory. Wedon't need the same kind of construction design teams focused on building that out, what they were doing here. We'll repurpose them to focuson Europe and create the same level of success over there. So the way we run the business is all looking down the road in terms of where we'regoing to be in 5 years' time. Like none of these are short-term, short-duration assets. We're building a business that's going to be, we believe, thethird global data center player in the world, and we think we're positioned well to achieve that success."

Yes, I think the $20 million is a good bogey. And once we feel confident that the funnel is substantially higher than where it currentlysits now and we feel good that we can tick that up, we will, right? But we feel good about what we've been able to do this year. I mean, in aggregate,we guided to $80 million of bookings for the year and we delivered $105 million of bookings throughout the year. So we're 30% over what we toldfolks that we were going to do. We expect, as we head into '18, we're going to have quarters that we do above that, but we don't want to createexpectations that we're consistently going to be doing that. When I feel really good about the size of our funnel broadly, I'll definitely increase thatand share that with everyone. But for the time being, we're sitting in a pretty good position. I mean, our funnel is up 9% sequentially, 40% up versuslast year. Part of the 9% sequential increase is that some of the opportunities that we had expected to close in the first quarter pushed to the fourth.So we expect that those are going to -- that we expected to close in the fourth pushed to the first. So we expect that we should do well this quarter.With regard to Zenium, the response has been great. I mean, 75% of the customers that Zenium has are basically overlapping customers with us.And so the opportunity to do more with those customers over there was -- is great. I mean, they're really relieved that they have a solid partnernow with us, a capital partner that understands their business. So we expect that we're going to be able to help Franek grow his business a lotfaster than they originally were able to do, and we're more willing to bring on additional capacity there to supplement the growth of what theywould have normally done as a private company. We're a little more willing to do capital deployments for the opportunities that we see becausewe have a bigger sales funnel that we're tracking in the U.S., that we can bring to Europe than they probably have visibility to."

Look, I think the response in general has just been completely overblown for our -- the data centers as an asset class and us in particular, right?I think if you look at the fundamental growth drivers for our business, they are just as strong now as they were 2 months ago prior to an interestrate increase, which, as an aside, the 10 years only moved up 50 bps in 2 months. So it's not like a really significant move, particularly giving theabsolute returns that we generate in our business and the lower amount of leverage in general in the data center asset class versus the other REITsbroadly. So it's concerning that the equity has moved where it did, but I think for other people that are looking at it now, I think it's a pretty attractiveentry point. At a 4% cash yield with the growth story attached to it, it's a pretty interesting story. With regard to the way we think about theopportunity and how to use additional equity for -- to fund these transactions, I think you should look for us to continue to do the same thing wehave methodically. I mean, as Diane mentioned, our leverage coming out of the year was 4.7, so we're at a really low levered balance sheet.

So we have plenty of liquidity available to fund the growth over this period, and I think, to the extent that the equitylevels stay at these depressed levels, we're probably going to be willing to take up the leverage a little bit more. But longer term, as we've alwayssaid is that we need to stay on investment-grade glide path, and we don't want to do anything that jeopardizes our ability to do that. So you'll seeus as we've done over the past year, bring on additional equity when it's warranted. Over the course of '17, I think we raised about $700 million ofequity over the course of the year. And all the equity raises and everything else that we're planning to do are fundamentally embedded in theper-share guidance number that we had shared in that. So while we've never been specific about how much equity we're going to raise in anypoint in time, we always have also been very thoughtful, making sure that our balance sheet never gets over-levered because we want to makesure that we're continuing to grow in a strong manner."

So we have no near-term pressure, given our leverage. The other thing is we're verytransparent with the rating agencies that there will be times we push leverage, particularly after funding an acquisition and then manage it overtime. So we don't feel any near-term pressure, and we do think what's going on in the market seem to be, as Gary said, really overdone."

So it's unclear to us why we're not investmentgrade now, but we don't want to do anything that jeopardizes our ability to do that.

And I guess,the question is as we model and think about your company over the next multiple years, should we be thinking about a certain run rate of landacquisitions every year for you guys to further grow your business?"

Morefield,CyrusOne Inc.,Executive VP & CFO,True,False,"Well, for this year, and in the guidance, the marginal land acquisitions are in the $150 million range. And again, to remind you, we only did $20million of land acquisition in '17, which was the Atlanta parcel. So now we have plenty of land in the U.S. that are suitable for campuses, which ishow we like to develop. So if you look at our international guidance in the $300 million for CapEx range, roughly half is land and half is the buildoutof data center space, largely in the Zenium portfolio."

When you look at the time of our IPO, Jon, we had about $100 million of -- I mean, 100 acres of land in our inventory, and that was almost allexclusively in Cincinnati. It's currently at around 340 acres. And so that delta of 140 acres is all outside of Cincinnati. And so as we sit here right now,we have plenty of land available in basically every single U.S. market that we feel that we can meet plenty of existing inventory or existing customerdemand in all of our markets, with the exception of potentially Virginia and Phoenix, where we may need some additional capacity there in '19 orso. But right now, we could basically grow really nicely in the U.S. and never have to buy any additional land. So our focus from a land acquisitionperspective is going to be in Europe, where we're going to be looking to acquire additional properties to augment and accelerate the growth thatwe're picking up with Zenium and some of the other cities that we're looking at expanding to there."

And then, I'm curious, the bridge on the 2018 guidance, the Zenium acquisition, it looks like that's a $0.13 to $0.17 drag onyour estimates this year. I'm just kind of curious what the assumptions are around that. I know you raised a lot of equity in the fourth quarter. Isthat earmarked for the Zenium transaction as part of that dilution kind of the drag of raising capital before you actually close the deal?

With regard to the question on leasing, right, I mean, like $18 million of bookings in the quarter is prettystrong, I mean, relatively speaking, from a market perspective, right? That's about 20% of the market in the U.S. So we punched to well above ourweight in that quarter. Below the $20 million that we had mentioned, but when you look at these things over the course of the year, as I mentionedto Simon, we had $105 million in bookings on a guided number of $80 million. So we did well above that. We expect that, and this is the reasonwhy I've been hesitant to ever say we're going to be doing more than $20 million because we don't want people taking up their expectations andfactoring that in and setting expectations that we believe are unrealistic.

Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"President , CEO & Director",True,False,"Look, I think, Sami, when you look at -- look, we don't like losing. It's fundamentally what the read-in should be. When you look at the amount ofdeals that we closed this year, we closed the largest amount of deals proportionally than anyone in the industry in '17, and that was the same thingthat you saw in '16. Anytime we lose any deal to people, that's something that -- it just irritates us because we play to win. And when we lose, it'san opportunity lost for us. So our game has not changed. Our pricing, the way we approach customers, the way we do everything has not changedat all. And customers really like doing business with us, so that's why they continue to do more. The deals that I mentioned that we lost, these areactually pretty sizable deals and we lost it to good competitors that closed those deals. But the reason those competitors won was because wedidn't have inventory available in 2 key markets, which was Virginia and Chicago at the time, and we lost those deals to 2 other competitors thatfortunately won. So -- but nothing's changed in the competitive landscape. I think, if anything, I think what you see by the amount of people tryingto put capital to work here is that they all see how well everyone is doing, and they all see the broad demand and they see how big this industryis going to get to over time, which is why there's a lot of capital that's looking to come into the space either through private means or even in theJV arrangements that we've been discussing with folks. I think the underlying thesis for that is that everyone feels really good about the broadsecular demand drivers in this industry, which is why they're willing to commit the amount and duration of the capital that they will need to tie upin the space.     17     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

But in addition to that, the way most of these customers are doing their underwriting when they get their approvals is thatthey have to layer in the amount of additional capital that they have to put in to basically fill up these data centers. So if you think about it, right,the amount of capital that we put in is only about 1/3 of the capital that our customers would have to put in. So when they're going for approvalsin their organizations, their approval requests could be like $1 billion, $1.5 billion type commitment. And so those are big numbers. Even for guysthat have $40 billion of cash on their balance sheet, $1 billion, $1.5 billion commit is expensive. So I think what you're seeing there is just the resultsof that.

And then this is a little bit more of a bigger picture one. We've talked about the tenure a little bit and sort of the impact it may have had. ButI think the concern, the reason data centers have underperformed is maybe not a function of demand, which I think everybody believes the demandstory. It's as you've talked about, capital coming in and then the potential for supply. And Tom Ray's new company, Equinix is doing wholesale nowand so many others. And there seems to be little bit of fear for the potential for oversupply. It sounds like you're not buying that at all based on thedemand funnel, and I get that. But my question for you is if this narrative continues and it -- and rising rates continue to be a headwind, how doyou fund the business, the $1.5 billion or $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion of capital you're expecting to spend in 2018 without the equity market comingback?     19     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Look, I think -- and this is something -- and the reason why we have always managed the business to focus on costs is for exactly thisreason, right? So when we created this company, it's important to understand, we always wanted to be the low-cost provider in this industry exactlyfor this reason that we're talking about here today because if there's any -- look, this industry broadly is capital-intensive, high fixed cost. That typeof broad industry backdrop, regardless of the industry, is always susceptible to pricing. The reason why we have always maintained the low-costposition in the market and a supply chain that works as efficiently as it does is because I never wanted to put myself in a precarious position froma capital perspective, where I would be caught doing irrational things. We've always structured the business to make money because we can alwaysmake more money than everyone else because of what we've been able to do on our supply chain and our design. So we feel that we're in a really,really strong position. And as interest rates rise, some of the folks that are in inferior position on the left side of their balance sheet, meaning theircost to develop a megawatt of capacity is $10 million to $12 million to $13 million, they no longer have the right side of their balance sheet tocompete on. And as interest rates go up, their relative advantage that they would have done when they're just underwriting these things from apure equity return performance slowly goes away. And particularly, if you're levering up a lot, it goes even further away. So as interest rates rise,we believe that the low-cost provider in this industry is going to do really well, and we think that we're positioned to do really well. With regard tohow we think about the equity, we believe that longer term, our equity is going to continue to do well. Where it sits now, it's not really attractiveto us. And as Diane mentioned, I mean, we've got plenty of liquidity and availability that we can fund this additional capital growth for the Zeniumacquisition plus this additional stuff. She also mentioned that we'll probably take up leverage a little bit more. Unless we feel that the equity levelis appropriate, we are in no rush to additional or issue new amount of equity, just given where we sit now and know what our prospects are.
