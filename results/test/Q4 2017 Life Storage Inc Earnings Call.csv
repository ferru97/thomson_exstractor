During the quarter,we acquired a state-of-the-art CMO property in downtown Charlotte, sold a non-core store at Salt Lake and another in Austin, continued theramp-up of our third-party management platform and refinanced $450 million of short-term debt beyond a 10-year note with a sub-4% interestrate. We ended the quarter with 91% occupancy in our same-store pool and had over 90% for the total pool, both record year-end levels for LSI.This puts us in good position starting 2018 after a year in which we fully completed the integration of 120 stores we acquired in 2016 and fullycompleted the transition to the Life Storage brand.     In the self-storage sector, consumer demand remains strong, and we see healthy demand across our markets, giving us increased confidence inour prospects for growth in 2018. As we've said, demand for storage space typically outpaces population growth by a bit, and we continue to seethat with increased household formation. We also have been pretty successful in augmenting our residential customer base with more penetrationinto the business sector, stimulating demand via our B2B programs. New supplies have been the headwind to our sector the past 3 quarters andwill continue to be so probably into 2019. While it's created pressure on rate growth, we believe the impact remains manageable as evidenced byour ability to maintain strong occupancies.     Supply levels vary greatly across markets, and as noted on previous calls, we faced our biggest challenges in the big 4 Texas markets: HoustonDallas, Austin and San Antonio. In total, the properties in these markets comprise 23% of our same-store pool. To give some context to our exposure,we have 116 wholly owned properties in Texas. And in the past 24 months, 77 stores have opened in these areas. We foresee up to 39 more in thenext 18 months. So these are expected to have a somewhat adverse effect in as many as 93 of our Texas properties going into 2019. But as we'veconsistently said, these are rapidly growing vibrant markets that are ideal for self-storage. It's the cyclical drag that's causing us some pain now,but mid to long term, we love this big Texas City and expect to benefit from our strong presence there. Other markets, which have some oversupplyconcerns, include Chicago, Denver, parts of Phoenix and Miami. The impact to Life Storage resulting from new builds in these cities is not as strongas it is in Texas, but there will be pricing pressure due primarily to the short-term disruption caused by move-in incentives. We're bullish at mostof Florida, St. Louis and much of the Northeast. While we're seeing some new supply in these markets, it's not always near us, and for the most part,the construction has been warranted. The markets we've moved into last year, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Northern California, are likewise performingwell. With the exception of property taxes and Internet spend, operating expenses remain pretty well controlled, and we expect that to continuefor the coming quarters. But from all we can predict, property tax increases are going to remain a significant factor resulting in NOI growth.     Looking at the transaction market, we've seen little movement in bid/ask prices over the past few quarters. Few data points exist, although a fewmidsize reduced quality portfolios are on the market. There's continued strong interest from the private sector for storage properties of alldenominations. We're aware of the challenges to our sector with some markets needing time to absorb the recently built facilities and others justabout to see the start of some new constructions. But demand is there and the tools are in our kit for Life Storage to perform well even in thiscompetitive part of the cycle. These include proven marketing revenue management and customer service platforms, a well-developed B2B division,opportunities across our portfolio expand and enhance our properties, a rock-solid balance sheet and strong operating cash flow. We entered 2018confident that our largest scale, improved financial strength, stronger brand and greater presence will enable us to grow the value of our company.     And Andy, with that, I'll turn it to you."
3,64388363,LIFE STORAGE INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, LSI",Q4 2017 Life Storage Inc Earnings Call,Andrew J. Gregoire,"Life Storage, Inc.","CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary",False,True,"Thanks, Dave.     As Dave mentioned, last night, we reported quarterly adjusted funds from operations of $1.34 per share compared to adjusted FFO of $1.31 pershare for the same period in 2016. These results were above the high end of our forecast, driven by better-than-expected same-store performance,as well as CofO and lease-up store growth that exceeded our estimates. We have excluded from adjusted FFO the cost of interest rate swapterminations and other charges associated with our debt refinancing that occurred in conjunction with our issuance of 10-year bond. Also excludedfrom FFO was the cost related to Paul Powell's retirement, a valued member of our team, who retired after 20 years with Life Storage.     Same-store quarterly revenue grew 1.3% as a result of occupancy gains. Same-store occupancy at December 31 was a fourth quarter record highfor our company of 91%, a 60 basis point increase over 2016 year-end occupancy. Fourth quarter same-store expenses outside of property taxes     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

As noted on our previous call, we gained significant online traction with the Life Storagebrand early in the fourth quarter, which enabled us to reduce our Internet marketing spend to more normalized levels. As expected, property taxesincreased 8% in the fourth quarter with significant increases in Austin, Texas, Chicago, St. Louis and certain Florida markets.     In addition to the improved performance of our same-store portfolio, we continue to see consistent growth trends at the properties that wepurchased at Certificate of Occupancy are very early in the lease-up stage. Even though we are in the traditionally slower season, average occupancyfor these lease-up stores increased by 260 basis points on a sequential quarter basis from 74.8% at September 30 to 77.4% at December 31.     For Life Storage acquisitions, stores continue to grow occupancy with average quarterly occupancy at the 70 stable stores growing to 90.6% fromthe prior year's 86.3%. The 11 non-stabilized Life Storage stores experienced occupancy gains ahead of expectations and had an average occupancyof 86.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017, leaving additional room for growth in both pools. The overall fourth quarter revenue increase also reflecteda 49% increase in management fee income to $2.4 million as the strength of the Life Storage brand is resonating with independent owners.     Fourth quarter G&A costs were flat year-over-year even with the added $941,000 of officer retirement cost reported. We further strengthened ourbalance sheet during the quarter by opportunistically refinancing $225 million of short-term bank debt and a portion of our line of credit. The new10-year $450 million public bond carry some very attractive 3.875% rate. This transaction also significantly extended our debt maturity schedule.Our weighted average debt maturity is now 7.8 years. At the end of the quarter, we had $9 million of cash on hand and $395 million available onour line of credit. We have no debt maturities until December of 2019. Our debt service charge ratio was a healthy 4.9x and our net debt to recurringEBITDA ratio was 5.6x. We acquired one newly constructed store during quarter in Charlotte, North Carolina for $12.5 million. We have no remainingCertificate of Occupancy stores under contract.     With regard to guidance, although we have achieved positive revenue trends in many of our top markets, we continue to see softness in othermarkets due to new supply. From the expense side, we see pressure on payroll and benefit costs, property taxes and insurance. Nonetheless, weexpect a decrease in Internet marketing spend to keep overall expense growth in check. We have forecasted revenue growth for Q1 to be in the1.25% to 2.25% range. And for the year, revenue growth is expected at 1% to 2%.     Expenses outside of property taxes are expected to increase between 1% and 2% for the quarter and the year, while property taxes are forecastedto increase 5.5% to 6.5%. Once again, we are not including in our same-store group any stores acquired as CofO that have not reached stabilizedoccupancy above 80% at market rates as of January 2017. Our guidance assumes no acquisitions for our own portfolio nor does it reflect anypotential dispositions. As a result of the above assumptions, we are forecasting adjusted funds from operation for the full year 2018 to be between$5.33 and $5.43 per share and between $1.24 and $1.28 per share for the first quarter of 2018.     And with that, operator, we can open the call up for questions."

And that includes Life and some other acquisitions done earlier in the year,including our California exposure and the -- Los Angeles. We expect that to add about 50 basis points to NOI. And we'll show that as we alwayshave. We'll show the different pools, so you'll see that what we expect's about 50 basis points of NOI."

And then just with regards to some of the headwinds that you had that now should be drivers of growth. Can you give us any color on kindof volume trends with the Google search? Kind of what you're thinking on the marketing spend? And your latest thoughts on the [ramp ups] toexisting -- kind of things you'd highlighted before that -- you talked of -- present opportunities for growth in '18?

Gregoire,"Life Storage, Inc.","CFO, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary",True,False,"Yes. The marketing spend, we would expect 4Q is probably a good run rate to use for 2018. Obviously, Google price is going up in the fourth quarter.October was high for us and then it tailed off. So it's probably a good run rate to use for 2018. Q1, you won't see the big benefit because we didn'thave the heavy spend. 2 and 3, you'll see the biggest benefit, probably a -- it could be anywhere between a 10% and 20% reduction in those quartersinterim to that spend. Regarding in-place, as you already know, we're working on a few different scenarios. We would expect some differentstrategies to be tested throughout 2018. Most of it -- most of those in-place increases will occur in April, May and June."

I guess, I would've thought that with the tougher first F comps, you'd startlower and accelerate in the back half, but your 1Q guidance is going for slightly higher growth than your full year expectation. So any color herewould be great."

I mean, occupancy is still relatively high. It is burning off, as we thought it would.Our rates are pretty strong in Houston. That's the good trends that we've seen so far, that the rates are -- come back to positive territory, whichthey were negative for quite a good portion of 2017. So rates -- Street rates are positive. Occupancy is slowly burning off from the victims of thathurricane. So that's really what's driving the front end of that.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

We're sitting here, waiting for the busy season to start, which has been a real tail. For 4 or 5 years, we really rolled through itand came out of busy season really happy. And then in May of 2016 and again in '17, it was a little slower than we expected. And then that was a-- that gave us some difficulties with regard to projections and guidance. So we're sitting here as we always do in the month of February givingguidance without knowing how are price increases are going to work with the customer demand that's going to be. We feel pretty good sittinghere. But again, we're not going to lay it out there and expect a real pop. So it is -- we're looking forward to May.

And for my second question, Dave, the stock has come off in the past month, you're still a little above where you bought back stock in 3Q,but not too far off. So should we expect to see the active buying back shares again here? Are you assuming any buybacks in guidance? And probablyyou're going to look to balance this opportunity with adding further to the joint ventures?"

We always look, Jeremy. It's a -- we have pretty strong cash flow. We've got places to put itat times, but we're -- we didn't -- we haven't joined into any joint venture agreements as of February 21, but we may. So it's a balancing effort. Andcertainly, we're not happy with the share price. And it becomes more and more compelling when there's a 7 in front of it. So we will -- as we havein the past, as we did in the third quarter, we'll look at all the options and see what we have. And the one thing we've been pretty strong about is,we're not going to leverage up certainly to buy shares back. But we do have a lot of free cash flow, and we'll allocate accordingly when we see thebest opportunities."

We've got somemore grab with the Internet presence, so that's making us feel pretty good. The -- with our few rate increases that we have put in have stuck. So Ithink we're feeling pretty good about the year. But again, there's not a lot of data points to latch onto and give you anything definitive in this3-month period, especially."

We can't controlnew supply pressure that comes on. The competitive pricing has been pretty strong. So it's tough to be more aggressive on those numbers.

That's -- you guys are pretty muchlooking at the midpoint anyway, so cushioning to top and bottom is one way to do it. And -- but we feel -- we hold our people in the field at theAM level, the RBP level, here in the home office, pretty tight to budget. I guess 25 bps on either end might give us something to hang on to. But atthe end of the day, we're -- we build off the midpoint. And that's our operating budget inside.

Again, Chicago impact is maybe a little bit more, but the others don't have anywhere near the impact of the Texasmarkets. So yes, this -- it's in a lot of place. And I think it'll roll. I think we'll see supply rolling over the next couple of years. But I actually think asmuch as we had Houston and Texas high on the list of problems, I think we've seen most of deliveries in Houston and Austin anyway. Dallas, we'regoing to have some pretty significant deliveries, the balance, at least, affecting us the balance of '18 and into '19. But it rolls. If any -- and then you'vegiven to the absorption phase as opposed to deliveries. But we're looking at Houston and Austin now as perhaps by the end of this year, we won'tbe talking about them so much. But then there'll be others. So -- and other companies have other markets that are impacted much stronger thanwe are. So it's going to roll.

And we've had some pretty good success. We share with our partners, our clients a greater part of theinsurance revenue. We work with them pretty closely on the spending, sharing and so forth. So we have had sort of a modified model like that.And it's worked pretty well. I don't know the extend in this, but I think they sort of caught most of us by surprise yesterday. They have been suchvoracious opponents of the strategy that this is a pretty big turnaround for them. So I think -- we turned down a lot of business that's in marketswhere we don't think we can do a good job if we don't have scale. We don't want our third-party management client to be our first or second storein a market that they're not -- we're not going to benefit much. I think that's where Public is going to go. So we -- yes, we're evaluating it certainlybecause we didn't have any idea they were coming in here. We have to see what their marketing is going to be all about. But we had a pretty goodtraction in the last few months even. We signed 18 stores over the last 6 weeks. We've got 32 more that we expect to be signed in the next fewweeks. I don't know. I think as a revenue generator, it's not a big thing for us. It's more a presence and a cost-sharing scale thing with us. So it'sreally early to evaluate. I'm going onboard that I'd probably -- I'm qualified to speak on this yet because we have to see what they're going to do.We have to see what their market is going to be about and how they're going to attack it."

As Andy mentioned, we were down through that -- the lowest part of the down, 9% year-over-year. And we're even. AndI think we're going to see some of the price there ourselves. Yes, we have a little bit quicker drain on occupancy, although, we're still higher thanwe were. But it has allowed us to use the opportunity to put in rate increases, and we've done that.

In terms of kind of yoursame-store revenue, the cadence throughout the course of the year, obviously high 1% range in 1Q, but where do you think we end up by thefourth quarter?

And now those 18 stores in Chicago, the new supply that is affecting those stores, freerent has been the way we've been combating that. It's been increasing occupancy.

We boughtthe stores July 15th of 2016. So the third quarter had 15 extra days and then, I guess, I think we indicated that somewhere. But yes, so they -- itwasn't 20%.

And when you do your [A book] consistently you're testing out different pricing strategies and advertising. And when you'redoing your AB testing in China, push rents where you can.
