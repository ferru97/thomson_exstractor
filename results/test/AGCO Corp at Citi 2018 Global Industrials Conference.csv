And then just if you have questions as we go along, just raise your hand and I'll get to you. So yes, maybe, Andy, just start from anoverall industry perspective. Maybe just as you think about your 3 major geographic regions of North, South America as well as Europe, from anindustry perspective, and there's probably too much focus on this in kind of looking at point estimates. But as you look at your outlook for '18relative to one of your peers that reported on Friday, there's a little bit more of a gap kind of emerging here. I'm just curious in terms of if you weighin, in terms of whether that's you being more conservative, they being more optimistic. Just -- and kind of comment about just what you're seeingacross the markets with respect to that."
3,64389214,AGCO CORPORATION,02/22/2018," 1:45PM, AGCO",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,Senior VP & CFO,True,False,"Okay, no problem. Yes, I don't think -- do I need to push this button? I don't think we're probably too -- as far apart as everyone thinks. One of thedifferences is that we do have different year-ends, and the fourth quarter was -- and it showed some improvement in both Europe and NorthAmerica, which has factored in their numbers probably a little more than ours. But in general, I think we're seeing some of the same impacts. If youstart in North America, our forecast is that it's going to be relatively flat. But we do see some of the same dynamics they're seeing. So in the largerequipment, we do expect to see some improvement. What we are seeing is a little more impetus towards customers wanting to replace equipment,which we haven't seen over the last few years. I think we started talking about that a little bit mid-year 2017, and certainly, we think that's goingto carry over, over the next few years. As farmers have had their equipment for 4 to 5 years, they have that need to start to replace it, either fromtrying to get back into a warranty period with new equipment, or just to avoid risks around maintenance cost, downtime, those kinds of things.So I do think we're seeing the same type of trends there that should help the market, to some extent. Now that replacement demand, I think, isgoing to help. But certainly, to drive a real significant quick upturn in demand, we need to see stronger farm income, which is driven by commodityprices. So we're still waiting for that to see a more robust recovery in North America. But at least, the trend's moving in the right direction at thispoint. What we also are expecting is maybe some -- a little softening on the small equipment side. The industry has been extremely robust overthe last couple years as the economy -- the general economy has improved, those small tractors have different demand drivers than what we seein row crops so it's more general economic conditions, a little more around dairy, livestock. And so those markets have been pretty strong and we     2     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

So the demand will still be above average andstill be very strong, but that might be some of the differences in what we see versus some of our competitors. As we move to Europe, which is oneof our -- which is our most important market, what we've seen is an improvement in demand over the course of 2018 -- 2017. A lot of that demandincrease was driven by improvements in the profitability of the dairy sector as pricing in that market has improved. And so I think we're still feelingsome of the tailwinds from that recovery into the first part of 2018. But we do expect that to somewhat level off. There's a lot of expectations thatdairy prices might pull back a little during the course of this year, so I'm not sure that there's going to be additional legs to that area. But I do thinkthat demand continues to be relatively good in that sector. When you look at the row crop or cereal farmers in Europe, same kind of situation aswhat we see in North America. The fleet is starting to age a little, so there's starting to be more need to replace equipment. Their typical amortizationperiod for equipment is probably 5 years, so they're starting to get past that in terms of where they are. And if they want to keep that tax deduction,maybe there's some demand drivers there. Opposing that is where we are just in terms of their profitability and where commodity prices are, they'reon -- at the lower end of the levels. And so from that standpoint, we think that, that will somewhat mitigate that demand driver. So we expect tosee a good market in Europe and a steady market in 2018. South America, again, a lot of different drivers there. I think from a -- just a pure profitabilitystandpoint, farmers are in pretty good shape. They should have margins and better soy bean crops this year, based on where pricing and exchangerate levels are today. The FINAME program, which is important in terms of financing, is at relatively high interest rates right now, because the normalBrazilian interest rates have now come down to such an extent that, that FINAME rate is not really that attractive. So that's not really a demanddriver at this point. And we might expect to see some help with that as they renew the FINAME program midyear this year, so we're hoping to seesome improvements in the rates. So there might be some element of farmers looking at that and waiting to see what happens with the FINAMErates. Other than that, there's obviously a political situation. We have an election year, so that drives a little uncertainty in the marketplace as welland maybe mitigates some desires for farmers to invest heavily. So overall, kind of a balanced view. And so we think the market will be kind of flatto slightly up in Brazil this year."

That's helpful. Maybe a question you may get once or twice today, just relating to underlying inflation and steel costs. And so maybe justfocus a little bit there in terms of what AGCO has done over the years to mitigate some of your risk through some of the sourcing and globalpurchasing initiatives, and then how that potentially mitigates the impact, and then, ultimately, the industry's ability to get pricing?"
5,64389214,AGCO CORPORATION,02/22/2018," 1:45PM, AGCO",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,Senior VP & CFO,True,False,"Sure. Yes. Obviously, it's one of the areas of cost risk that we have is steel prices. It's an important part of our cost structure of our equipment, andso it's something that we're monitoring very closely. In general, we've been very successful in our purchasing activities. We've moved from kind ofa fragmented regional structure to a more global purchasing organization over the last 5 or 6 years. That's been very successful for us in terms ofbetter leveraging the buy that we have and also moving to a more global supply base, so moving into lower-cost environments so that we cangenerate savings that way. So year-over-year, we're seeing improvement in our material cost structure relative to the pricing that we're getting,so we're generating a net price improvement every year. And we think that we can continue to do that. As it relates, in general, to the steel situation,our -- as you point out, our industry has been pretty good about passing on those inflationary level type costs. And so if we get something that'sunusual this year in terms of costs associated with the steel, I would expect that we'll try to pass that on because we do want to -- in order to meetour targets, we want to have that 60, 70 basis point net pricing that we talked about in our prior conference calls. We -- the advantage that we haveis that we're not a direct buyer of a lot of steel. We're buying components from suppliers that have steel, so there's typically a 3- to 6-month lagperiod between when the steel price moves and when it starts to hit us. And so that gives us a little time to get pricing in and have the visibility inplace to try to have that not affect our margins too much."

We have our manufacturing located, in mostcases, where we sell the equipment. So we're pretty well balanced from a geographic perspective. But in the U.S., I think we're more -- tend to bemore of an importer of finished goods, maybe as much as 15% or so of our total sales in the U.S. come from -- maybe half of that is from Europeand then the other half from Asia and India. So maybe a little more [projected], too, because some of the manufacturing is done outside of the U.S.So that's something else to keep in mind."

But I think, Andy, you've said in the past, it'slike 1/4 of the raw material buy is steel. Is that still an accurate number?"

Or maybe another way to look at it is probably a little north of 15% of our cost -- total costs would be steel related."

Maybe switching gears to just market share across the regions. In '18, as I believe it is in every year, the assumption is that you gainsome market share overall. Are there specific regions or products that maybe you're more optimistic on for '18 in terms of gaining some marketshare?"
14,64389214,AGCO CORPORATION,02/22/2018," 1:45PM, AGCO",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,Senior VP & CFO,True,False,"Well, we always plan for market share growth, and I think we have been pretty successful. Usually, as you point out, that market share is driven bynew product introductions, so something new to the market that we're providing. In '17, we did a pretty good job in terms of market shareimprovement in North America, mainly around the small tractors that we've introduced during '16 and '17. We've really gotten a boost from thenew equipment that were -- we designed, it's a product that comes out of China. It's called our Global Series and it's selling quite well all aroundthe world. And that's helping us not only in the U.S. but in Europe. And we're now introducing some of those new products into South Americastarting last year, and then we'll have another round of them in 2019 in Brazil. So that's certainly an area where we have some good momentum.We also have some new products on the very highest end of the market. We talked a number of times about a new product out of our Fendtmanufacturing group, it's called the X1000, it's a larger traditional frame tractor than our competition sells. It gives the product a little more flexibilityof use. And that has sold very well in Europe as well as in North America under the Challenger brand. And so we're seeing some growth there. And     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

So that productline should continue to help us. It's not big units, but it's a big dollar product. And then we have some new products coming out in 2018 around abrand new tractor in North America that we also sell in Europe. We won an award in Europe on that product, so that's -- should sell very well. Wealso have a new sprayer coming out in North America and we expect to see some growth in that market for AGCO. So it's generally around thepace of new product introduction. And as you can tell by looking at our investments and engineering expense, we have increased that over time.So over the last decade, we might have doubled -- almost tripled our investment in engineering expense. And so that gives us the chance tointroduce product at a more rapid pace, and that gives us an opportunity to grow those market shares a little more freely. So I think it all kind ofties back to our investment strategy. And then, obviously, improvements in distribution as well that's helping us do -- win in the marketplace."
15,64389214,AGCO CORPORATION,02/22/2018," 1:45PM, AGCO",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst,True,False,"Got it. Just touching on new products. Maybe the combine segment is not one that AGCO has been a big player globally, from a market shareperspective, but obviously, the new IDEAL launch coming this year. What are your expectations? I think you had talked about like a $300 millionnumber in terms of revenue potential. What -- over what time frame and what markets are likely to drive -- where is this going to be more targeted?"
16,64389214,AGCO CORPORATION,02/22/2018," 1:45PM, AGCO",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,Senior VP & CFO,True,False,"Okay. So taking a step back, AGCO's growth strategy, we still are, I guess, more heavily weighted than we'd like to ultimately be in terms of havingour sales be around the tractor business. So we would like to grow globally and leverage our distribution capabilities and our strong dealer networkselling non-tractor products, and that includes combines, hand-forged equipment, sprayers, those types of products. And so a lot of that additionalmoney that we've put in product development has obviously been in refreshing our tractor offering but also in these new other products, thesecomplementary products outside of tractors. And one of the big ones was -- is combines, and we've talked a lot in our December meeting aboutthe new IDEAL combine. We introduced that late in 2017 at the big farm show in Germany called Agritechnica. It was the Machine of the Year, andso it's gotten a lot of good publicity and a lot of good feedback from customers and analysts about the product. It's kind of a clean sheet of paperdesign that will enable us to have better features and have better performance of any combines that we sell today, and we think it'll be verycompetitive versus what our competition has in the market. It also provides us with an opportunity to have a more global platform for the product.Right now, we have 7 or 8 different combine platforms or designs that we're producing and selling around the world, and this will reduce andeliminate probably 5 or 6 of those into 1. So it's going to be a product that we can produce in Europe, U.S. and in Brazil and enable us to have theability to have one design, leverage purchasing better, obviously, leverage design costs and those kinds of things. So the plan for that product isthat we're continuing to do the testing and fine-tuning the design of the product this year. We will produce 70 or 80 combines this year and havean extensive demonstration program and marketing program in our markets, particularly in Europe and North America, this year. But we won't beselling any of the equipment this year, it's more about marketing and fine-tuning of the product. In 2019, we'll start to sell the product. And so aswe talked about, our goal was to get maybe $300 million or so of sales. That would probably be over -- once we start selling it, maybe over a 3-yearperiod, something like that. So we're 3, 4 years away from reaching those goals. So this is something that is -- we're very excited about. We thinkwe have a product that will be successful in the market, and we're trying to make sure that we do this the right way in terms of getting the productright, marketing it in the right way so that we are successful over the long term."

Maybe talk a bit about M&A. You've been fairly active both on the equipment side, as well as GSI. So maybe just update us there interms of, I guess, I'll start with GSI in terms of whether -- are there -- I mean, you've done a lot of kind of build out the portfolio there. Is there moreto go in terms of products that you feel you need to be in on either on the protein or the storage side?"

I would say that, at this point, we think we're in prettygood shape, so the focus this year would probably be a little more on integration rather than new acquisitions. But we're always very opportunistic     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

And so if something comes up that we think we can add value through being able to leverage it through our distributionnetworks, gives us an advantage in a geography we're not strong in, we'll certainly consider it. But we have, I think, filled out our product lines atGSI quite well, so on the protein production side, we're now -- really have a good product line as it relates to poultry, swine and now, with someof these recent acquisitions, in the egg business as well. So we support producers in all those markets now, and that gives us a good flexibilitybecause those markets do vary from year-to-year in terms of being up or down, so it gives us a little more stability in terms of our profitability. Onthe grain side, we've expanded not only in looking at grain storage, but also the -- all the material handling and conditioning equipment. One ofour acquisitions, it was a few years ago, was in the commercial side of the business. So we can handle big commercial conveyance products now,which gives us some opportunities to grow not only in the U.S. but outside the U.S., like in Brazil, Eastern Europe and those kinds of things. So Ithink we have a good -- we probably have the broadest product line in the industry. We're a more global company than most of our competitors.And a lot of our customers are global customers. And so we think being able to support them in all the markets will be a big selling advantage forus as we bid on project -- new projects for those companies."

And going back to -- you started with North America and that maybe you're a little bit more optimistic on the higher horsepowermarkets. Would you expect to see a similar kind of directional relationship with your storage sales in North America, just given the -- if you actuallydo start to see some spending on the row crop on the equipment side, would that extend it?"

Big projects atport or transport locations or in processing centers for the big producers. And so those, I think, have been held up a little by industry consolidationand some profitability issues by some of the big producers. And so I'd think as those markets recover and some of the consolidation like in the seedindustry and things like that recover or get -- we get through that, then we'll see that demand start to pick up as well."

And speaking of -- shifting gears to tax reform here in the U.S. Obviously, just given the profitability, where it is in North America, not realizingthe benefit. But have you looked -- or are you further along in terms of potential capital or structural -- capital structure changes in terms of maybeissuing more debt in Europe? Maybe just speak there in terms of what you potentially can do to take more advantage of the lower tax rates here?"
22,64389214,AGCO CORPORATION,02/22/2018," 1:45PM, AGCO",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,Senior VP & CFO,True,False,"Yes. So give everyone a little background, and what we're talking about here is our ability to improve our U.S. profitability. Right now, we're in aloss position in the U.S. because of the weak market, and so we're not benefiting losses in the U.S., so that's driving our tax rate up. And so one ofthe advantages of the new tax reform is our ability to move unremitted profits that we've generated in Europe or outside the U.S. back into theU.S. and so -- on a more ratable basis. And so by doing that, we think we -- one of our strategies will be to delever our U.S. balance sheet, reducethe amount of interest expense we have in the U.S. and then move it into Europe or other markets where we can get a tax deduction for it. And sothat should help our tax rate overall. And so we're in the planning process right now, and we have to look at where we can put that debt intoEurope. And then, obviously, there's structuring issues with what debt we can retire and the timing of it and things like that. So this will be a processthat we'll be working on over the course of this year and probably even into the next few years, depending on when the debt -- when we can retirethe debt and things like that. So it's not a quick fix, but something that's going to be a longer-term opportunity for us and it should help our taxrate modestly over the next few years as a result."

I guess, you're kind of looking to get away -- or to get to lower exposure to tractor. So I guess,where do you see holes in the current portfolio? Where would you think to grow or to introduce new products, one? And then two, how does theprofitability of these new product introductions compare to more traditional tractor offerings?"
25,64389214,AGCO CORPORATION,02/22/2018," 1:45PM, AGCO",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,Senior VP & CFO,True,False,"I think we're feeling better and better about our product lineup. I think it's the best AGCO's ever had. Through one of our acquisitions we did in2017, we filled a hole that we had in our hay and forage -- European hay and forage offering. It's a baler and a loader wagon that we didn't have,which was not allowing us to feel like we could aggressively ask our dealers to sell our hay and forage line compared to the competitive lines theywere carrying. And so now we have a big full-line strategy that we're unveiling in Europe to where we want to have, in our Massey, in our Fendtbrands, a full line, which is tractors, hay and forage and combines that we offer and have our dealers aggressively selling on our behalf. And so ourdealers are very excited about that opportunity because of the new line up that we have. And so I think through acquisitions and product developmentover the last few years, we feel like we have the best lineup that we've ever had. Obviously, we always want to get better and we'll continue todevelop new features, new capabilities, but there's not something, I think, we'd point out and say, ""Well, we have a big hole that we still need tofill."" In terms of profitability, those products, combines, hay and forage equipment typically are at or above the margin capabilities that we haveon our tractor side if we can get that to the appropriate levels of volume that we need. One of the disadvantages we've had like in the combinebusiness is we've been at a relatively low market share. And that just -- we just don't have the scale in order to get the margins where our competitionhas them right now. So the more we can grow with a better featured product and gain some volume there, that's going to accelerate the marginsin those products. So the other aspect of it is those are typically at least as good or better from a parts standpoint. So there's more maintenance,more parts that you have to continue to replace on those types of pieces of equipment. So that's a benefit to our parts operation and a benefit tothe service revenue for our dealers. So it's a profit opportunity for our dealers, makes our dealers stronger, as well."

It's obviously been a good growth driver for you in Europe. I think there's been some recent, I guess,streamlining in North America amongst the dealers. So can you see -- maybe speak to the opportunity in terms of driving higher parts capture,irrespective of when the combine is launched, just from an overall dealer standpoint in North America as result of it?"
27,64389214,AGCO CORPORATION,02/22/2018," 1:45PM, AGCO",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Greg Peterson,AGCO Corporation,Director of IR,True,False,"Sure. Absolutely, Tim. So we've spoken a good bit about increasing our investments in engineering and product development. And with that,typically, that means, in a lot of cases, higher-end products, more sophistication, which lends themselves to a dealer involvement with maintenance,which is a very good thing when you look at parts and share of parts business. And so what we've then done is layer on our capabilities for dealers.We've implemented SAP -- a global SAP parts system for our dealers, and what that has done is dramatically increase the response time -- or reducethe response time, I should say, for having parts available for our end customers. And that usually is the #1 concern of a farmer is downtime. So tothe extent we can minimize that and layering also with some of the precision farming capabilities that we have in terms of proactive monitoring,that also is helping as we move towards reducing that downtime. So enabling our dealers to provide higher levels of service is helping us growour parts business. So I think you mentioned that we kind of started this initiative in Europe and, over the last couple of years, have been aggressivelyexpanding our capabilities in the U.S. So we've added different marketing programs on top of that with some preventive maintenance programsofferings. We've done some extended warranties on used equipment. So in essence, what we're doing is improving the capabilities of our dealersso that it's -- so our end customers go to them for their parts, and so it's a good experience, and so that is showing dividends.     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

You mentioned used inventories in North America. The plan for this year is more work to do. Do you think based on what we can seetoday, do you think -- and based on the retail environment that exists, do you think that issue is largely complete by the end of the year or is there-- would there be maybe more wood to chop there?"
29,64389214,AGCO CORPORATION,02/22/2018," 1:45PM, AGCO",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,Senior VP & CFO,True,False,"Well, I think we'll be in a lot better shape by the end of the year. It's something that we will, I think, continue to look at in terms of -- from anopportunistic standpoint. Having lower dealer inventories is a good thing from the standpoint, the equipment's fresher in the field, you don't haveas much aging or age discount issues, and it just makes you overall more efficient. And so from the standpoint of having our dealers feel comfortablewith their inventory levels, I think we'll be -- hopefully, in pretty good shape by the end of the year based on where the market may be recoveringa little as well as the actions we're taking to continue to reduce the absolute amount of inventory in the field. As we look into the future, I thinkthere'll probably be some areas where we think we can continue to turn the inventory faster in our field -- in our field inventory. And so I think,again, that's more from a productivity, cost reduction standpoint that we'll look at doing that rather than something that our dealers are demanding."

Maybe the dealers in Brazil. I mean, you've talked about, for a number of years, the need to kind of strengthen and professionalize the dealerbase in Brazil. Just given the historic strong position for Massey in the southern parts of the country and more their production moves into thecenter and northern parts of Brazil, what needs to be done there from here? And I guess, just what's a -- is it a -- do you think you have the productthere to compete when you do have the actual dealers in place?"
31,64389214,AGCO CORPORATION,02/22/2018," 1:45PM, AGCO",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Greg Peterson,AGCO Corporation,Director of IR,True,False,"Sure. So it's some good questions there. So yes, the market in Brazil is very different. There's the -- and when you get to the different geographicareas. And Central and Southern Brazil is where you have the more established dealer networks. And we're very happy with our distribution inthose areas. It's -- as you move further north into the Mato Grosso region where more of the bigger farms, the newer farms are, is where we'reworking really hard to develop our distribution network there. The good news is that the competition is having to do the same thing. Becausethat's where, over the last 5 to 10 years, you've seen the new land being put into production. So we have historically had a big advantage in Centraland Southern Brazil just because our brands and our distribution network had been in Brazil for decades, so the competition was kind of playingcatch-up in Central and Southern Brazil. In Northern Brazil, it's kind of the new frontier, and that's where all the new development's taking place.So what we've had to do is sign up new dealers for those territories, and in a lot of cases, it -- we'll have a very strong dealer in another part of Brazilthat has indicated interest to expand into that region, and so we've gone in that direction in some instances. In other instances, it might be a cardealer or another successful business person that said, ""Oh, I'd like to sell farm equipment in that region."" So we've had success both with existingdealers and with brand-new folks. And so we're working very hard to cover that area. It's important that they develop brick-and-mortar locationsso that they can sell and service the equipment. And just like in Europe and in North America, we're helping the dealers move up the technologycurve so that they're capable of selling and servicing the equipment. The other thing that's going on for us in Brazil in that part of the country isthat we're starting to look at jointly selling our 2 brands. So in Brazil, we have very strong positions, as you mentioned, with Massey Ferguson, butalso with our Valtra dealers, which have historically been a little stronger on the sugarcane side. So we have an opportunity in the Mato Grossoregion where we're kind of starting almost with a clean sheet of paper to do some joint marketing. So in some cases going forward, we'll see somedealers that are going to sell both brands. So we're working, both with the exclusive dealer model, but then also testing that joint sales model. Soa lot of work is being done there. We're confident -- you mentioned, the other thing is having the right products in place to compete. And one ofthe things that we've focused on in 2017 and will -- and continue to impact us into 2018 is the localization of the bigger tractor technology thatwe're selling in the U.S. and in Europe. And so you saw, especially in the back half of the year, some of the costs in our South America region, someof the costs associated with that in our margins were impacted as result of localizing a lot of that technology. And we'll continue to see that intothe first part of 2018. And then as we roll out those new models, we would expect -- and as we ramp up suppliers in Brazil, that's another key thing,is to be successful and to really sell products in Brazil, you have to make them in Brazil to qualify for the FINAME financing that we talked about.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

And so with that, there's some additional costs. We don't have yet the volume discounting thatwe will when we get to scale. And the other thing is, in our factories, we're having to train employees on the new models that we're building. Soas we kind of get through this transitionary period, as we get into 2018, number one, we'll see, we think, better performance in the market. Butalso as we move through the transitionary period, you should see our margins improve in Brazil in the back half of the year. So the first half of theyear will continue to be less than desirable margins. And then as we get into the back half, we would expect to see margin improvement. So a lotfor us going on in Brazil this year."

33,64389214,AGCO CORPORATION,02/22/2018," 1:45PM, AGCO",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Greg Peterson,AGCO Corporation,Director of IR,True,False,"Yes, yes."
34,64389214,AGCO CORPORATION,02/22/2018," 1:45PM, AGCO",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",Director and U.S. Machinery Analyst,True,False,"Maybe just my last one is just on Europe overall. And again, and kind of somewhat in absence of real-time indicators, people tend to zero in on thesentiment measures in Europe. And I think they're -- last month, it was at a 7 or 8-year high. And the discussion there and the feedback is that orderboards are starting to push out. So how do you weigh that -- balance that against a market outlook that's flat? I guess, it ultimately gets to thelegitimacy of that product."
35,64389214,AGCO CORPORATION,02/22/2018," 1:45PM, AGCO",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,Senior VP & CFO,True,False,"Yes, I think confidence is good there. As you've mentioned, we have a good order board situation there. I think we go back to, again, the economicsof the customers and where they stand -- profitability of where they stand. Commodity prices are on their lower level on -- the grain farmers hada very rough 2016, some are still kind of clawing their way back from that period. So some of them are still not in -- going to be in an aggressivebuying position at this point. But I would say that confidence is improving. Their harvests were better or expect to be better for the '17 harvest.And so all those things are moving in the right direction. And we talked already about dairy, whereas there was a recovery, there is some concernthat the dairy market pricing will start to pull back a little because of higher production levels. And so those are the factors that I think kind of keepus at more of a steady state rather than something that's going to have another step up. But certainly, as you say, the confidence is pretty good,customers are ordering, dealers are in a good position right now. And so that market, we hope, will continue to drive earnings improvement forus."
