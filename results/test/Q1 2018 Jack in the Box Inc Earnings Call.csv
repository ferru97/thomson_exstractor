2,64388865,JACK IN THE BOX INC.,02/22/2018," 4:30PM, JACK",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Leonard A. Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,Chairman of the Board & CEO,False,True,"Thank you, Carol, and good morning. We're continuing to work with Apollo on completing the sale of Qdoba, which we're expecting will occur byApril, though we will not be discussing that brand's performance during our comments this morning. As for Jack in the Box, our financial performancein the first quarter was solid overall and in line with our expectations. System same-store sales decreased slightly in Q1 as we rolled over a 3.1%increase last year, which was our best quarter of fiscal 2017. But we saw a sequential improvement in both sales and traffic in Q1, and importantly,company restaurant margins remained strong as a result of our refranchising efforts, which offset both commodity and wage inflation. In addition,G&A continued to decline as we focus on becoming a more nimble organization.     This morning, I'd like to talk about some of the restaurant initiatives underway to drive traffic and sales, and to update you on some leadershipchanges at our company, as well as how I see the flattening of our organizational structure impacting G&A. When it comes to service improvements,whether we're enhancing our restaurant facilities or developing digital solutions, it's imperative that we meet our guest's evolving expectations.Within our restaurants, we believe there are ways to find efficiencies to ensure that our 4 walls economics makes sense for our franchisees overthe long term. Though we'll be working with them to accelerate the testing of several pieces of new equipment and processes.     As for digital, we know that if it adds complexity to our operations, we've made a mistake. The app we've been successfully testing does exactlywhat consumers want today. They can easily view our menu, order, schedule pickup and pay. We also want to be able to easily integrate otherfeatures with the app when appropriate, such as delivery. We're heading in the right direction with our app, and we believe we'll be in a positionto roll it out systemwide by the end of the year.     Next, innovation. In the past, you've seen us focus most of our menu innovation around premium products, like the ribeye burger, which helpeddrive sales in Q1, or the food truck sandwiches that Martha Stewart helped us launch during this month's Super Bowl. What you'll see going forward,is that we're going to continue to innovate our own premium products, but also value-based products. The $2 breakfast pockets that we promotedin Q1 as a secondary value message are a great example of being in your value messaging to the menu with a completely new item.     When it comes to value, we typically offered value bundles that are promoted via second-tier messaging to the marketplace. However, in January,we began promoting several bundled offerings ranging from $1 to $5 price points as our primarily media message. Most of the traffic loss in Q1continue to be driven by transactions less than $5, but our value promotions, including the $2 breakfast pockets, helps drive an incrementalimprovement in under $5 transactions versus Q4.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Since the end of Q4, we've expanded the delivery to include anadditional 478 restaurants. We're now delivering Jack in the Box food from nearly 63% of our system. And we're expecting additional restaurantsto begin offering delivery over the course of the year. We continue to see an incremental sales lift in markets where delivery is offered.     Another major restaurant initiative is elevating the brand image though remodels and new construction. We have about 600 restaurants that I'dkindly describe as mature. These restaurants typically have roof lines more than 40 years old, that date the branch and really need to change. Theinvestments that we'll make will largely be tiered, depending on sales levels, meaning locations with lower AUVs will get less investment thanthose with higher AUVs. You'll see us in partnership with our franchisees implemented over the next 4 years.     Moving on to refranchising. We sold 22 Jack in the Box restaurants to franchisees during first quarter, bringing the system to nearly 89% franchisedat quarter end. We have approximately 60 restaurants with signed LOIs, and continue to expect the Jack in the Box franchise mix will reachapproximately 95% by the end of fiscal 2018.     This morning, I'd like to update you on the leadership changes we recently announced, and our plans to continue flattening the organization aswe evolve our company. Our leadership team is already looking different from what it was at the beginning of the year. Earlier this month, FrancesAllen resigned after leading the brand as President for more than 3 years. She anticipated the need to flatten the organization, and graciouslysuggested that the elimination of her position, so that we can more quickly begin restructuring the brand (inaudible).     Another important change was the addition of Marcus Tom, who joined us this month as Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Marcus bringssignificant restaurant industry experience in operations leadership position, and will be a key piece of our refocused executive team.     And finally, I want to acknowledge that this will be Jerry Rebel's final call with us. As you know, Jerry informed us last year of his desire to retire andmove to Texas so that he could be closer to his family. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Jerry for nearly 15 years of service to the company,and to wish him all the best in honing his golf game in Texas."

Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,Chairman of the Board & CEO,False,True,"Our new CFO, Lance Tucker, starts at the end of March. Lance will be joining us from Papa John's International, where he is currently Senior VicePresident, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer. Following the expected sale of Qdoba, we'll still need to provide services to thatbrand until it becomes completely independent. When that happens, we'll be in a better position to continue restructuring the company and focusexclusively on the Jack in the Box brand.     As we continue to restructure the business, we believe we can lower G&A to less than 2% of systemwide sales. As we approach the back half of theyear, we expect to be ready to discuss the timing of G&A reductions and other long-term guidance, including free cash flow targets.     And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry for a more detailed look at the first quarter and an update on guidance for the year. Jerry?"
5,64388865,JACK IN THE BOX INC.,02/22/2018," 4:30PM, JACK",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Jerry P. Rebel,Jack in the Box Inc.,Executive VP & CFO,False,True,"Thank you, Lenny, and good morning, everyone. As we noted in the press release, there were several items that made this quarter a bit messierthan usual. When you get beyond the noise, it was relatively clean quarter from an operating standpoint. But before I get into the operating results,I will quickly summarize the items that created the noise. First of all, Qdoba results are shown as discontinued operations for all periods presented,including the Qdoba direct level G&A. However, shared service G&A, which supports both the Jack in the Box brand and the Qdoba brand, remainsin continuing operations.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

This negatively impacted GAAP EPS by $1.03 per share. Third, there was an accounting change thatrequires us to now treat excess tax benefits from share-based compensations as a component of the tax provision versus additional paid-in capitalin the past. This positively impacted GAAP EPS by $0.03 per share.     And lastly, with the increasing focus on EBITDA, we have reclassified all depreciation and amortization to a separate line on the P&L. You can seehow this impacted our previously reported metrics, including restaurant operating margins and franchise margin in the non-GAAP reconciliationsincluded in the press release.     Moving on to our operating results for the quarter. Operating EPS was $1.23 as compared to $1.07 last year, driven primarily by a lower tax rate, areduction in the share count and a decrease in G&A, which were partially offset by the impact of refranchising. The tax act reduced our federalstatutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, resulting in a blended statutory federal rate of 24.5% for each quarter of our fiscal year,including state taxes, our adjusted Q1 effective tax rate was 28.8% and our estimated tax rate for the fiscal year will be approximately 29%.     Jack in the Box system same-store sales declined 0.2% in Q1. This 0.2% -- the 0.2% increase in company same-store sales was comprised of pricingof approximately 1.6%, mixed benefits of 1% and a decline in transactions of 2.4%. Franchise same-store sales declined 0.3% for the quarter. Jackin the Box company restaurant margins of 22.2% increased by 60 basis points compared to last year, with wage and commodity inflation eachabove 5% in the quarter. Restaurant operating margin for the stores we intend to keep after refranchising is complete, was 24.6% in the quarter.Excluding depreciation, company restaurant level EBITDA increased by 20 basis points to 26%.     Franchise EBITDA increased by 8.5% to $76 million, due primarily to refranchising. In G&A, excluding depreciation, declined to approximately 2.4%of systemwide sales as compared to 2.7% last year. Our leverage ratio was approximately 3.3x as of the end of the quarter. We are working withour advisors to adjust our capital structure to reflect a less capital-intensive business model. As we said previously at a 95% franchise mix, we arecomfortable taking our leverage up to 5x EBITDA as opposed to the 4x we are limited to under our current credit facilities. Although we did notrepurchase any shares during the quarter, weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 8% versus last year's first quarter. We have approximately$181 million remaining share repurchase authorization from our Board, and we plan to resume buying back our stock.     Moving on to guidance. Our systemwide sales guidance range for the second quarter is down 1% to up 1%. Through the first 4 weeks of our secondquarter we are tracking within the range guided.     Fiscal year guidance we provided at ICR, and January is unchanged.     That concludes our prepared remarks. I'd like to turn the call over to our operator to open it up for questions. Teresa?"

Let me handle the capital structure piece question first. I think you would expect to have some update from us, assuming like you said,the -- the day the transaction closes in April, I would expect that you'd see something in terms of capital structure within the May meeting, and Ithink Lenny will take the second part of that question."

If we look at long-term guidance overall and any update to -- with our strategic planning, what you can expect to see happen is in conjunctionwith Lance joining the company at the end of the March time frame, the closing of Qdoba in April, you'll see a sense of urgency from us to updatethose plans and be able to get information out to all of you as soon as possible. But we do want to take one step at a time, get our new CFO inposition and work through the close which is targeted for April, but we'll make sure that, that happens before we update any long-term plans. Soyou'll see, as you've seen in the past from us, whether it be with a restructuring or G&A reduction effort, a sense of urgency on our part to movequickly, to get to our new state."

Inc., Research Division",MD and Senior Analyst,True,False,"Okay. And just last question, can you just talk a little bit more about your same-store sales guidance of 1% to 2%, what's driving that full yearoutlook, given it is better than the flattish 1Q results and kind of the flattish 2Q guide, and just any comments on how your single price point valuestrategy is going would be helpful."
11,64388865,JACK IN THE BOX INC.,02/22/2018," 4:30PM, JACK",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Leonard A. Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,Chairman of the Board & CEO,True,False,"Yes, let me handle the single price point strategy. It's -- I would call it a tactic more than a strategy. We had major competitive activity in, particularlyin January that we wanted to make sure we were proactive in addressing versus, wait until the end of the quarter to see how it played out. So, Imean the tactic worked well for us, something that we'll repeat if necessary in the future, but it won't be the only tactic, so. And I don't believe thatwill be consistent with a multiple price point value promotion going forward, but it certainly has shown us that we have some other tools in thetool belt that we can pull out when necessary. Beyond that, when you look at the confidence for the back half of the year, I'd say is, I've just spentthe last 2 days and what's interesting about what I'm about to say is, it's fun being a CEO of this company, it's been a great company to work for,but one of the things I've missed the last few years is my involvement in the day-to-day operations and marketing decisions which, with Frances'departure, I'm now extremely involved in and getting more intimate with. And the last couple of days I've had a lot of fun with my franchisees inthe kitchen, working alongside my marketing group and my R&D group to shore up the back half of this year's marketing calendar. And we lookat what we're going to do in Q3, we've got 2 great offerings. One would be a completely new offering that the we've tested, it's a snack item thatwill come in at a lower price point, but it's a nice quantity of food with pretty exciting packaging and also very indulgent line of products. So we'lloffer that. And then on top of that we've got a great bundle item that we'll put together. We're not sharing specifically what we're going to do atthis time, for competitive reasons, but we're all excited about the line up in that quarter, and in addition to that, the franchisees agreed to havethe entire system focus on an average check builder, that we'll be doing through upscaling at every restaurant. It will be some items on our menuthat are unique to Jack in the Box. So when we get the type of engagement from our operators, it's reason to be optimistic and excited. And thenin the last quarter of the year, we're going to move away from sandwiches and promote some of the things that we think we have a license topromote, as a QSR player that has a pretty huge variety on its menu. And so we're going to do things that are differentiated and that make us standout and we're going to actually extend one of the offerings that we currently have to bring some new news and excitement to an old product. Soreally excited about that, we're going to bundle that as well in a combo meal. And again, when you look at what will be in that combo, besides forthe drink, the other items that will be in that combo are unique to Jack in the Box, so. When we look at a lineup like that, and engagement fromour operators, this is where we get excited about the back half of the year."

14,64388865,JACK IN THE BOX INC.,02/22/2018," 4:30PM, JACK",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Dennis Geiger,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",Director and Equity Research Analyst of Restaurants,True,False,"Thanks for the question, and Jerry, congrats and best of luck. Lenny, just wondering if you could talk a bit more, maybe about franchisee sentimentand profitability right now, maybe some of the perceptions around the new value construct, what they're saying? And then, just building that onthat, just as it relates to what you're seeing from a development commitment standpoint? I know there was some commentary, but just how you'rethinking about that associated with the refranchisings as we go through the year?"
15,64388865,JACK IN THE BOX INC.,02/22/2018," 4:30PM, JACK",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Leonard A. Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,Chairman of the Board & CEO,True,False,"Yes. So I'll answer the last part of your question first. When we look at the refranchising effort that we're currently initiating, there may be somedevelopment agreements that happened with that but that's not the major thrust of that activity. So unlike what we did last year, where we actuallyslowed down the refranchising activity in order to get development deals signed, this won't look a little different. So we may marginally get some,an uptick in development, but I wouldn't expect that to be a major driver of our business. When you look at franchisee sentiment, essentially, whatthey're experiencing is rising labor costs and it's putting pressure on their P&Ls, and their major focus is really to drive sales and transactions, toallow them to lever their business positively. So we, and -- I'm not -- that's one of the reasons why I've been excited to get close to the businessand close to them, in working through those issues. So again, I said, when you see the type of engagement we experienced over the last 2 days, Imean it was beyond just the back half of the year, it was also examining what the product pipeline would and could look like going forward into2019. I would say that our franchisees are optimistic about the future, but also concerned about their current financial health and want to makesure that the franchise owner is working side-by-side with them, to ensure that they will have a healthy business over the long term.     As far as -- one last thing with the franchisees. As far as their interest in refranchising, that has not waned, and their overall financial health is good,but they certainly don't want to see any deterioration in their margin over time, but we still have a significant interest in -- from our franchisees ingetting the remaining sites that we'll be refranchising."

So maybeyou could just remind us how the quarter, a year ago progressed? And therefore, if you've faced other comparisons in the back half just of thisquarter, how you plan to handle that? And Lenny, I think in your comments, you talked about tactics in January sort of like, it was contained toJanuary from a competitive intensity standpoint. You don't necessarily have to be as intense going forward. Is that the case? Do you feel like thediscounting intensity has waned as we've gotten into February? Or is that -- was that not a correct read of that."

Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,Chairman of the Board & CEO,True,False,"I don't think the discounting intensity has waned, but I think we're seeing a couple of things that would tell us it may wane. So first off, whathappened in January was really just us playing a little bit of defense and making sure that we didn't get caught standing flat-footed in the face ofwhat we knew to be is a pretty extensive, competitive activity. I don't think that the activity is necessarily going to wane overall. But the tactics thatwe may deploy against it may be a little different. Our franchisees, what they're seeing is that when we launch premium products well, that's a     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

And so for them, it's really important that there's a balance over time, as it is for us, the balance overtime and focusing on value and premium. And in many cases, we found that when we lean into premium, such as when we launched the ButteryJack, we actually are getting more success with that than what seems to be a more [possessive] play when we lean into value. So I think you'regoing to see a healthy balance going forward. When you look at Q1 transactions for our company stores, it improved from down 5.4% to down2.4%, so we think what we did was the right thing, to sort of protect our business and regain some share. But ultimately, when you look at the trendthroughout this quarter and into the back half of the year, with the lineup that we have in place, we remain optimistic that we can deliver."

So there was a lot of chatter last year this time aboutthe delay in tax refunds and from what we can see thus far this year, there hasn't been any improvement or degradation in those trends, but theback half of the quarter was obviously, much more positive than the first part of the quarter last year."

And if I could just sneak one more. The G&A targets you're giving now is just the pure G&A versus -- that had some D&A in it before. So it'snot an enormous number, but maybe it's $8 million on an annualized basis. So are you looking more favorably on your G&A for the year? Or is thatjust within the wiggle room of the 2.5% to 2.7% of system sales, so it's not really material to call out?"

It's within the wiggle room that we provided within the range. If you look at what it was last year, it was just under 20 basispoints of D&A, which was in the G&A category. So the target that we have, the longer-term target that we talked about at ICR is less than 2% ofsystemwide sales, I'd consider that to be cash G&A. So we have excluded the depreciation and amortization, and we also think that, that's a veryconsistent reporting approach within the period, within the industry here. So that's how we're looking at it."

Are you assuming that the environment changes or gets better as you move throughthe year? And I guess related to that, consumers are starting to see lower taxes on their paychecks, so I was wondering if you are assuming anybenefit from that, or if that would be upside relative to your current plans?     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

So current plans do not assume that there's some catalyst that drives performance. We do expect the environment to be just as competitivein the back half of the year as it's been, really, over the last couple of years. And so if you look at what we're planning to do in Q3, for example, thetwo things that we'll be promoting. One, more on the premium side, and one more of a sort of snack or value item. Both will be price pointpromotions, which we don't typically do. We typically have one price point promotion out in the marketplace and another that's sort of unpriced,typically focused on premium. We will, in this case, have competitive pricing on both of the offerings as really some of the additional sort of drivers,or the offerings. So I think our expectation is that it's going to be a competitive market and we really can't afford to take our foot off the gas."

And then on the G&A reductions, I know you mentioned that we'll more clarification on the timing of those. But I guess, canyou give some high level perspective on how that transition services arrangement works? Is the right way to think about this that you could havesort of minimal or low G&A reductions over the, relative with our current run rate over the next year, and then you'd see a step down after thetransition services arrangement ends?"

So -- well as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the our shared service G&A, even thatwhich currently supports Qdoba, is in our continuing operations. Right after we close the deal, we will begin to receive proceeds from Apollo forthe shared services that we're providing for them as part of transition services agreement. It's likely that, that will be shown to offset the G&A theway we would report that, but even if it doesn't, if we try to figure out exactly how that's going to look going forward, we will be very transparentabout showing you what the income level is, or the offsets is to that G&A from the transition services compensation that we're getting from Apollo.So you will see a reduction related to that and at least, the back half of the year or post closing."

There is no rate, there is no change in the rental rate on the extra rental flow-through would comefrom the increase in the same-store sales that we would get from, resulting from the remodel. The way that we looked at the tenant improvementallowance, I go back to one of the things that Lenny said in his prepared remarks, which is this tiered approach on the overall investment cost,which is based upon sales of higher AUV restaurants, they're going to get a higher investment, they'll get a higher tenant improvement allowance,     9     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

But the way that we looked at this is, we applied the same investmentthreshold for the tenant improvement allowance for us that we did for our own remodel investment cost for the company-operated restaurants.And so, and the hurdle that we were looking at there was a 15% return on that investment, whether or not it's a tenant improvement allowanceor a CapEx for company locations, Chris."

I -- what will be, Iguess, the stores you keep, post refranchising, what do you expect their restaurant level margins to be now on an ongoing basis, given the changein the D&A, is it just, it's taking 4% and adding it on to sort of what had previously guided a fair way to think about it?"

It has been tested, and it tested very favorably in themarketplace where we tested it. It's also a significant amount of food, provided at very reasonable price. So we can see consumer sentiment aboutit is very positive. It's also extremely indulgent, and sort of true to Jack. Something that we can deliver from our menu that many others can't.

Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,Chairman of the Board & CEO,True,False,"I guess what I would say is, we've been doing a fair amount of research on where consumers historically find the most value on our menu. And notsurprisingly, our taco offering has been quite popular, it also turned out to be quite popular within our $1 to $4 offering. And if there are lessonslearned, it would really be along the lines of what we can do to enhance our sales through featuring tacos. And so, that's sort of one big thing. Asfar as the other offerings, when we have things like breakfast pockets that are sort of new news, they're a sort of innovation for us, but they're alsoshow up in our value price point. We tend to do a little bit better with those products as well. We tend to take existing products and since wediscount them, although we'll get a higher take rate, we also have to be careful about what the impact is to margin, so those aren't necessarily themost preferred method. And when we bundle items with a drink, a side and an entr�e, that historically, had been our best play. So I think whenwe come out of this $1 through $5 price point time frame, some of the things that we've seen are right in concert with what we've sort of alwaysknown. When we look at, behaviorally, the consumers' take rate on our taco offerings within that $1 to $5 price point, it gives us some optimismabout what we may be able to do with tacos in the future."

I mean, many of your peers contemplate whether a single brandor a multi-brand portfolio is the right strategy, going from multi to single. I'm just wondering what do you think are the greatest benefits you'regoing to lose from going back down to single? On the opposite side of that, I guess, what would be the biggest benefit you think you'd gain fromnot running a multi-brand portfolio?"

Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,Chairman of the Board & CEO,True,False,"I think if we, if we really take -- if we're being completely transparent and honest, The Street never fully embraced Jack in the Box being a multibrandedconcept. And so, we grew this thing from 86 units to 700-plus units in that entire time frame, 10-plus years. We never fully got acceptance of thisbusiness model. At the end of the day, you had competing interests, right? On the one hand, you want at the asset like business. And on the otherhand, you have this growth business. And they don't, from an investment community standpoint, work hand-in-hand, they're not clean. So if there'sone lesson learned about it, it would be that this type of model, in a publicly-traded situation, probably doesn't make sense because it's just toocomplex. And so what we lose, I think we lose EBITDA, right? At the end of the day, the -- look, you have a business, was generating some positivecash flow for us, that created some efficiencies on the G&A side and we're going to have to relook at how we, you know, run the model goingforward. But I think, outside of those things, net-net, moving to one brand will turn out to be a very positive thing for our business.     We're going to be a much more agile company, with a leaner structure with fewer layers to go through to get things done. And that's sort of whatour roots are, it fuels a lot of our innovation. And I experienced that this week, right? We've already begun to engage franchisees differently. Wehave all these committees that existed for both brands that got managed by brand services leaders, as well as brand leaders, and that all flatteneddown to essentially me and my direct reports working directly with franchisees on the future of the company. It seems easy, it seems like we canmove much faster than we typically do. And we sat around this same table that I'm at today, talking to you, talking to franchisees about the futureand product innovation and also equipment testing. It was amazing how open they were to taking risks that would help us to accelerate ourperformance. So from that standpoint, I think yesterday, when I walked out of 2 full-day sessions with franchisees, several folks are saying, how areyou doing? Are you tired? You seem extremely energized at this point. I mean, I am, because my franchisees are excited, they're engaged, we'removing much faster. It seems that what has taken us weeks or months to make, we made in 2 days. And so net-net, I think our leadership teamswould tell you, and I will tell you, this will turn out to be a net positive for us. We're just much closer to the business, and I'm excited personally, tobe much closer to them."

I understand there's a lot of factors that go into, when you would do that, given franchiseeprofitability, your contributions, the type of remodel. But how do you think that trends over the next 4 years? Is that something where you do a lotof cheaper, lower AUV remodels up front? Or is it something that just takes 4 years, and you just do a quarter of those remodels per year?     14     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Rebel,Jack in the Box Inc.,Executive VP & CFO,True,False,"So we -- it won't work the way you described, where we kind of do cheaper up front. It'll be dispersed in a way that really had some of the moreexpensive remodels happening earlier in the process. And then later in the process, I think we'll not only be faster at getting them done, but they'llbe the less intensive ones. And really, what that comes down to is some of the buildings that we will remodel early in the process just require morework and more time. So they're a little more costly, and they have some downtime associated with them. Some of the sites that we will remodellater in the process, we won't have to shut those sites down completely. The drive-thrus will remain open, and we can sort of work around thedrive-thru to get that work done. So maybe a little more intense and expensive for the earlier remodels, is the way you should think about."

If the adjusted effective rate was 28.8%, I believe you said in the first quarter.In the full year guidance, still 29%. But in the first quarter, you would've had, most of that quarter would've had the higher 35% federal rate. Andfor the rest of the year, you should be at the lower 21% federal rate, why is the guide for the year still 29%?"
67,64388865,JACK IN THE BOX INC.,02/22/2018," 4:30PM, JACK",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Jerry P. Rebel,Jack in the Box Inc.,Executive VP & CFO,True,False,"The way that you have to do this is, you're really looking at the overall blended rate for the entire year, and that's what the rate is for each quarter.And so what you basically are seeing is, for the year and for each quarter is, 1 calendar quarter at 35%, 3 calendar quarters at 21%, but that is shownevenly throughout the year, for each quarter. It's not logical, but that's the way that you have to do it."

Andkind of what the thought is there? And what your initial impression is of what they're doing with the business, as far as sales go?"
70,64388865,JACK IN THE BOX INC.,02/22/2018," 4:30PM, JACK",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Leonard A. Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,Chairman of the Board & CEO,True,False,"Yes. So we, so first of all, I'd say, the food truck series really represents 2 things: One, I'd say from an advertising standpoint, Jack's got his swaggerback. I mean, we had gotten, I think, a little too conservative in the way we use Jack in our advertising. Frances really, along with our Chief MarketingOfficer, [Ivana], started pushing for us to get a little more aggressive and back to the old personality for Jack. And I think it played really well, andI think bringing in Martha Stewart played really well. It's more in line with the persona that helped us cut through a lot of advertising noise, eventhough we're a regional player. So I think the first headline is on an advertising side, has worked extremely well, and it's also indicative of what youcan expect to see from us going forward. As far as product development, really happy with the food truck series. It has done well for us, but I thinkwe can do even better, and after spending a couple of days with my franchisees, if we were to evaluate the food truck series today, versus themonths passed before we launched it, we may have actually doubled down on even more protein on those sandwiches than we're currentlyoffering, in order to ramp up the quantity in the sandwich. And we looked at similar sandwiches and even line extensions for food truck series theselast couple of days, where all of us were aligned around really wanting to knock the customer's socks off when they bite into these sandwiches. Sothat might mean price points have to change in the future, in order to achieve that level of quality. But I think, if we're going to have to be aggressiveon the value side, we don't want to lose our brand equities that we've built up on the quantity side, and so it's going to be important that wecontinue to put these wild products out there. I would say on a scale of 1 to 10, food truck series, maybe it's a 7, and I think we can get to a 10 ifwe're willing to commit fully to high-quality items going forward.     15     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

But -- so look, we understand the need for the restated quarterly numbers versus Qdoba, as discontinued ops andmore importantly, the Jack standalone piece. We will get something out there to you, we just can't commit to a time at this point, but we understandthe need, and we'll get it to you as soon as we can."

74,64388865,JACK IN THE BOX INC.,02/22/2018," 4:30PM, JACK",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Karen Holthouse,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",VP,True,False,"One quick housekeeping question on the model. If I try and reconcile for 1Q '17 G&A that was -- or SG&A that was reported last year versus therestated number this year, it looks like it's about $15 million lower. Taking out the DNA that got reallocated and Qdoba advertising, I end up withabout a little over $6 million, that seems to be allocated to Qdoba. But I'm trying to reconcile that with what you said it was sort of a $14.2 millionQdoba allocation back at ICR, because it would seem like that $6 million would annualize to something a lot higher."
75,64388865,JACK IN THE BOX INC.,02/22/2018," 4:30PM, JACK",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Jerry P. Rebel,Jack in the Box Inc.,Executive VP & CFO,True,False,"Yes, Karen. So actually, I appreciate getting that information before the call, so I was able to a look at it. The roughly $6 million that you had isallocated, it's really not allocated. I had a slightly different number, but we're in the ballpark. That was direct Qdoba brand G&A, and that would beconsistent with what the direct Qdoba brand G&A was for the full year, because I think we said, that was $14.2 million. The reason that you can'tannualize that is because the first quarter of last year, Qdoba had a cost in there for an assumed incentive payment at their target levels. And bythe time we got to the end of the year with the Qdoba performance, there was no target level or there really wasn't much of an incentive compensationpayment at all. So you really can't look at the roughly $6 million of direct G&A in Q1 and extrapolate that, so. But the $14.2 million was the rightdirect Qdoba G&A for last year. I think you're close enough for the quarter."

And then one of the things we were talking about at this point last year was some weakness in the Hispanic consumer onthe back of the election. I know that's a demographic that you over indexed to. What are you seeing there? And then you -- is there, sort of whatare you seeing in the trends there? And how do you think about, sort of spending patterns last year in the, call it, Hispanic consumer comparisonin the coming months, versus where we are now?"

Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,Chairman of the Board & CEO,True,False,"I don't think that we're seeing anything currently, that would create concern about the strength of the Hispanic consumer, more so than theconcerns we would have over an abundance of value in the marketplace, and the high take rates associated with that value, and its difficultly inbreaking through some of that noise, at times. But I don't know the specifics about the Hispanic consumer's strength, but we certainly don't haveany data points at this point in time that would tell us that something has changed dramatically, but it's certainly is something we'll continue totake a look at.     16     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

I guess, also in, Lenny, when you're looking at the remodels and in years past, other companies, not necessarily you guys, you've done a greatjob of not having a lot of closings, but other companies that had some closings pick up when they have remodels and the context of the inflationthat's out there and the value promotion, do you model in there with the longer-term growth projections the potential for a pickup and closings,or have you already sort of vetted the temperature of the franchise network?"

So Matt, with the refranchising that we've done, that's really where a lot of the vetting in terms of closing discount. Ourguidance that we give on unit growth is gross and not net. It's typically the stores that we're closing are obviously much lower volume. But whenwe look at the remodels, we're not going to put in a lot of capital into a store that we think is not worthy of those sorts of investments, that's it'snot going to be in the long-term plan."
