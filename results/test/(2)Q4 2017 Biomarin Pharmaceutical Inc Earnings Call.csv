As I said in my prepared remarks, the patient interest is phenomenal in this and we, more or less, essentially identifiedan abundant -- a sufficiently abundant pool of patients to enroll. The gating factor is site activation, contracts, IRBs, et cetera, that'sprogressing smoothly as predicted and our projection is that we'll complete enrollment in the first of the 2 studies by the end of theyear with the second study coming in after that. So although it's early, we're quite pleased with the track record of enrollment andpatient identification."

So in the pipeline one, Hank, I wanted to ask about BMN 250 and how much follow-up youthink you need there before potentially moving to the pivotal program. Is that the 1-year DQ data you've just mentioned? And thenI guess on that front, what do you hope to see on that side to move forward? Is stabilization of DQ enough or you need improvement,too? And then, I have a follow-up for commercial."

Fuchs,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,President of Worldwide Research & Development,False,True,"It's a little early to talk about the pivot to a subsequent study. I think what I -- the context I'd put on things now is that just a reminderthat Brineura got approved in the United States on the basis of 96-week data and in Europe on the basis of 72-week data. And finally,it was triggered actually on the basis of 48-week data, big credit goes to the health authorities for being able to include more updateddata in the package inserts on the basis of relatively rapid real-time review. So in the context of Brineura, 48 weeks by itself wasenough. I -- we don't know about the efficacy of the full cohort of patients at 48 weeks, so that's why it's premature to speculate. Butwhat I'd say is, is that based on Brineura, we have made substantial improvements in the 250 programs. Specifically, we're using thesame exact tool to measure outcome in a natural history context as in the treatment context. We're measuring those developmentquotient improvements in the same patients, not different patients. Those were -- that was a big part of the Brineura review andwe've eliminated that as a concern for the 250 application. In addition, unlike Brineura, in the case of 250, there's a very good biomarkerfor biological activity of the product. And finally, unlike with Brineura where there were no systemic manifestations of the diseaseto follow, we've already demonstrated normalization of liver size, which I'll remind you, has been a basis of approval for other enzymereplacement therapies. So we're cautiously optimistic about the progress we've made with 250. I think that we're ahead of wherewe were at a similar time in the case of Brineura and as to kind of what magnitude of improvement would trigger either anotherstudy or an application, I think it's a matter of stay tuned."

And then on the commercial front, assuming that pegvaliase is, indeed, approved in May, I can appreciate theslow and steady initial launch curve, but how should we be thinking about some of the headwinds and tailwinds for this product?What do you see as the biggest needle movers there that we should be thinking about?"

We have over 200 clinical trial patients, a majority of which we would expect to be able to transition tocommercial during the course of the year, assuming an approval date on or around our PDUFA. So that's a tailwind. For na�ve to     9     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

That would be something like a 12- to 24-week periodon average, but also noting that some patients have taken longer than 24 weeks to reach a maintenance phase. During that periodof time, patients will be taking a variety of doses. So we've got 3 prefilled syringe SKUs, we would anticipate a 2.5-microgram, a10-microgram and a 20-microgram dose. And so depending on the dosing schedule, there would be fractional revenues during theinduction titration phase, starting out at 1 syringe per week early in the induction and titration phase. So only fractional revenueduring induction and titration. And that would eat up the majority of the calendar year of 2018 for na�ve to treatment patients. Soif you consider that to be a bit of a headwind. In terms of new patient enrollment, 35 of the 125 PKU clinics in the United States haveexperience using pegvaliase through the clinical trial program. So that gives us a good base of experience to start off from. And weknow that those investigators are interested in trialing new patients when pegvaliase is approved. We also know that they've guidedthat they would start patients in relatively small batches. Think several -- or several-ish. Work them up through the initial inductionand titration phase to something approaching maintenance dosing and then starting the next batch of patients and so on. So thatwill be kind of a measured pace of new patient introduction of the pegvaliase. And then for the about 90 PKU clinics in the UnitedStates that don't have experience through the clinical trial program, we have the usual education process to get through before wewould anticipate they would trial patients. We would anticipate and, in fact, guide those clinics to start with several-ish patients, bevery deliberate about having good experiences, good initial experiences with pegvaliase and then starting additional patients. Soit will be a measured start throughout 2018."

Just first, I'm curious on the decision to wait on starting a pediatric programuntil there's an approval in adults. I think you guys have said that for a while. Can you maybe clarify, is this driven by FDA's directionor is this your decision? And I guess, the reason I'm asking is it's kind of striking with today's announcement that you're starting aninfant study for visoritide, sort of why not apply maybe the same logic to pegvaliase? And then maybe on the commercial side, I wasstruck by your comments that revenue for titration patients would be fractional. I thought I heard you guys say earlier that you wouldnot be pricing this on a per milligram basis and rather by SKUs. Can you maybe give a little bit more color? Should we think aboutit in terms of the amount of drug? Or is there some other measure?"

Fuchs,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,President of Worldwide Research & Development,False,True,"Sure, thanks, Chris. The considerations with pegvaliase has all along been -- it's a foreign protein that's PEGylated within an elicitedimmune response. We really wanted to build a good safety database before going into children. And that is an especially importantconsideration in the context in which there is an alternative form of therapy for children, namely medical and nutritional therapy.And that's different -- that's one aspect that's different from our other indications and another -- and therefore, sort of the ongoing     10     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

So I think those things,those 2 things combined, the nature of the product and wanting to build a really strong safety database as well as the availabilityof medical and nutritional, the compliance with medical and nutritional therapy, which is higher in children than it is in adults,suggests to us to take a more measured approach with these children. Now upon regulatory action, clearly, that can be revisited.     And Chris, on the subject of why the fractional revenue during the induction and titration phase. Thinking about pegvaliase patientsin a maintenance setting where they would likely be receiving either 20-milligram or 40-milligram per day maintenance dosing, wewould be pricing principally on expectations of how to price for maintenance dosing. I mentioned earlier that we're anticipatingthat we would have 3 different prefilled syringe SKUs, 2.5-milligram syringe, 10-milligram syringe and 20-milligram syringe. In theUnited States, the most likely method of pricing pegvaliase would be either pricing on a per milligram basis or pricing on a persyringe basis. In the maintenance space dose setting, imagine a 20-milligram per day patient receiving 1 20-milligram syringe perday. In an induction and titration phase, same patient would be starting out at 1 2.5-milligram syringe, once a week, and the frequencyof that syringe use increasing, getting to the point of switching to a 10-milligram syringe and then all the way up to a daily dose of20-milligram in this case. So whether we price on a per syringe basis or a per milligram basis, during the induction and titrationphase, the patients would be getting a fractional price essentially during that period. And that fractional piece would be shiftingfrom very low in the range initially to higher in the range as they get further through the induction of the titration process."

I too had actually a couple of pegvaliase questions. One question is about training the centers that didnot participate in the clinical trials. Do you have a plan in place for how you expect to train them? And can you talk about maybe atime line for when you expect these centers to go online? And just to clarify, you said that they will -- the centers that are alreadyonline will treat several [LISH] patients in the beginning. So do you expect them to take on these patients and then take them throughthe induction titration period before they start maintenance trial and then only take on new patients?"

Fuchs,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,President of Worldwide Research & Development,False,True,"Maybe I'll start and Jeff can chime in. As far as the broadening from the 35 to 125, clearly, the 35 centers who have a lot of hands-onexperience with pegvaliase have learned a lot. And we've captured a lot of that learning and we intend to apply that learning to theother 90 that we need to bring online. And yes, we have quite detailed plans, but in the current moment, what I want to say aboutthat is, we can't really speak about what those detailed plans are until the label for the product is final. So I think the context I'll leaveyou with, in the moment is, you better believe, we've got seriously detailed plans for how to extend the learnings from the 35 to the125. And as to how the commercial team is going to operationalize and build on that, maybe Jeff wants to take over."

I think, thank you, Hank. A couple of the things that I think will be impactful in year 1 for the na�ve to experience clinics are, one,what we would anticipate is a kind of a guidelines document to be published shortly after pegvaliase approval. We'll receive it atthe end of May. That would be one piece. And that the second piece would be to find kind of peer-to-peer opportunities to leveragethe experience of the clinical trial investigators to share with their non-experienced peers some tips and guidance on workingthrough their initial patients. In terms of the induction and titration phase, the maintenance and the notion of starting severalpatients, several [LISH] patients, getting them through the induction-titration phase before starting additional patients, what we'veheard the clinical trial investigators say is that, it's exactly the 12- to 24-week period that is normal for induction and titration, that     11     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Once they getthrough those, the dose adjustments and period where adverse events are most likely to occur, then the workload on those patientsgoes down significantly. And it's exactly at that point that we would anticipate clinics would be receptive to starting additionalpatients into the induction and titration phase again."

The pegvaliase comments in your prepared remarks, you mentioned cautious optimismand you specifically mentioned the FDA getting comfortable with immune reactions. It seemed like your comments are a bit morecautious today than maybe what we've heard in the past. I'm just curious what was the reason for that? Is that coming from yourinteractions with the FDA or are you simply erring on the side of conservatism?"

Fuchs,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,President of Worldwide Research & Development,False,True,"The latter. Just -- we're 3 months away from a PDUFA date and it isn't over until it's over. But I think it's worth providing a little bitmore color on kind of the review process. The tone of interaction is really positive. The (inaudible) review divisional report closelywith a lot -- we had a patient-oriented drug development meeting that they requested, where they got a chance to hear from patientsfor real, on their own, in terms of what the benefit of fee lowering is, what's the disadvantages of current therapy -- benefit andnutritional therapy are, that agency had an opportunity to dig in, in detail about what are the adverse experiences like? What ismanagement of the adverse experiences like? What are you looking for patients in the long haul? And I think that interaction wasvery positive and people came away enthusiastic. As you know, from public disclosures of the FDA process, the FDA undertakesmany activities in parallel during the late stages in review, which include consideration of post-approval requirements, risk managementplanning, labeling, process control validation, specification setting. All of these activities are on track, proceeding quite nicely. Soreally, no change from where we've been and the message is that process is not final until the process is final."

And the reasons for that are -- and if you're -- if you go back to theBrineura review, we were talking about where is the FDA's focus? And we had said comparability of endpoints and comparability ofpatients. And that was driven by the fact that the patients in the control setting were different patients than the patients in thetreatment setting. And those control patients were assessed using a set of tools that were developed by an academic, whereas thetools that we used were more drug industry appropriate tools -- similar conceptually, but not literally the same. In contrast, we aregenerating a roughly comparably-sized natural history data set, but in this case with 250, we're using the same tools for naturalhistory as for treatment. And now the tools will be -- the evaluations will be in the same patients before treatment and after treatment.So we think that the actual natural history database that we're building, and again, it depends on the magnitude of treatment benefit,will be actually quite robust for interpretation of treatment benefit signals."

You can probably (inaudible) in general, it's obviouslybeen relatively fertile area for drug development. However, the MPS III family of disorders has been a little bit more challengingbecause the disease is principally a brain disease or one of the most important (inaudible) are in the CNS. And given the blood-brainbarrier, it's been a difficult nut to crack. As you know, companies have tried sort of a subtler approaches like lumbar intrathecaldelivery of relatively low doses and, unfortunately, Shire abandoned a program in IIIa with that approach after having gone on aclinical hold for device-related complications. Also, as you know, Synageva, then Alexion had a program of IV delivery and had initiallydemonstrated some potential evidence of biological activity in the central nervous system after intravenous delivery. But unfortunately,at the most recent world conference, those effects just didn't appear to hold up or be real. And so I think the take-home messagesthere are: blood-brain barrier challenges are significant and not easily navigated. Now we come to more recent undertakings andanother company is taking an intravenous delivery approach using gene therapy to address the blood-brain barrier, have someinitial signals of activity and reduction in CSF GAGs. We have published that you really need to correct to normal the accumulationof the pathological species of GAGs. And it remains to be seen whether that can be achieved from the blood [side] of the blood-brainbarrier. Our strategy has been the disease, the central nervous system disease, we can make a protein to deliver it directly into thecentral nervous system, right into the -- -- where the action is in the brain. And that approach has actually proved successful already.So we like our chances. We're aware of the competition. We think there are some big challenges to the competitors, but time willtell."

And if I may, just a follow-up on the pipeline on the BMN 290 program. At the R&D Day, you guys discussed how BMN 290 isselective for HDAC-3 over 1 and 2, if we understood the data correctly. And how this could overcome some of the side effects thathave been seen with other class 1 HDAC inhibitors. So my question would be where is HDAC expressed in the body and, specifically,in the brain? And what side effects might you expect with BMN 290?"

From our preclinical studies, it appears that mild suppression appears to be the most relevantdose limiting toxicity. But we are -- or because of the design of BMN 290, we were able to achieve tissue concentrations of BMN 290,which are inducing frataxin upregulation to a substantial degree and at levels which are lower than the doses that cause mildsuppression. Now obviously, that's all preclinical work and the essential clinical question will be whether we can establish a positivetherapeutic index, that is to say, frataxin upregulation without accompanying mild suppression. We're cautiously optimistic basedon our preclinical data that we can do that, but human clinical experiments will be required to demonstrate that. Now one of theother important points to make here is that because the upregulation of frataxin is specific to the disease allele, this can only bedone in diseased patients. And the initial target population of our investigations will be patients. So we'll get an answer very quickly."

And the reimbursement for those patients is on a named patient or namedpatient-like basis, while we navigate the full reimbursement and price approval process that we have to get through in most markets.The commercial patients in Europe would be coming from each of Germany, France, Italy and the U.K. And in each of those markets,you know there's varied prescribed set of activities that sponsors need to get through to attain reimbursement approvals and a pricelevel. We are in the midst of navigating that system right now and we anticipate getting through that process in those key marketsand other markets during the course of 2018.

So payment models are a key variable for gene therapies. We're seeing how that's playing out already with the initial approvalsin the U.S. and Europe of initial products. In the United States, some of the models that have been discussed, which might includepayment over time, payment for positive results, something like a rebate for patients that don't respond adequately, those modelsare going to be challenging to implement unless they're -- until the problem of how to account for government price calculationsis solved for. There may be solutions for that, but that's a barrier to implementing those kinds of programs in the United States. Andoutside of the United States, in single-payer like models, those kind of reimbursement models are probably easier to navigate andimpossible to implement. And from BioMarin's perspective, I think, our principal interest in pricing reimbursement model is to beable to capture as much value as possible as valrox may provide: number one on a clinical value basis; number two, on a quality oflife value basis; and number three, in terms of a cost process to what is a very expensive life-long treatment regimen today. So wewant to capture as much value as possible across all 3 of those dimensions, and we are open to different reimbursement modelsthat will allow us to capture that value."

Cost structure-wise,frankly, neither vosoritide nor valrox would be materially different than what we've dealt with in the past. As you know, from amanufacturing standpoint, actually the initial commercial scaling manufacturing plant is done. We've talked about being able tohandle 2,000 to 3,000 patients a year out of that facility. There are things we could potentially do to even expand that and foradditional demand we can to construct capacity either here or elsewhere. Commercial structures would be -- and resources, wouldbe similar to what we've utilized in the past.

I would say our appetitefor large transformational deal is relatively low at this time -- that could change -- but however, we are always interested in earlierstage opportunities that would be strategically coherent with our overall strategy of continuing to develop first-in-class or best-in-classproducts for rare genetic disorders. I mean, obviously, because of the size of the company now, we are achieving $1.5 billion ofrevenues this year, I would say, unlikely we will move much or continue to -- or develop products for ultra or ultra-orphan or very,very small patient population.

So what's the trigger for usis that when we have done all the work and all the preclinical analysis that makes us comfortable that we are willing to move towardspre-IND activities and move towards initiating earlier clinical trials.

But we don't want to make the mistake that others have made by under-dosingand, therefore, giving too little efficacy. And then as far as other surrogate parameters reading on main efficacy parameters, themore important of the parameters, clearly, are the clinical efficacy parameters. We saw, in the case of Brineura, for example, quitedramatic effects on stabilization of loss of [ambulation] and progression of loss of ambulation, for example. And maybe a little lessdramatic effects on CSF brain volume. So the good news is that the clinical outcome variables were the important ones.

So as I noted earlier, I think that we -- in general, and outside of the United States, we're highly interested and motivated topursue creative strategies that allows us to capture the value that's provided by valrox. And value is typically thought of on the basisof cost offsets, but there's so much more potentially value that this program offers in terms of quality of life and better clinicaloutcomes. So we want to capture value across all 3 of those dimensions. And you're absolutely right. Pricing over time, based ondurability of effect, for example, could be an excellent vehicle for allowing us to do that. In the United States, there are some practicalimplications to Medicaid pricing reports that manufacturers must do and that needs to be solved for before some of these morecreative programs can be implemented in the United States. A potential solution would be CMS approving so-called demonstrationprojects or programs that would be submitted by a sponsor like a BioMarin. That could potentially happen. There could be legislativefixes for this on the logic that the original Medicaid legislation that put all these pricing calculations in play in the first place wasbased on a healthcare system that (inaudible) since 30 years ago, but has been overtaken by innovative advancements like genetherapy today.

Sounds good. And then another question is regarding the valrox for hemophilia A. So for the Phase III trial, will patient onlyreceive the new GMP product?"

The bulk of the trialwill include patients who are treated using that same IIB commercialized process, but manufactured in our Novato facility at the IIBcommercialized scale of manufacture. We believe that sufficient comparability of the data from the contractor to the BioMarin facilityat scale will enable us to pool the patients from smaller first part of the study to the larger second part of the study. If that turns outnot to be the case, we can simply expand the size of the larger portion of the trial for pivotal purposes."

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division",VP,False,True,"One quick question on pegvaliase. As you look towards launch and speak to payers, what are you hearing with the likely coverageguidelines for pegvaliase and how this could potentially vary by pricing. From what you've heard, are there some payers that mightrequire patient to potentially fail (inaudible) or Kuvan if pegvaliase is indeed more costly?"

So we have conducted payer research not surprisingly, in the run-up to our PDUFA date and we've gotten a mix of feedbackfrom payers. Generally speaking, I would say that the payers are comfortable with the notion of lowering phenylalanine levels as anadequate measure of managing PKU. So that's very good for pegvaliase. And payers are very comfortable, obviously, with theirreimbursement of Kuvan. So that sets a good baseline also going into the potential approval of a next-generation therapy. Beyondthat, in terms of coverage policies, we've gotten a variety of feedback, but nothing that would be suggestive of kind of hard andstrict policies across-the-board of step therapy or failures on Kuvan or that sort of thing. It's possible, but we could see some of thatcreep in initial coverage policies, however."
