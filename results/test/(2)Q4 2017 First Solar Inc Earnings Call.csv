I thought the commentary around the development project pipeline, it sounds like it's seeingsome better momentum. So do you still see the 1 gigawatt baseline being the right target for 2018 and maybe more importantlyfor 2019? Or should we be expecting some upside to that level at this point?"
2,64390726,FIRST SOLAR INC,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, FSLR",Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call,Mark R. Widmar,"First Solar, Inc.",CEO and Director,False,True,"Brian, the way I look at it, let's hold kind of the gigawatt view at this point in time. We internally are continuing to pursue allopportunities that we can at enhancing the systems pipeline whether it's development PPAs, whether it's utility-owned generation,whether it's working with large C&I customers, I'm happy with the momentum that we're seeing right now. We're also starting tosee the announcement we had with APS and the PV-plus-storage. We're seeing a lot more of that opportunity in the marketplaceright now. So I think there's a tremendous amount of momentum moving in that direction that we're very well positioned and wehave a pretty robust pipeline of projects that we're pursuing. I think we're divesting to do this right now as while we may be (inaudible)to move above that number over the horizon. I think let's stay at the 1 gigawatt, and we'll continue to update you on our progressas we move forward."

4,64390726,FIRST SOLAR INC,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, FSLR",Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call,Philip Lee,Wei Shen,"Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division",False,True,"First one here is on ASPs. We've heard some chatter that you may be trying to increase ASPs on existing bookings post 201. Yourmodule pricing is up incrementally following the tariffs. Do you have any wiggle room in your contracts to increase your ASPs foryour 7.7 gigawatts of bookings through year-end '17? Or are they locked in? And also, does your 1.3 gigs in 2018 year-to-date reflectany of the higher pricing that the market has experienced? Secondarily, we're also hearing that there may be some additional Series6 capacity coming available for customers. Is this primarily due to the additional Vietnam facility you talked about in December? Orare you contemplating yet another capacity expansion? I know you have a lot in your plate with launching 5 facilities over 3 years,but what would it take to add yet another gigawatt of capacity sometime in the next couple of years? Is that even realistic?"
5,64390726,FIRST SOLAR INC,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, FSLR",Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call,Mark R. Widmar,"First Solar, Inc.",CEO and Director,False,True,"Yes. So on the ASP, I'll start with that first, Phil. I mean, again, the way we structured our contracts, that 7.7 gigawatt that you referenced,they were firm, typically enforceable obligations between both counterparties. So those ASPs were firm fixed price ASPs in bothdirections, so there is no room to move relative to that. And we're very happy with how we contracted that volume. So it's alwaysone of those things you could look back in hindsight and say should you have done anything differently. I'm very happy with whatwe did. I think we did everything we should have and we did the right thing and best positioned us not only to best serve the needsof our customers but to enable the company and continue to grow. As it relates to the 1.3 gigawatts that we booked since thebeginning of the year, I mean, clearly, the business that has not been booked in the 1.3 is a carryforward as we started beginning ofthis year with the clarity around the 201 case. We engaged the market and we get market prices at that point in time. So is thereroom potentially around Series 6 in particular to get maybe slightly better ASPs than we would have recognized previously and thenthe 7.7 gigawatts or I guess the 2.6 that we booked to Series 6 last year? Clearly, there's always that opportunity. But it's -- again, it'sa balanced take around how we engage with our customers from that perspective. But it's always we want to make sure that we'regiving them the best quality, the best technology, enable them to be successful and to make sure we're getting the fair value forthe technology that we're providing. As it relates to the Series 6 capacity, we -- there are no firm commitment to this point in timeto do anything but what we've already indicated during our Analyst Day. Now what I will say, though, and Alex alluded to this a little     10     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

And there is some capability that potentially says thatwe could get -- if we made a decision to produce in the U.S. could we get some additional capacity between now and, say, the 2020or 20 -- beginning of 2020 time frame. Can we get a little bit more capacity? Potentially. It depends on how things play out. At thisscenario, we're going to continue to evaluate, no commitment at this point in time. But it wouldn't be in order of magnitude of 1gigawatt. We're talking a few hundred megawatts or so from that perspective. Nothing around Series 6 that would capture 1 gigawattof upside over, say, the next 2 years or so."

So regarding the revised revenue outlook for 2018, can you provide a little bit more color how muchof that was driven by the timing of the international projects versus the Section 201, the increase in Series 4 production?"

Mark, so the increase is probably about $150 million rollover from the India assets. So you're going to see a relatively small piececoming from the -- again, relatively small added capacity that we're putting on into various firms, the majority coming from therollover of those Indian assets."

Inc., Research Division",MD and Senior Analyst,False,True,Can you clarify how much of the bookings happened after the 201 decision was laid out? And then also if you could give us an updateon where we're at in terms of the historical storage solutions that you've been working on and working with partners on.

Widmar,"First Solar, Inc.",CEO and Director,False,True,"So I mean, if you think about the actual -- I guess the president made his final decision, and 201 was at the end of January. So I guessif you look at the time line, we're about a month -- less than a month I guess from when that actual final decision was made. We hada significant amount of momentum going into the bookings. Even before the announcement from -- the final decision. Now clearlythere was indication of potential impact around 201 case. Tariffs were being proposed by the commissioners to the president. Sothere has been indications in the marketplace -- stronger indications as we progress to the second half of '17 clearly. And we've --as we indicated as well, even in our mid- to late-stage pipeline, I mean, we've got over 1 gigawatt of basically negotiated volumethat sits within that pipeline just (inaudible). So what I would say is as you look at the profile of the bookings as they evolve, let's sayfrom the middle of '17 through today as well as plus what's in our mid- to late-stage pipeline as we continue to move across thatcontinuum, clearly, the indication of the overhang or the concern, I guess, maybe it's a better way to say it, of the impact of 201     11     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

But the other thing I want to make sure it's clear is we said this before. We have engaged ourcustomers and we've done this in a risk-sharing approach, and we have not tried to do anything that would be opportunistic or tocreate some form of windfall benefit to First Solar. And we look at this overall industry as having tremendous growth and potential.It is a marathon. It is not a sprint. We want to have long-term relationships with our customers. We'll treat them fairly and we'llcontinue to give them the best technology in the industry and provide the best power plant solutions and maintaining those powerplant solutions over their anticipated life cycle. So that's how we're thinking about kind of our customer engagement model andnot to try to do something that would be short-term opportunistic to adversely impact our long-term relationships."

13,64390726,FIRST SOLAR INC,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, FSLR",Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call,Mark R. Widmar,"First Solar, Inc.",CEO and Director,False,True,"I'm sorry. I think there was one other question on PVS. I'm sorry, I just want to make sure I got that one as well. Look, I think the dealthat we've done with APS, I think it's unique in the fact that -- and different than anything else that has been done so far. The PPAwith APS is for 100% of the battery components of the energy generation. It's all for power that are being delivered in the earlyevening hours. It was part of an all resource RFP, where we competed head-to-head with mainly gas figures. They were looking forgeneration that was going to be dispatched in the, call it, the 3 to 8 or even after 8:00 p.m. type of window. So we're generating thePV during the day. We're storing the energy in the batteries and then we're dispatching it at a point in time of when there's thegreatest need for that energy in the evening hours. And so that's creating a completely different value proposition and kind of ischanging the game around what are the fundamental economics of solar. It's not just looking at power generation during the middleof the day. It's saying what can we do to create -- enhance value by having truly reliable, dispatchable, controllable solar in theevening hours. So it's -- I think that more and more utilities will continue to evaluate what we've done there. I think you'll see moreand more momentum. We are continuing to see a tremendous amount of interest from our customers around thinking about storage.And whether it sits today as part of the power plant or to look at the long-term optionality around how to integrate storage at somefuture date, that creates optionality that they may want to take advantage of in the future especially in markets where the solarpenetration is much lower than it is, say, in California or even here in Arizona. But it's those types of kind of forward-looking andthought leadership kind of value propositions that we're able to create with our customers. And I think there will be a lot of interestand people wanting to learn more about what we've done with APS, and we're already getting some inquiries from customers."

So I think at the Analyst Day, you talked about 13.75 gigawatts of cumulative shipments between '18 and '20.I guess you've got 9.1 gigawatts of that booked now. Where does that go with the Ohio decision that you made? And then also Ithink it was in the -- buried in the footnotes, but can you just touch on the 700 megawatts of de-bookings that you saw during theyear?"

So right now, the way I would look at the -- if you look at the decision that we're going to continue to run 2 lines in Perrysburg,at this point in time, think of it as a commitment for this year. So there's another, call it, a couple of hundred megawatts that we     12     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

We will continue to evaluate that production aswe exit this year, do so we continue to run it into '19, do we carry it into '20? If we did it across all 3 years, then you're talking in therange of about 600 megawatts if we chose to do that. So that's -- if you think of it right now 200 megawatts, that's what we'recommitting to. We'll continue to evaluate when we make a decision to run that production longer than that. And relative to the 700of de-bookings, the largest one that we had during the year was a project which went by a couple of different names, either TribalSolar or Fort Mojave depending on -- I'm not sure exactly what we -- how we called it in our SEC filings. So that was a PPA that wehad with California utility. And because of various reasons, the viability around that project, we ended up terminating that PPA. Sothat was the picture. Then there was a handful of module agreements that we entered into, almost framework agreements that aswe looked at the viability of those framework agreements relative to incremental demand that we were seeing in the marketplacefor our Series 4 product, there was an agreement between both parties that we terminated those framework agreements. So that'sreally what makes up that -- the de-bookings that we highlighted in the footnote."

Shah,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",MD and Senior Analyst,False,True,"Mark, can you maybe talk about the margin guidance? Is it just Series 4? Or is it something else that's driving the margin outlook forthis year? And also relative to the 201 case announcement, have you seen any change in pricing for your products? Have prices gonedown or up relative to what you guys were looking at late, late last year? And then as far as the 8point3 announcement goes, youguys at the time made some comments around a challenging outlook for the utility scale power market just in terms of the fall ofpricing, et cetera. So what's your sense of how the margins in the utility scale market are looking right now relative to -- with thetime of the Analyst Day?"
19,64390726,FIRST SOLAR INC,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, FSLR",Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call,Mark R. Widmar,"First Solar, Inc.",CEO and Director,False,True,"Yes, let me -- I'll answer the 201 and then Alex can take the question on margin and 8point3. One thing that I want to go back to,the one question around the de-bookings. I want to make sure that it's clear that those de-bookings were bookings that we had onour backlog. Actually in one case, those bookings came in I think in 2015 -- the Tribal Solar I think was around 2015. The otherframework agreements were 2016, okay? They had nothing to do with any of the contracts that we have entered into in 2017. So aswe've made comments that those are firm, enforceable obligations with penalties, liquidation damages associated, these de-bookingshad nothing to do with that because I know we continue to get asked the question are these truly enforceable contracts. And I don'twant the conclusion to be it's all de-bookings. No, this is an indication those truly were not enforceable contracts. Nothing therewas de-booked. Anything to do with anything we recognized in 2017, these were all much older contracts from that standpoint. Asit relates to the 201 case, Vishal, we've -- as I tried to indicate before, we're trying to find a way that we can find a win-win for ourcustomers. We want to make sure that their projects are viable, that we're getting fair value for the technology. It also allows us tobe somewhat selective with who we choose to engage with in a highly creditworthy type of counterparties and others. So we canbe more selective from that perspective and giving the best technology that enables their business model which, obviously, enablesours as well in the other things. We're booking, as we indicated. But if you look at the mid- to late-stage pipeline, our bookings profiledips out in 2020 and really almost towards the end of 2020 and even in 2021. Those are somewhat uncharted territory for us. So forme to tell you what that pricing looks like relative to before and after the 201, it's hard for me to give you a line of sight for thatbecause that momentum has only started to happen over, I would say, the last quarter or so. So you can't really indicate movementone way or the other because we're largely sold out through '18, '19 and the first half of 2020 right now. So our bookings opportunitiesare that much further out in the horizon. What I'll tell you is that when I look at those -- on the ASPs that are out there, relative to ourroad map of Series 6 and where we're going with that technology, I'm pleased. I think it lines up with all of our expectations in thatregard. So I'll let Alex answer the other 2.     13     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

So Vishal, regarding the margins, I mean, the margin profile that we gave at our Analyst Day I think still holds. So what you'reseeing is perhaps a slight increase in margin, but this here is a function of some of the systems projects that we have. We're stillpleased where the margins are in Series 4 products, which are in line with what we guided to in December. Around 8point3 and thechallenging outlook potentially at that utility scale market, I'd say, look, as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, we ran a verycomprehensive process. Over 130 potential buyers were contacted. And while we clearly would have liked to have got to a betteroutcome in terms of price, we do believe it's the best deal out there in the market. But it's a little bit different from how we look atfuture utility scale deals. So there's a bit of a difference in that situation. At the time we were out marketing 8point3, you had -- NRGyield was also in the market, which added a little bit in terms of a less competitive situation. You'd always rather have less assetsrather than more in the market at the same time. We also had the Southern Company that owned the majority interest in a lot ofthe projects in 8point3 were out marketing a piece of their broader solar portfolio at the same time. 8point3 has minority ownershipin some of the projects, and therefore, that's different to buyer who can purchase a new project outright and have a controllinginterest. You also have a mix of utility scale as well as there's resi and C&I projects in that portfolio. The capital structure of 8point3today had non-amortizing debt, so that would have to be replaced in time in amortizing as you sold that portfolio. The asset levelstructures were already in place around the tax equities. There's less flexibility for a new buyer there, and there's also some lessflexibility of optimizing other value streams to buyers around O&M for instance."

Bradley,"First Solar, Inc.",CFO,False,True,"When I think about the result of 8point3 relative to I think about the viability of the ongoing utility scale business, I think there areclearly some differences there which give me comfort that although clearly, we preferred a higher number on 8point3 relative towhere we ended up, it doesn't give me significant doubts around our ability to successfully monetize our existing utility scale portfolioat the margins that we've guided to."

Incorporated, Research Division",Associate,False,True,"This is Tyler Frank. I was hoping you can discuss how would you think about margins over the longer term. Having -- since you havethe contracts already locked in and I assume prices, and if things go to plan with the cost road map, should we expect marginexpansion (inaudible) '19 and 2020, if that's all the information you have today?"

So there's -- Tyler, there's a lot of moving pieces in there and I'm not give you kind of a margin range. But what I'll say is look, aswe move forward, when we transition everything into Series 6 as an example, we've eliminated the form factor delta and the higherBoS cost, right? So now we've got a product that is a form factor equivalent and BoS neutral, right, potentially advantaged dependingon the application and with an energy yield advantage. So that creates a tremendously competitive product that as we move from4 into 6 would give us opportunity to see gross margin expansion. There's no doubt about that. In terms of what does that profilelook like, there's still way too many to moving pieces at this point in time to represent that. But the other thing I want to make sure,and we've highlighted this in the Analyst Day is the -- if you're talking gross margin versus op margin, I think op margin. And if wecan manage to scale against our fixed cost structure, we're going to see very strong contribution margin leveraged against a fixedcost structure through OpEx that's going to drive op margin expansion. So growth and scale will be more impactful as it relates to     14     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.
