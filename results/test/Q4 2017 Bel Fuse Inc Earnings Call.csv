3,64388616,BEL FUSE INC.,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, BELFA",Q4 2017 Bel Fuse Inc Earnings Call,Daniel Bernstein,Bel Fuse Inc.,"President, CEO & Director",False,True,"Thank you, Lynn. Before going through the financials, I want to provide a brief update on how the businesses did from the operation standpointthis quarter and what we see going forward.     Sales during the fourth quarter were $119.9 million, up 1.2% from the fourth quarter of 2016, led by sales growth within our Connectivity Solutionsgroup of 8.1%. This was partially offset by the decline in sales at our Magnetic Solutions products of 1% and our Power Solutions and Protectiongroup of 3.3%.     While sales increased during the fourth quarter over last year, our bottom line was unfavorably impacted by the following items: an $18 millionincrease to our TARP provision related to the new tax reform; $1 million of incremental interest expense related to the acceleration of deferredfinance costs at our prior credit facility in connection with our refinancing; inventory-relating charges totaling $2 million, which had 170 basispoints impact on our gross margins for the quarter; and a $1.1 million increase in consulting fees related to our ERP implementation. As many ofthese items are not expected to reoccur in 2018, we anticipate improved profitability going forward.     Looking at the full year, we are pleased that 2 of the 3 product groups showed year-over-year sales increase from 2016. Our Magnetic Solutionsgroup closed the year with $5.8 million increase in sales over 2016 levels, largely due to our new product introduction with our ICM and SignalTransformer product lines. We have been expanding the presence of our magnetic products through our distributor channels, which also continueto grow year-over-year sales growth.     Our Connectivity Solutions group had year-over-year sales growth of $1.5 million. Our Cinch business increased revenue by $7.1 million comparedto 2016, led by a strong demand for our active optical products using flight-grade, high-speed communications and encrypted (inaudible). Thetop line growth in Cinch was also aided by more breadth and depth of our products going through distribution channels throughout the year.These gains on Cinch side were largely offset by a $5.6 million decline in sales within our Stewart Connector business due to customer consolidationin late 2016. There has been renewed focus on repositioning the Stewart's business, which has led to a $1.5 million or 43% increase in Stewartbacklog since 2016.     Our Power Solutions and Protection group had yet another challenging year in 2017, with a $15.8 million decline in sales in 2016. Much of thatdecrease related due to a $10.1 million drop in sales from our NPS product line, which previously divested. Sales of our upfront -- front-end board-- I'm sorry. Sales of our front-end and board-mounted power products declined further in 2017 as large OEM customers continue to have lowerdemand for their hardware products. These declines were offset by growth within our Power Europe Group in Italy, which generated $3.1 millionof higher sales related to marine and broadcast applications.     Our circuit protection business has also experienced much success in 2017 with better utilization of our distribution channels yielding of $1.2million or 11% increase in circuit protection sales compared to 2016. Although our 2017 sales were not very impressive from the overall PowerSolutions and Protection group, we did see a turning point in the fourth quarter as that was the first quarter since 2014 acquisition of PowerSolutions business, where we saw a year-over-year growth excluding the effects of the NPS divestiture.     On a regional basis, in Europe, increased sales by $3.2 million or 4.2% increase in 2017 as compared to 2016. Sales in North America decreased by$10.9 million or 4.3%. And sales in Asia were lower by $770,000 or a 5% decrease.     On a consolidated basis, the company's backlog has increased to $146.5 million at December 31, 2017, which represents a $33 million increase ora 29% increase from its level at December 2016. While we're unable to predict the effect that this increase will ultimately have on 2018 sales, it's agood parameter we're well positioned for organic growth in the future periods over the next 4 quarters.     At this point, I'd like to turn over the call to Craig.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

4,64388616,BEL FUSE INC.,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, BELFA",Q4 2017 Bel Fuse Inc Earnings Call,Craig Brosious,Bel Fuse Inc.,"VP of Finance, Treasurer & Secretary",False,True,"Thanks, Dan. As previously mentioned, sales during the fourth quarter were $119.9 million, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross profitmargin declined to 18.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with 20.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. This was largely due to $2 million ofinventory-related adjustments recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017.     Our selling, general administrative expenses were $21.2 million or 17.7% of sales as compared with $16 million or 13.5% of sales in the fourthquarter of 2016. The $5.2 million increase in SG&A costs from last year's fourth quarter resulted from several factors. Foreign currency gains of $2.7million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 did not recur during the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, there were incremental costs in thefourth quarter of 2017 related to our ERP system implementation and higher professional fees related to tax consulting and the adoption of thenew revenue recognition standard as compared to the 2016 period.     On a go-forward basis, we would expect SG&A to run between $20 million and $21 million per quarter in the near term, barring any significantfluctuations in foreign currency. As a result of these factors, we generated income from operations of $708,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 ascompared to $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.     Income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 also included $1 million gain on the sale of a property in San Diego, which had a favorableeffect on last year's operating income. Interest expense was $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up $900,000 from the same period last year.During the fourth quarter of 2017, we refinanced our credit agreement, which caused us to accelerate $1 million of amortization related to ourprior deferred financing costs. The impact of higher interest rates in 2017 was mitigated by our lower debt balance compared to 2016.     The terms under the new credit facility improved our pricing grid over the new 5-year term, which should help to offset increases in the LIBOR rate.Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a provision of 1,219% compared to a provision of 46.9% during last year's fourth quarter.The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an $18 million impact related to the U.S. tax reform recorded during the fourthquarter of 2017. This consisted of a $16 million transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings and incremental tax provision of $2 millionrelated to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets due to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate.     Based on a 2-year average of where our profits have historically been earned, we are estimating that the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rateoffset by the effects of the GILTI tax on our low tax foreign income will result in an estimated global effective tax rate of between 17% and 19% for2018.     Loss per share for the Class A common shares was $1.66 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with earnings of $0.27 per share inthe fourth quarter of 2016. Loss per share for the Class B common shares was $1.74 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared withearnings of $0.29 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.     On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes certain unusual and other nonrecurring items, EPS for Class A shares was a loss of $0.09 per share in thefourth quarter of 2017 as compared with earnings of $0.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS for Class B shares wasa loss of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with earnings of $0.33 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.     And now I'd like to go through some balance sheet and cash flow items. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2017, was $69.4million, a decrease of $4.1 million from December 31, 2016. During 2017, we made net payments of $18.8 million towards our outstanding debtbalance. We also used cash for capital expenditures of $6.4 million, dividend payments of $3.3 million and interest payments of $4.4 million.     Accounts receivables was $78.8 million at December 31, 2017, as compared with $74.4 million at December 31, 2016. Days sales outstanding was60 days at December 31, 2017. The increase in our accounts receivable balance was largely due to the higher sales volume in the fourth quarter of2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, coupled with an increase in DSO, which was primarily a function of the timing of payments fromlarger customers in our Asia segment.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters.

The increase was seen mostly in raw materials andfinished goods to accommodate the increase in bookings during 2017. Accounts payable was $47.9 million at December 31, 2017, up slightly fromDecember 31, 2016, due to the increase in raw material purchases.     Bel's total outstanding debt as of December 31, 2017, was $125 million, excluding deferred financing cost. This represents a net decrease of $18.8million from our 2016 year-end debt level. Book value per share, which is calculated as stockholders' equity divided by our combined A and Bclasses of stock, outstanding was $13.13 per share at December 31, 2017, as compared to $13.17 per share at December 31, 2016.     And now I'd like to turn the call back to Dan and open it for questions."

There was -- one was related to the valuation of some inventory, where we had to make an adjustment to our purchaseprice variance allocation to the inventory -- between cost of sales and our inventory balance. So that was an item that kind of arose as we werereviewing the year-end balances. The other item was some inventory that we had a reserve on in prior periods. Again, expecting that we wouldbe able to do some rework on some products that whether the design -- there was an incremental design change, and we thought, we'd be ableto rework our existing inventory to satisfy the customer requirements. As time went on, the customers made some additional incremental designchanges and we made a decision at the end of the year where we felt that it was going to be too costly to rework that inventory so we basicallyreserve for the remainder of that product."

All right. That's helpful. All right. And so next question just in terms of looking at the backlog here, the first that I'd have is, can you remindus -- as I think about your backlog and try to think about where the revenue opportunity is as we all have our models, say, for '18, what do youtypically see as a split in revenues that come through a quarter? What comes out of backlog versus what's typical book and ship? Is there a way tocharacterize that for each of your segments? Don't know if it's maybe 40% out of backlog, 60% book ship, any help on that would be great."

I wouldn't say all of it turns in the following quarter, but a large majority will turnin the following quarter because our lead times tend to be a little bit shorter there. In the connectivity segment, some of our -- some of these ordersare either in our aerospace or military applications, and those tend to be longer-term in nature. So I don't really have a good handle on how muchof our Q4 backlog will actually turn in the first quarter. And the Power and Protection segment, it's kind of -- that's kind of what's in the middle. Wehave a couple of large orders that are longer term in nature, but then we also have our, let's say, recurring orders, which would, again, kind of followin the same pattern as the magnetic. So it's difficult to answer."

All right. And so last question here, and it's really kind of been the big topic for a while. It's been referenced a little bit in your preparedcomments, the Power business. What comments can you share with us in terms of understanding or thinking about or any incremental degree ofenthusiasm for finally getting a much more material uptick in that revenue generation? We've been waiting for a while as a lot that you've beendesigned into. You're getting good indicators through increases in backlog. Just trying to get a better understanding around where you folks sit?How you're thinking about this business? Do you feel you're almost out of the woods and we're going to start picking up here?"
24,64388616,BEL FUSE INC.,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, BELFA",Q4 2017 Bel Fuse Inc Earnings Call,Daniel Bernstein,Bel Fuse Inc.,"President, CEO & Director",True,False,"Yes. We thought that we're out of the woods over the last year or so. So we think we're pretty well in the bushes still to be honest. You look at ourbacklog. We do have a -- it went from, again, in 2015, if you just look at the Bel Power Solutions, which is a large part of the Power-One, it was $32.2million in 2015. Last year, it was $29.5 million. This year it's $34.4 million. So again, I think we have made some really good strides and good roads.What's really hurt us tremendously is the quality issues what we have at Facebook, where we think we addressed the issue properly and thensomething happened and we get pushed back. And you're talking about sales. That should run about $1 million a month. So we're looking at todaypossibly on that. We think it's fixed now, but we said that for other times. So I don't want to misuse it. But again, we can pick up $12 million fromFacebook get back to our normal run rate, which we think it's going to occur now in May. That definitely helps out everything we do. Again, wedo see a lot of good signs. We do see a lot of good things coming out of the data centers from doing our work at OCP. Again, but I -- until I see it,until I see consistent sales growth, I just don't want to hype it up. We are streamlining the organization a little bit more. We're taking $1 million ofcosts over the next 2 months at the group. So we know that, again, it's still a top priority of how do we turn around the top line growth."

Are you thinking about -- what kindof number? I'm assuming it's not a $12 million on top of the $39 million, but just trying to understand a little context.     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters.

So overall, I think -- and with the current backlog we have, I think we're prettyconfident that we should hit that 7.5% growth. From a gross margin standpoint, Craig, do you want to touch that?"

Hendi, we should be able to leverage that growth into some improved gross margins. Again, it kind of varies with our whatever line of businesswe're talking about. In the Mil-Aero segment, that has a little bit more leverage on gross margin than, let's say, the power protection business. But-- so I think, we would expect a 1 point, 1.5 point of margin, if we can accomplish within saying 7.5% sales growth."

And again, looking at our backlog, again, going from -- as I said, in 2015, our backlog was $126 million.2016 was $113 million. And today, our backlog is $146 million. So I think that gives me finally some good hope and hopefully some light throughthe forest now. And I think the other thing that I think is pretty exciting for us, as we mentioned in our press release, the ability to look at acquisitions,be a lot more aggressive with the acquisitions going forward with the new credit facility we have in place. So we think that's going to add a lot ofgrowth opportunities to us also."

46,64388616,BEL FUSE INC.,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, BELFA",Q4 2017 Bel Fuse Inc Earnings Call,Unidentified Analyst,NA,NA,True,False,"I'm glad to see that you have apparently turned things around and digested that Power-One, which turned out to be just a can of worms, but pailsof worms. But it does appear that you have things under control and you can now start paying down debt. I mean, this is always a debt-free companywith a lot of cash. We don't need to be that. But we're recurring a lot of debt. And I get a little nervous when I hear acquisitions because you don'tknow for sure what you're buying, and Power-One will be a strong example of that. And if you have everything turned around and we're growinginternally or not go through some time of internal growth, pay down debt a little before we start moving on more acquisitions."
47,64388616,BEL FUSE INC.,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, BELFA",Q4 2017 Bel Fuse Inc Earnings Call,Daniel Bernstein,Bel Fuse Inc.,"President, CEO & Director",True,False,"I think, [Lenny], the problem we have -- and we have a pretty active board. And one of our key board members is a person called Avi Eden fromVishay. And he was responsible being with Vishay from that growth cycle of a $60 million company up to a $2.4 billion. The problem that we facein our industry is that we've always -- our customers really are not concerned with price increases and labor whatever or what happens with coppernow or minimum material cost. They demand 2% or 3% price reductions twice a year. And the only way you really can get those costs to meetthose demands even with organic growth of 7.5%, you'll be treading water. And the only way you really can be successful is really growing the topline, knocking out, looking at acquisitions, taking out overhead and really running a lot more efficiently. I wish I could do it with organic growth.But to be honest, to see the demands that we have out there from our customers, at 7.5%, it helps, but it really doesn't get us where you have tobe. If we were having 15% to 18% growth, then I could say, hey, acquisitions wouldn't be as high as a priority as it is today. But at the current rate,I do think of that best is tread water. Hopefully that makes sense."

I think we've learned a lot of lessons. Again, we did spend a lot of money. It really was -- came down to almost, if you lookat the sales today, it was only 1x sales. So we really didn't pay a high premium for it. But from a share standpoint, the relationships we have withour customers now, what we can offer our customers and a lot of intangibles is really strengthening overall relationship with our customers. Andfrom a power standpoint, one of the things that we never realized was when you are dealing -- generally, a lot of our products are commoditized.So a lot of times when we talk to our customers, it's price, price, price. But one thing about power, it's really a engineering design product, and it'snot as price-sensitive as our other product groups are, and that's a great opportunity for us. We hope we can shine a lot better than we have in thepast. So if I -- by the way if I had to do the acquisition again, I would do it again, but probably beat up the price a lot better than I did."

You made some smart lighting and thenincreasing electronic contents for industrial and automotive. How should we view Bel Fuse's position in those growth areas?"

I mean, again, the Internet of Things, harsh environment, that's where we see a lot of growth. A lot of the things that areoutside that connect things together, we do think a lot more opportunities for the Stewart Connector product line. Automobiles, we really juststarted to scratch the surface from a circuit protection standpoint. We think there is a good growth. I think, we could do a lot better. That's one ofour key areas that we look at focusing going forward is in automobile and what goes on inside the car from electronic standpoint. However, I thinkat this point, the journey is still half. For example, Tesla was supposed doing the model 3. I think they are supposed to be building 5,000 cars amonth. And they still add 500 a month, where I think 250 going back for quality. But those are the markets we're trying to address a lot better."
