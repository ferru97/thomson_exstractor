Is there a way to parse that out if you can? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Well, what I'd say is that we've been working really hard on the commercial side of the business to really start targeting segmentsof the business that produced a higher rate per day. So we've been really zoning in on our mid-market accounts and our smallbusiness accounts to try to bring more higher-rated per-day business into the segment. You couple that with we had just a reallyrobust Thanksgiving and Christmas season. A very, very strong robust Christmas season.

I guess the follow-up is on some of the mobility initiatives and specifically Waymo, but maybe some others that youhaven't announced yet. How do you generically see that unfolding over the next several years? Is there -- is '18 a much bigger yearthan '17? Or is '19 more -- I'm just curious as to your thoughts as to how maybe your involvement evolves over time. Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Well, definitely we'll continue to expand our operations with Waymo as they continue to expand and add thousands of new cars totheir program. We are talking to other mobility solution providers as far as how we might be able to partner with them and I thinkwe'll start to see some of those unfold as well over '18 and into '19. And then I think as you look at our connected car initiative andthe opportunities to partner with people as we expand our connected car program into more fleet, it is definitely a longer-termapproach to how we can drive more efficiencies into the business and drive revenue opportunities through partnerships, throughconnectivity, as well as the service improvements that we can offer our customers as well. So I think there is a number of steps thatwill unfold over a number of years. And I think you'll continue to see us move down the mobility path each year, year-after-year, asit continues to grow as an important part of how we're going to develop our business over time."

Have you seen that momentum that you saw on the leisure side in thefourth quarter continue on? Or have you seen any sort of breakage there? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Well, we're not really commenting on what actual pricing has been going on in the quarter. What I would say is that a couple ofthings. One is that the dynamic -- the industry are what you would normally expect in the first quarter. The times of the week andthe weeks of the quarter that you would expect for the industry to be tight on fleet, the industry has been, and on the times of thequarter where you would expect it not to be, it hasn't been. The first quarter is more of a commercial quarter. There's not muchactivity other than the spring break, but they don't drive the volume of business that causes the industry to really run out of cars, aslike Thanksgiving and like Christmas does. So the first quarter is typically a more commercial quarter. So you're not going to find asmany opportunities for things like DFP to work and really be able to yield up your pricing. But what I would say is that the first quarteris not at all like we've been experiencing in the last few years. It's back to what you would normally expect first quarter fleet to bebehaving like. And with the Easter kind of the 1st of April, you might get a couple days of benefits in the end of March. But there'sjust not a lot of peak activity happening in the first quarter.     9     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

And then I wanted to ask just a little bit about fleet interest cost. I've gotten a lot of questions about how you guys maybe impacted by rising rates and the amount of maturities that you have on the fleet size coming up the next couple of years. Whenyou guys look at the pieces of debt that will fall off, say in '18 and '19, and what you might be able to replace those pieces at, howdo you see fleet interest expense trending maybe over the next 2 to 3 years given the current rate environment that we are in today?"

So I called out a likely extra cost in 2018 of about $20 million. That is simply the U.S. interest rate, or the point you'repicking up on the variable fleet debt. The Eurozone, we're expecting to be flat for 2018 and a little bit of pick up in Australia and NewZealand. But really, it's the U.S. story at the moment. And then probably 2019 onwards, further U.S. increases and then the Eurozonethen picking up. So we've got about $1.5 billion naturally coming off next year and then we're replacing. So our $20 million reflectsessentially our anticipation of those maturities come through as the renewal as well. So there will be quite an increase progressivelycoming up over the next couple of years. But it's obviously industry-wide, not just ourselves."

8,64388943,AVIS BUDGET GROUP INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, CAR",Q4 2017 Avis Budget Group Inc Earnings Call,David J. Tamberrino,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",Associate Analyst,False,True,"Larry, I'm wondering how the industry-wide fleet is in the U.S. Looking at the fourth quarter, your fleet continued to grow in thesame lines as where volume was, so utilization was flat. And I think from your comments, you planning to undergrow your expectedvolume increase for the year to drive utilization up. Curious to what you're seeing from a discipline standpoint from your majorcompetitors. Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Yes. Just first of all, about our fourth quarter fleet coming in at about flat on the utilization perspective. What really drove that -- Imean, our intent is to build a fleet to underdemand. We're going to continue to drive utilization, and we have that built into our planfor 2018. What happened really in the fourth quarter is when the hurricane -- the first hurricane hit, we actually pulled forwarddeliveries that were going to be delivered late in the quarter, beginning of the first quarter this year, to help meet that demand ofrelief work demand, plus where we just thought fleets were going to tighten up for insurance replacement business that other carrental companies might take. We pulled some fleet forward into the quarter. And when the relief business didn't materialize, or atleast didn't stay the length that we had plans for it and how it has really occurred in previous hurricanes as we discussed in the lastquarter call, we had that fleet then in the quarter earlier and longer than we had really needed it. So the team worked really hard asthey went through the rest of the quarter to try to disperse that fleet, get it on rent and to delete fleet where possible, to get ourselvesback to kind of a flat position and also to be able to ensure that we have the right fleet for the opportunities for Thanksgiving andChristmas. So they did a really good job. Looking back now would we have pulled as many cars forward as we did? No. But weexpected the relief business to be stronger and longer than it was. As far as the industry fleet levels, I would say, they were prettytypically normal. I think other people also brought fleet forward, so the hurricane does kind of throw a little bit of difficulty intolooking at the quarter. But once you get past that and you just take a look at how the rest of the quarter unfolded and how we turnedinto the year, I would say fleet levels are back to what you would consider a normal year and a normal turn into the new year.     10     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Tamberrino,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",Associate Analyst,False,True,"Okay, understood. And just a little bit in line of question earlier. I know you don't want to talk about what you're seeing so far for thefirst couple of months. But it would seem as if the fourth quarter pretty strong from a pricing perspective, but your full year evenwhen we adjust for the accounting change still implies slightly down from what the 4Q '17 levels were. Is that just an abundance ofcaution? Or is that indicative of what you're seeing so far in the first quarter understanding it's seasonably weak? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Well, I don't think you want to plan the full year pricing based on how you perform at Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we've hadsome difficult years in pricing the last few years. And so we are looking at our year-over-year trends, we're looking at how we exitedthe year. We're taking all that into consideration. As we take -- we build our volume coming from the ground up. We don't just takethe volume that we did last year and lap on an increase. We literally built it up account by account by account and our partnershipsso forth and we get to where we really think our volume is going to be. And so we -- the pricing reflects what we think will reallyhappen as we transition out of what's been a very difficult period for the last few years and some more normalized periods. And Ihope we're wrong. I hope that pricing would be even stronger than that. We do have the loyalty impact that is impacting the yearand will definitely impact more the first quarter the rest of the year. But no, I don't -- I wouldn't say it's a conservative approach. WhatI'm saying is that we just -- we need more than just at Thanksgiving and a Christmas to be more aggressive than what we're seeing."

Could you give us an update on what you're seeing in business travel and whether you believe taxreform could lead to more of a pickup? And also, could you update us on your current market share in business travel? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Well, as I said earlier, we've been working really hard on trying to grow some of the other segments in the corporate channel business.The large commercial accounts continue to be very competitive from everyone trying to win those accounts to the pricing that'soffered in those accounts. We've -- we're not losing those accounts. We're hanging onto those accounts. We're hanging on to ourshare of those accounts. So we've been really focusing more of our attention on our mid-market and small business accounts, tryingto win more of that business. It's a longer haul to do that, but if we stay focused on it as we were all last year, we'll continue to drivemore volume and commercial at a higher rate than what you're going to get with the large commercial accounts. And we're startingto see that pay off. As Martyn said, we've had kind of 2 months -- or 2 quarters in a row here where we've been able to improve --keep our pricing flat on commercial and we've seen volume growth in the fourth quarter as well, small volume uptake in the fourthquarter as well in the Commercial business. So that's far better than where we had been in the beginning part of last year and theyear before. So we're staying focused on building that, but now from a share perspective, we're holding onto our share, we're holdingonto our account and we're trying to build those other segments that come at a higher profitability."

De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Well, I think it does because I think anytime that you kind of invest in airports and create a better environment for consumers totransit to the airport to create better facilities, better traffic flows, those all help the rental car industry. So we're a big component ofthe infrastructure bill. We want to see the investments made to modernize our airports and modernize our road and I think all ofthose play well to someone that's in the mobility business like we are to have roads that are up to date and to have the latesttechnology in the airports that we serve."

I'm wondering if you could elaborate more on the International environment, what you're seeing fromcompetitors and whether you think fleet size is more rational now versus prior quarters. Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     The pricing environment internationally continues to be really tough. We're -- we've been really fighting this fight now for the lastcouple of years and it doesn't really seems to be getting -- there doesn't seem to be strategic changes in the competition that's goingto change anytime soon. That's why we're rolling out our pricing robotic and then eventually we'll get to the final phases of DFPthere as well so that it can have the benefit, our International team can have the benefit of being able to forecast further out, be ableto take advantage of more yielding opportunities, have the confidence that fleet will tighten up in periods so that they can makedecisions further out to drive more length of rental, improve their utilization. So those things are all actions that we're taking toimprove pricing from our own perspective, but the industry dynamic really aren't changing. We are seeing a growth of the third tiersegment, providers allowed people getting into kind of the lower tier offering. It really started and kind of worked to go in Spainand expanded into Italy and now starting to expand into some other countries as well. And that's something that we're going toneed to contend with as far as how we compete in that the third tier. So yes, things are -- we're managing through it. And as we said,they had a really good year last year overall. But they did -- they weren't helped by pricing. They had to do it for a lot of other hardwork, driving volume, cost cutting, being more efficient, and we would, we would really want to see pricing improve there."

Within your expectation for total RPD flat, I think it's really more like up half apoint to 2.5 points x the headwind from the accounting change you mentioned. Could you just break out your underlying assumptionsfor core time and mileage versus ancillary? And I have asked this because, last year, on a total RPD basis, it was down roughly 2 points,ancillary down I think low-single digits as well. Just what's -- what are the broad strokes or what's driving the turnaround in ancillariesbecause I know it's been under pressure in the past? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Yes. I think if you were to put our guidance in context of our old metric, it would be pretty much the same. Our ancillary revenue hasbeen under pressure. And as we've said, and we are working hard to kind of turn that around, we're pretty excited about what we'reseeing online. Our online team has been working really hard on how to present ancillary products in a more clear, concise andunderstandable way on the website so people will really clearly understand what their options are. And also in the bundling initiativethat we launched for the end of last year where we're putting products together so it makes it easier for customers to be able to clickon a bundled product. And we're seeing nice uptake on that, particularly on Avis.com. So we've got some work to do. It's more andmore people move to mobile apps and website, and we're seeing improvement in conversion of customers on our site. More andmore bookings are coming from that channel, more and more people buying -- using the prepaid option as well. We've got to findmore ways to be able to offer those products to consumers kind of no matter which device they're going to. So we've got some morework to do on the mobile app as well. We're excited by the usage of the mobile app, but we got to make sure that we can offerancillary products in a way that people can clearly take advantage of them and do it timely."

And then just one follow-up. If I take the midpoint of your guide for EBITDA price and fleet costs, it implies that while the netof your fleet cost and price should be positive, you're still guiding to margin roughly flat versus '17. I think typically what we've seenin the past is when the net of fleet cost and price is positive it implies margin expansion. So why is it that you're not looking formargin expansion in '18 despite you seem to view that the net of this variable is positive?"

I'm not sure if normal means what wesaw in the first half or the second half kind of related to that, we're seeing OEMs always talking about, again, reducing sales to othercar rental business. Does this suggests that fleets may have -- may well be tighter in 2018 than they were at least in the second halfof 2017? Yes, '17. Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Michael, this is Larry. Yes, I certainly hope so. The OEMs have been decreased -- some of the OEMs have been decreasing sales to thefleet industry. We saw that in the '18 buy, and we saw that in the '17 buy as well. When I talked about kind of back to normal, I reallymean, I refer back a few years ago prior to industry issues that some competitors had in the industry as far as over-fleeting or havingthe wrong mix, which has caused over-fleeting to occur. So we're kind of back to prior to those types of problems in the industry. Ifeel like we're kind of back to the period before that. Can they always get tighter? Sure. And I'm sure every rental car company isworking on trying to find those times when they can have their cars during the valleys as low as they possibly can and the cars duringthe peak as high as they possibly can to meet that peak. So through our fleet optimization team, through the data that we're nowbeing able to integrate into the optimization models. We're just getting more and more sophisticated about how we buy our cars,using data and third party data to help us figure out how to buy our cars, when to buy our cars, where to infleet them and where toexit them at what -- kind of what stage of their lives to really maximize residual values, you can also be able to have the cars in themarket that we need them at the time those market peak. As you can imagine, the markets we serve across the United States, that'sa very complicated model to work and our guys run these models every day, all day long, to make sure that we're constantly tweakingand changing our fleet to make sure that we try to drive that utilization benefit. We had flat utilization really for the year. And thatwas actually remarkable. When you think about us switching, transitioning in 2017 to go up 10 points in risk-cars over program car.What that means is that you have a lot fewer short-term cars that you could turn back quickly to bring your fleet levels down and tobe able to make that transition and be able to drive flat utilization when the majority -- when a much bigger part of your fleet is alonger-term fleet hold. We took a lot of effort by optimization teams and the guys in the field to really be able to deliver on that. Sowe're kind of through that end point improvement transition and risk. And now we can go into next year with, I'd say we're goinginto '18 with a risk fleet that is similar to our '17 risk fleet. And that allows us to continue to find us opportunities to try to driveutilization up and the team is very focused on that in '18."

When you talk about 0 to 2% U.S. -- Americas increase in pricing, should we look at that as similar to thefourth quarter where it was more like 5% on leisure and flat on commercial? Or do you see that mix shifting in some way? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Well, I think what you'll find is that we're continuing to shift more of our business towards leisure. It will cost more fleet speaking, ifyou will, in the third quarter and at the end of the second quarter and third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter. So that's justkind of how the business shifting. As I said, we're not losing share in the corporate business, that we are starting to see more leisurebusiness coming through. Our leisure -- in those periods, our fleets are tight, which they now have -- fleets are more normal whenthey get tight or peak periods of leisure travel, we're seeing leisure rates move up fairly significantly. I think the large commercialaccounts, as I said, will continue to be very competitive. And so I wouldn't expect big price improvement in that segment.     14     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.
