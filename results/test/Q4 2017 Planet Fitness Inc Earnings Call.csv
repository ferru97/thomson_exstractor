For the full year, we added 1.7 million net new members and finished 2017 with approximately 10.6 million members system wide. At the sametime, we expanded our footprint domestically and internationally with the opening of a company record 210 Planet Fitness locations, bringing thesystem-wide total store count to 1,518 at the end of December. With many retailers reducing their physical presence due to increasing pressurefrom online shopping, real estate trends continue to be in our favor. Landlords and developers are looking to Planet Fitness more and more as keytenants in their centers, giving us the luxury of being more selective with our site approvals.     Of the 210 stores opened in 2017, 206 were franchise locations. These were in existing markets and new markets like Hawaii and Panama. With theHawaii store marking Planet Fitness' presence in all 50 states and the Panama location demonstrating our continued international expansion. Weare pleased with the number of new member sign-ups in both Panama and Hawaii and extremely encouraged by the demand for the brand.     As important to note, more than 95% of new stores last year were opened by existing franchisees, demonstrating the attractive returns our unitsgenerate in reinforcing their commitment to growing their individual businesses and the Planet Fitness brand. While franchise growth continuesto drive our expansion strategy, we took advantage of some attractive real estate opportunities and opened 4 new corporate locations late in theyear. And then in early 2018, we acquired 6 stores in eastern Long Island, New York from a long-standing Planet Fitness franchisee that decided toretire after 11 years in the system. This acquisition made great strategic sense as the western half of the market is currently all corporate stores,giving us the opportunity to leverage our existing infrastructure and drive growth and increase margins.     Planet Fitness' long runway for growth and increasing brand awareness continues to reinforce my confidence for the future. Our marketing poweronly continues to get stronger with each new join. Starting with our growing national advertising fund, we spent approximately $34 million lastyear on national marketing campaigns and high-profile partnership opportunities like our sponsorship of Time Square's iconic New Year's Evecelebration. And we estimate that approximately $100 million was spent locally by franchisees in 2017 to highlight our unique judgment-freeenvironment that caters to casual or first-time gym goers versus avid exercisers like stereotypical gyms.     Underscoring the reach and effectiveness of our collective marketing efforts, I am pleased to report the findings of our annual brand health studyin January confirmed that brand and ad awareness levels are at their highest observed levels to date. Planet Fitness continues to rank #1 in aidedand unaided brand awareness in the gym category, both up 9 percentage points year-over-year since January 2017.     In addition, findings showed that consideration for joining Planet Fitness is higher when people are aware of our Times Square and New Year's Evepartnership, up 6 percentage points year-over-year. In addition, to being laser focused on attracting new members to our brand, we are workinghard on enhancing member experience by leveraging the data we have from our 10.6 million members, another huge competitive advantage forus given our size, scale and resources.     Looking out over the next few years, we are exploring new ways of delivering more personalized and connected fitness journey to our membersvia our equipment and enhanced mobile app. Our vision is for our equipment to have the ability to provide immersive entertainment and workoutexperiences. For example, as a Black Card member, you could have an elevated experience where you watch your Netflix, your Hulu, listen to yourSpotify, browse your Facebook or run through the Grand Canyon. Once you choose what appeals to you, you get work running on the treadmill,and your progress is tracked and sent to the Planet Fitness app. As you leave the gym that day, you see how far you ran, how many calories you'veburned and how that compares to last week, last month or last year.     Perhaps the most exciting opportunity here isn't what I just described but rather, having the ability to develop personalized recommendations onwhat workout to do during your next visit based on your history and progress. By leveraging our data, we could target White Card members andserve them trial opportunities with a goal of getting them to upgrade. And the equipment technology could allow them to easily upgrade to theBlack Card right on the machine itself, so they can have an instant access to the enhanced user experience of watching their favorite programs orrunning through exotic locations. I'm energized and excited about collaborating with our equipment vendors and franchisees to leverage our size,scale and data to enhance our members' experience in the years to come. We are currently in dialogue with 3 of our equipment manufacturersabout our next equipment contract, and we look forward to sharing more details about the next generation of machines we'll feature.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

It was extremely successful year on every front. Financially, we posted double-digit system-wide same-store sales growthfor the year and achieved record adjusted EBITDA. Strategically, we expanded our brand reach and awareness through the opening of a record210 new locations and approximately 130 million in national and local advertising. And operationally, we added some great new talent to ourexecutive team and bolstered our franchisee support teams to help further improve execution throughout the system.     We began 2018 with great momentum, and I'm confident that Planet Fitness is poised to deliver increased shareholder value over the long termand simultaneously continue to improve millions of people's lives each and every day. And underscoring their confidence in our future, the Boardof Directors recently authorized an increase in our share repurchase program to $100 million.     With that, I'll turn the call over to Dorvin."
3,64390002,PLANET FITNESS INC,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, PLNT",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,Dorvin Donald Lively,"Planet Fitness, Inc.",President & CFO,False,True,"Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing the details of our fourth quarter results, highlights from 2017 and then discussour full year 2018 outlook.     For the fourth quarter of 2017, total revenue increased 15.1% to $134 million from $116.4 million in the prior year period. Total system-widesame-store sales increased 11.6%. From a segment perspective, franchisee same-store sales increased 11.9%, and our corporate store same-storesales increased 5.6%. Over 90% of our Q4 comp increase was driven by net member growth with the balance being rate growth. The increase inpricing was driven by 90 basis points increase in our Black Card penetration to 59.8% compared with last year, combined with a $2 increase in BlackCard pricing for new joins that we've put in place system wide on October 1. During the quarter, the increased Black Card pricing drove approximately60 basis points of the increased same-store sales.     Our Franchise segment revenue was $40 million, an increase of 24.6% from $32.1 million in the prior year period. Let me break down the driversof our fastest growing revenue segment. Royalty revenue was $27.1 million, which consists of royalties on monthly membership dues and annualmembership fees. This compares to royalty revenue of $17.5 million in the same quarter of last year, an increase of 54.8%. This year-over-yearincrease had 3 drivers: First, we opened 206 new franchise stores since the fourth quarter of last year; Second, as I mentioned, our franchisee-ownedsame-store sales increased by 11.9%; and then third, a higher overall average royalty rate.     For the fourth quarter, the average royalty rate was 4.83%, up from 3.69% in the same period last year, driven by more stores at our current royaltyrate, including stores that amended their franchise agreements. As we discussed on our last call, as of the end of Q3, approximately 400 stores hadamended their existing franchise agreements to increase their existing royalty rate by an additional 1.59% and at the same time, eliminate thecommissions they paid to us on certain operational purchases, thereby reducing those operating expenses.     During Q4, approximately 500 additional stores amended their existing franchise agreements, which will further accelerate the increase in ouraverage royalty rate for 2018. However, it is important to remember that the increased royalty revenue that we'll receive due to the additional1.59% royalty rate change is being offset by a corresponding decline in commission income as we will no longer receive commission income onoperational expense purchases by these stores. I'll discuss our assumptions for future royalty rate growth later on in the call when I outline our2018 guidance.     Next, our franchise and other fees were $6.4 million, an increase of 2.5% or $100,000 over the prior year period. These fees are received fromprocessing dues to our point-of-sale system, fees from online new member sign-ups as well as fees paid to us in association with new franchiseagreements, area development agreements as well as the sale and transfer of existing agreements. As many of you are aware, there are new GAAPrules on revenue recognition for contracts with customers, which would apply to our area development agreements and franchise agreementsthat went into effect January 1, 2018. In essence, we now need to recognize these fees related to both area development agreements and franchiseagreements over the life of the related franchise agreement, typically, 10 years, versus recognizing it all at once at the time a lease is signed for afranchise store location. This not only applies to all future ADAs and FAs but also certain existing agreements entered into post TSG's acquisitionof Planet Fitness in 2012. Under the accounting rules, you cannot go back prior to our acquisition to reestablish a deferred revenue componentprior to that date. Similar to the change in royalty rate, I'll walk you through these changes and how it impacts 2018 later in the call.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Also within franchise segment revenue is our placement revenue, which was $4 million versus $3.6 million in the prior yearperiod, an increase of 11.3%. These are fees we received for placement and assembly of equipment for our franchise-owned stores. The increasewas driven primarily by higher new store equipment sales during the current year quarter.     Finally, our commission income, which are commissions from third-party preferred vendor arrangements and equipment commissions forinternational new store openings, was $2.5 million compared with $4.8 million a year ago. The decrease is attributable to the number of stores thathave amended their existing franchise agreements and increased their royalty rate instead of paying higher cost of goods per operational expensesthat I mentioned a few moments ago.     Our corporate-owned stores segment revenue increased 8.7% to $28.2 million from $26 million in the prior year period. The $2.2 million increasewas driven by the increase in corporate-owned same-store sales at 5.6% and increased annual fee revenue.     Turning to our equipment segment. Revenue increased by $7.5 million or 12.8% to $65.8 million from $58.3 million. The increase was driven byhigher new store equipment placements versus a year ago and higher replacement equipment sales to existing franchisee-owned stores.     For 2017, replacement revenue, as a percent of total equipment revenue, was approximately 38% versus 31% for the prior year. Our cost of revenue,which primarily relates to direct cost of equipment sales to new and existing franchisee-owned stores, amounted to $50.9 million compared to$45 million a year ago, an increase of 13.2%, which was driven by an increase in equipment sales during the quarter. Store operation expenses,which are associated with our corporate-owned stores, increased to $15.3 million compared to $14.4 million a year ago. The increase was primarilydriven by costs associated with the opening of 4 new stores in the quarter, including preopening expenses. Excluding these new store preopeningexpenses, adjusted store operation expenses would have increased slightly to $14.7 million from $14.4 million. We did not open any new storesin the prior year period.     SG&A for the quarter was $17.7 million compared to $13.5 million a year ago. This increase was primarily related to higher variable compensationand equity compensation as compared to the prior year. This was also the primary driver of the increase in SG&A compared to the third quarter of2017. In addition, on a year-over-year basis, we had some incremental payroll to support our growing operations and infrastructure as well as somenon-cash expenses related to the write-off of some capitalized IT cost.     Our operating income increased $17.2 million to $42.3 million for the quarter compared to operating income of $36.1 million in the prior yearperiod. While operating margins increased approximately 60 basis points to 31.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to the revenue growthand higher margins as we've continued to leverage our overall cost infrastructure. As a result of the new tax reform act, we were required to makesome adjustments to deferred tax assets and our TRA liability as of year-end, and those adjustments had to be run through our income statementand affected both our net income before taxes and our GAAP tax rates.     Our GAAP effective income tax rate for the quarter was 99.8% compared to 24.6% in the prior year period. Our 2017 results include an additionalincome tax expense of approximately $349.6 million, primarily due to the tax reform act as a result of a revaluation of our deferred tax assets toreflect the new lower corporate tax rate, partially offset by $315.6 million gain from the revaluation of our TRA liability, which is included in otherincome and expenses.     As a result of this, we reported a net loss attributable to Planet Fitness, Inc. of $3.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share on a GAAP basis for the quarterof 2017 compared to net income attributable to Planet Fitness, Inc. of $10.6 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the prior year fourth quarter. Netincome was $0.8 million compared to $21.9 million a year ago. As we've stated before, because of the income attributable to the non-controllinginterest and not taxed at the Planet Fitness, Inc. corporate level, an appropriate adjusted income tax rate for 2017 would be approximately 39.5%if all the earnings of the company were taxed at the Planet Fitness, Inc. level.     On an adjusted basis, net income was $23.5 million or $0.24 per diluted share, an increase of 19.1% compared to $19.7 million or $0.20 per dilutedshare in the prior year period. Adjusted net income has been adjusted to exclude non-recurring expenses, the impact from the tax reform adjustmentsof our deferred tax assets and liabilities, the associated TRA liabilities and reflect a normalized tax rate of 39.5%. We have provided a reconciliationof adjusted net income to GAAP net income in today's earnings release.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 688                With the passage of tax reform late last year, we now expect our normalized tax rate, which includes federal, state and local taxes, to be approximately25% to 26% for 2018. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for the impactof certain noncash and other items that are not considered in the evaluation of ongoing operating performance, increased 16% to $51.2 millionfrom $44.1 million in the prior year period. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income can also be found in the earnings release.     By segment, our franchise segment EBITDA increased 23.4% to $32 million, driven by higher royalties received from additional franchisee-ownedstores not included in the same-store sales base and an increase in franchise-owned same-store sales of 11.9%. Our franchise segment adjustedEBITDA margins increased by approximately 20 basis points to 81.1%.     Corporate-owned store segment EBITDA increased 6.5% to $11.3 million, primarily driven by a 5.6% increase in corporate same-store sales andhigher annual fees, partially offset by preopening expenses associated with the 4 corporate-owned stores that opened up during the quarter. Ourcorporate stores segment adjusted EBITDA margins increased by approximately 110 basis points to 42.6%.     Our equipment segment EBITDA was essentially flat year-over-year at $15 million. However, adjusted EBITDA increased by $1.6 million year-over-yearand adjusted EBITDA margins were 22.7% as compared to 22.9% in the prior year quarter.     Turning to the full year. Let me quickly summarize the highlights for 2017. Revenue increased 13.7%. System-wide same-store sales were up 10.2%,and this marks the 11th straight year with positive same-store sales. Our fastest growing franchise segment grew revenue by 28.9%. Our averageroyalty rate for the year increased 59 basis points to 4.25%. Corporate stores segment revenue rose $7.4 million driven by a 4.9% comp gain.Equipment segment revenue increased 6.8%, which included 193 new store equipment sales. This was towards the lower end of our range of 190to 200 due to a few franchisees that were unable to complete the construction on a couple locations in time for us to place the equipment priorto year-end. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 22.7% to $184.7 million with margins up 315 basis points to 43%. And then lastly, our adjusted netincome was up 21.8%.     Now turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $113.1 million and borrowing capacity underour revolving credit facility stood at $75 million. Total bank debt, excluding deferred financing cost, was $709.5 million at year-end, consistingsolely of our senior term loan. As you're aware from the press release we issued on January 2, 2018, we utilized approximately $29 million of ouryear ending cash to complete the 6-store acquisition from our franchisee stores located in Long Island that Chris mentioned earlier.     As we announced today, the Board of Directors has authorized an increase in our share repurchase program to $100 million. Future share purchasescould be funded by a portion of our current cash position, future cash flows or borrowings under our credit facility.     With respect to CapEx, our total spend in 2017 was $37.7 million, which included approximately $6 million for our new corporate offices. Additionally,we incurred approximately $8 million for 4 new corporate stores as well as $7 million for replacement equipment for our corporate store base. Theremaining CapEx was primarily associated with store renovations and IT projects. For 2018, we anticipate CapEx to be approximately $30 millionon an apples-to-apples basis with a target of 4 to 5 new corporate stores. We will incur CapEx for replacement equipment similar to the prior year.     Now onto our outlook. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we currently expect revenue to increase approximately 20%. However, included inthis guidance is the impact of additional revenue from the 2% of monthly dues we collect from all of our franchisees for the national ad fund,including our corporate stores and as required by the new GAAP rules beginning January 1 of this year. Prior to 2018, the NAF contributions reallyonly had an impact on our balance sheet as restricted cash or as liability. Due to the recent accounting changes, we must now recognize thesecontributions as revenue and book the expenses associated with managing the national ad fund as marketing expenses in our SG&A line. Whilewe expect there will be no impact quarterly or for the full year to our bottom line from this change, it is contributing approximately 8% to 10% toour 2018 top line growth rate.     Also incorporated in our top line outlook is the impact from the change in how we recognize ADA and FA fee revenue, which will be about a $4million headwind this year compared with 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we now need to recognize these fees over a 10-year period versus the timethe related store and lease is signed. For example, in 2017, we typically recognized $30,000 for each new store location, $10,000 for the ADA and$20,000 for the FA when the store lease is signed. In 2018, under the new rules, for each ADA and FA that we sell, we'll recognize $3,000 for the     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Helping topartially offset this headwind is the fact that we need to re-recognize the remaining portion of ADA and FA fees associated with existing agreementssigned since 2012, which were reestablished on our balance sheet as deferred revenue. We recognized approximately $6.8 million for these relatedfees in 2017 under the prior old GAAP rules. If we had been under the current 2018 GAAP rules, we would have recognized $1.2 million. In 2018,under current GAAP, we anticipate to recognize approximately $2.3 million, but as I stated earlier, approximately $4 million less than reported in2017, which under previous GAAP, would have dropped to the bottom line of our P&L.     In terms of profitability, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth to increase in the mid-teens percentage range. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPSis projected to increase by approximately 40%. This guidance assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 25% to 26%, which includes the newfederal, state and local rate following the recent tax reform. As a comparison to the prior year and before the tax reform act rate reductions, adjustednet income and adjusted EPS would have grown by approximately 20%.     We plan to reinvest a portion of our tax savings back into the business in 2018, primarily in infrastructure and technology for our stores and systemsto ensure Planet Fitness is well positioned to capitalize on the current industry trends in order to benefit our business and enhance the memberexperience. These investments, which are estimated to be in the $7 million to $8 million range, are in addition to the CapEx spend already outlined.     The following are the assumptions used in developing our full year guidance. First, with respect to sales, system-wide same-store sales are expectedto increase in the high single-digit percentage range. We were also expecting to sell and place equipment in approximately 190 to 200 new stores,again, this year and anticipate replacement equipment sales to be approximately 40% of total equipment sales. Also, I want to point out that ourEPS guidance doesn't include any potential future share repurchases.     Finally, based on the approximately 900 stores that have amended their existing franchise agreements and increased their royalty rate by 1.59%as of December 31, 2017, coupled with the new stores opening up at the current rate, we expect the average royalty rate to increase approximately125 basis points in 2018. The majority of this increase being the estimated impact of stores amending their franchise agreements with a correspondingdecrease in commission income.     I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

We had dethronedGold's Gym the first year we did that, so ever since then, we've been #1, which I think is, again, continuing to drive these comps.

The -- again, it's -- first of all say it's still really early. We just put them in fourth quarter, 15 sites, 5 of each of the 3 manufacturer sites. One,unfortunately, is yet to be put in, which will be shortly here. There's a delay in construction. It's still early, so we're cautious with that. But what I willsay and that being said is the early read on the early data is they are driving more White Card upgrades than their peers, peer clubs and driving alittle more usage than their peer clubs. So -- and evidently, people like running through New Zealand. So it's interesting to be able to -- I mean,we're doing this for 25 years, Oliver, honestly and to be able to now actually know the habits of our members and to be able to see an increase inhandful of experiences based on the -- what we've learn is just something that this industry has never seen, and we're in the forefront of figuringthat out."

So the -- when it comes to the premium consoles and all the technology side, it really comes down to that complete ecosystem, which I talkedabout in the past that we never had, neither did the industry. And I think when we work with these manufacturers of the equipment, which we'rein the process of is how do we enhance the member's experience, tee that data up back to the member so that they know what they did and howto then, with algorithms, figure out what they should do tomorrow. When you think about all the wearables and apps out there, a lot of them track.Not many recommend, and that's really the missing link, is what people need to do tomorrow to get their fitness journey started and to get results.So -- and then capturing that data, how do we use that with insurance companies and corporations to show that their employees or subscribersare getting healthier and working out and then how do we use that for advertising purposes for other businesses that say we have these members,10 million members doing over 300 million workouts a year and how do we get them, what they're doing, what they like, what they not like, whattheir experiences are and how do we get the right products in front of them based on their likes and dislikes for advertising purposes.

And then secondly, if you think about your pace of openings, is there still the idea here that you want to hold to that 200 or so becauseof what's happening on the real estate market? And is there any -- do you have any pushbacks from franchisees who want to grow faster, right,given the performance of their boxes and the brand awareness that's building, right? You would think you could go faster and pick up more share.Does the tension exist there or not really?"

And in fact, I mean, there's a number of franchisees that are ahead of their development schedule, and we'll keepbuilding in terms of site availability. I guess, I'd go back and maybe address it a little bit as we've talked about in the past and I think you alludedto is that we still see significant favorability for us on the real estate site availability front. I mean, just the latest is Toys""R""Us and others that are outthere. And we don't see that doing anything but to continue to benefit us. And given that there's not a lot of retailers, particularly with the bigREITs that are spread out geographically, there's not a lot of other retailers that are taking down, call it, a couple hundred sites. So to me, the waywe look at it is that -- I mean, we're not holding them back, and we do have sites that we will not approve for a couple reasons. One, we think thatmaybe the market is not developed to an extent that it's ready for that additional club that's going to be pulling members to that club; or second,we're -- we don't think the sites kind of Main and Main, and we want to be at Main and Main. And we believe and we're certainly seeing it that ifyou just hold on a little bit, some of those sites will become available. And then the third element, I would say, is that more and more franchiseesare doing ground-ups, and that's about an 18-month comp lag. And I mean, we have franchisees right now today that are out there doing ground-ups,and a couple of them are in the process right now. That won't open until probably early in '19 as an example. But we believe that 200 a year is,     9     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

We still think that's kind of the right number. But if we have franchisees that are bringing inmore sites in 2018 than they did in '17 and they're available sites that we think they should open, then we will approve them. But we really go atit from that angle. The last point I will make is we've had now more and more what I'd call top-down approach to whether it's Chris or myself orRob Sopkin, our Chief Development Officer, of meeting directly with REITs and then taking sites in their portfolio, one, that's either available nowor, two, that's coming up on lease expiration with the existing tenant in the next like 24 to 36 months. And we're starting to push those sites nowdown to the franchisees. We didn't do that 12, 18 months ago, and we're doing much more of that today."

And then I think the high single-digit comps guidance for the yearis a little above what you had guided to initially for last year. So could you just talk about the sustainability of what you're currently seeing?"

We think Q1 will be clearly on the high end of that. Maybe low, low double digit, but we have that much visibility intoQ1.

But no doubt with the app and the technology and be able to host what people are doing, you can see how we could easily tieachievements to some sort of rewards program or partnerships with other brands, the companies that we have partnered with or bundling. Sothat would be a case, too. So that's why we spend $7.8 million. And then I think one thing with that technology we think about is it is a -- it's notsomething that's one and done. It's an ever -- it's an evolution, and it will be as we learn and fine-tune over the years ahead of how we use it andhow we enhance member's experience.

I would say there's always outliers, John, a little bit. I mean, the extremes could be, say, a high urban area, is an example, corporate store inOakland, California over indexes in members and monthly EFT and certainly, EBITDA to more rural markets or markets outside of a metropolitanarea that might decile down a bit. We built a few more smaller stores in the last 12 months than we did the previous 12 months. And when I saysmaller, smaller on a square footage basis, not significantly but a little bit smaller. Sometimes that's because the only space you can get andsometimes it's because it's a little bit of a smaller market. But in terms of -- the way I look at it, John, is how our franchisees' portfolio doing, knowingthey're not going to hit a grand slam on every single one and knowing they might, to a certain extent, maybe do what we kind of call a fill-in toget a store into a market where you can -- you want to get one in there, maybe get it before the competition might get there. But it might be asmaller store. And it might be one that you might not even expect to be up to your kind of average. But from talking to our franchisees, looking atour corporate store portfolio, we opened 4 stores in Q4 last year, there's no major outliers out there. And with our Black Card percentage beingslightly higher with the $2 price point being higher, albeit it just started October 1 with new member sign-ups on the Black Card perspective, wecontinue to see very good profitabilities at the four-wall basis."

And certainly, a lot of systems that I covered, you have some different economic performance across geographies. I mean, it's alot of different reasons that markets can perform materially different from, if not, an average unit volume perspective but from a profitabilityperspective. Have you seen any real surprises, whether on the high side or on the low side that you're seeing as you're really -- you're kind ofcontinuing this fully national expansion?"

Many do. But whether you're in a Dallas, Chicago or Orlando, a Phoenix, a Denver, you goacross these different geographies where you might say the ethnicities in the market might be different. You might say the income levels mightbe different. The weather might be -- you can go through all those, and John, we really don't see that. Now as I said earlier, there's always outliersthat might perform a bit different but not in the kinds of percentages that ever worry us whatsoever. So what we see is that you will have somemore rural markets or smaller population markets. But then they typically have very low rents. And so you might have 10%, 15% less in membersbut you may be paying, instead of high teens or $20 square foot rent all in, you may be paying $5, $6 or $7.

Can you talk about after like having it in place for a quarter, what's your expectationgoing forward and what you're seeing in terms of the penetration?"

As I said, it was about a 60 basis point impact in Q4. It began January 1. It was for new Black Card members. We said when we did the pilot thatwe saw little to no negative impact in the acquisition side of it. So it's -- it wasn't unexpected as to how that kind of came out, but it was about 70basis points. I think that, as we look at 2018, the pricing should have probably 175, 200 basis points embedded into our guidance."

You gave us the impact that's going to have on your income statement, non-GAAP of 39.5%to maybe 25.5%. Maybe walk us through how your cash tax rate changes before and after tax reform and then the TRA impact if there is any. I knowthat's a delayed impact. Would you give us a schedule? Just curious how that schedule is going to change as a result of different tax rates. Andthen maybe talk a little bit about your franchisees, how tax reform is affecting them. I guess, I don't even know if they're mainly paying the corporaterate or if a lot of these guys are paying the pass-through rate. But ultimately, what do you expect them to do with those savings? And does any ofthat benefit you?"

So previous to the tax reform, our adjusted tax rate of, call it, 39% to 40% was based upon assuming all of our shares were Class A shares andall those shares -- so therefore, all of the income was taxed at the Planet Fitness, Inc. level. And today, we're roughly about, call it, 90%. 89%, 90%of our income is taxed at Planet Fitness, Inc. because we have about, call it, 10%, 11% of our shares are class B shares. So at a 39% to 40% tax rate,we were getting a tax deduction from the step-up basis from those stock sales, most of which were from TSG as they sold out. And we were getting     14     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

And of that $0.40 on the dollar, then which reduced our cash taxes to the government, 85% of thosesavings of that benefit went to the TRA holders, and then 15% of it stayed in the company. So the way I've always talked about it is think aboutthat our 39% tax rate was roughly because of the step-up -- we got about a 15% reduction off of that. So that was kind of the benefit to the companyby having this upstate tax structure in place. So now if you fast forward to, call it, 25%, 26% tax rate now with our Federal state and local tax ratethat we're estimating will be our full rate for 2018, now then those deductions, which that's why there was that huge deferred tax expense, whichI talked about that went through our P&L, is that we, in essence, then we remeasured that future benefit because it's no longer worth $0.40 on thedollar. It's only worth, call it, $0.25 on the dollar. But we'll be paying a lower cash tax rate using that 25%, 26%. So the way to think about it then isbecause that we will -- with the taxable income we have, albeit reduced by this tax basis deduction that we get at a 25% rate, we'll pay significantlyless in cash taxes to the IRS. But we'll still pay 85% of those savings at that 25% tax rate. We'll pay those to the TRA holders. So again, it's about a15% benefit to Planet Fitness, Inc. off of that 25% to 26% tax rate. So let me pause there and see if that is clear in the way that the -- kind of, inessence, cash taxes and the adjusted tax rates as I just walked through, if that makes sense."

But I guess bottom line it for me. From a free cash flow -- after-tax free cash flow, how is that being affected by the new rates?"
56,64390002,PLANET FITNESS INC,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, PLNT",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,Dorvin Donald Lively,"Planet Fitness, Inc.",President & CFO,True,False,"Yes. So if you look at our free cash flow, what you still have to look at is the TRA payment because it's not in your P&L because you're only taxed at,call it, a 25% tax rate on lower income because of the tax deduction. But you'll go to the cash flow statement, and you'll see a payment that goesto the TRA holders, albeit in the following year. So for example, in 2018, when we take a tax deduction that's only worth $0.25 on the dollar, I'llreduce my taxes that I pay throughout this year because you have to make quarterly payments. I'll pay less taxes to the IRS, so less cash taxes, andthen in 2019, I'll pay 85% of those savings out to the TRA holders. But that will go through the cash flow statement, and so you'll need to look, inessence, at free cash flow less the taxes paid under the tax benefit arrangement, i.e., the TRA."

I think a couple things is -- and obviously, we'll get this on a corporate basis as well, where capital assets outside of leaseholds, you'll get a100% deduction if they are placed in service. And so we'll get that as a corporate entity. And then a franchisee, whether they're a LLC entity or acorporate entity, will get immediate deduction of their CapEx assets less leaseholds. And then in addition, there's about 20% of their income thatis, if they're an LLC entity, that gets passed through at a 0 tax rate, subject to a limitation that's 50% of their W-2 wages. So the idea there, if you go     15     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

In essence, that's what, I believe, they're doing by this immediate write-off of an asset. But they're saying that you -- what you got to do is yougot to be employing people. So if you employ people, you're paying them wages. So we're going to give you a 0 tax on 20% of your income butonly if you have W-2 wages. And so they put that limitation of 50% of your W-2 wages in there. So that's -- I don't know what percentage of thesedid, James, have LLCs. I'd say a fairly high percentage do, particularly the smaller guys. So I think the net of it is there is going to be incentive tobuild stores. There's going to be incentive to replace equipment with the stores that are coming up to -- that need to have their reequips done,and they'll be able to save taxes at the end of the day by doing so. So I -- net-net to our business from a franchisee perspective, I think it's positive,win-win."
