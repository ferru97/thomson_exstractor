2,64390109,BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, BKD",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lee S. Wielansky,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,Independent Director,False,True,"Good morning to all our shareholders, analysts and other participants, and welcome to the Brookdale's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 EarningsCall. As you are most likely aware by now, we made several significant announcements this morning, regarding a turnaround of Brookdale. I willdiscuss the details of the strategic review and leadership changes and then turn the call over to Cindy to describe our path forward. As we announcedthis morning, we have formally ended our strategic review, and as we promised in previous earnings calls, I will give you insights into the process.We announced to kick off our strategic review in February 2017. The board and management, assisted by our legal and financial advisers, exploredmultiple options and alternatives to create and enhance shareholder value. Throughout this process, we stated that Brookdale would enter into atransaction only under terms that our board concluded will be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. It was a long and robustprocess. We received interest from numerous potential counterparties. We reviewed a number of proposals, and we had in-depth discussions withmultiple foreign and domestic parties regarding various strategic alternatives, including but not limited to the sale of the company. We wentthrough multiple iterations and negotiations with several of these counterparties.     As we noted before, the process was complicated by the need to incorporate certain third-party consents, and we were conducting parallelnegotiations to seek those consents throughout the process. An important outcome of the strategic review process was the HCP transaction thatwe announced in the fourth quarter 2017. This improved the change of control provisions in some of our lease agreements and provides thecompany with more transactional flexibility.     At the end of the strategic review, the board ultimately rejected an indication of interest to acquire the company for $9 per share in cash, whichpurported to range up to $11 per share in cash subject to conditions that the board did not believe were likely to be satisfied. The board did notbelieve this offer was acceptable and believes that company can ultimately create more value for shareholders by driving higher performance asa public company under new leadership. The board also believes the rejected offer and our current share price was significantly below the company'sintrinsic value and below our net asset value. Prior to receiving and rejecting the final indication of interest, we had other interest at higher pricesand we've pursued each vigorously. However, for a variety of reasons, including the necessary consents that would have enabled us to transact,none resulted in firm offers. As we disclosed in today's press release, we have now concluded our strategic review. Although the formal processhas concluded, as always, we are committed to evaluating all opportunities to enhance shareholder value and we'll continue to do so.     Now let me comment on the leadership changes we announced this morning. Andy Smith will step down as President, CEO and Board member. Iwant to personally thank Andy for his contributions to Brookdale for over a decade. Dan Decker has also fulfilled his commitment to lead Brookdaleas it determined the best path forward. Now that we have set our course, Dan has completed that commitment and has chosen to retire from theboard effective March 1, 2018. Bill Petty has also retired from the board. I worked closely with Dan and Bill, and on behalf of the board, want toexpress our appreciation for their leadership.     Let me now announce our -- let me now address our announcement that Cindy Baier will become President, CEO and board member. Many of youknow Cindy as our CFO since joining Brookdale in 2015. She has built a high-performing finance function and led the following initiatives: improvingBrookdale's liquidity, rationalizing our corporate overhead structure, improving the quality and lowering the cost of support services provided toour residents and communities and improving our visibility into the key drivers of business success. When Cindy joined Brookdale, we knew shewas a proven, change-oriented executive who has demonstrated her abilities across multiple industries and leadership roles. Beyond the breadthof her current and prior company's CFO roles, Cindy has had multi-billion-dollar P&L responsibility, has served as an executive officer, reporting tothe Chairman of a Fortune 30 company, was a CEO for a publicly traded retailer and has served for more than a decade as a board member of publicand private companies. The board has full confidence in Cindy. Over the past months, we've tasked her with additional responsibilities, includingto begin formulating a turnaround strategy. She has been working directly with our operational sales, marketing and other leadership teams toplan and begin implementing tactics to improve our results. I look forward to working with Cindy, as the company create shareholder value byimproving our execution, taking additional actions to return to growth and increase margins as the industry rebounds over time.     Cindy, I'll turn the call over to you now.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

3,64390109,BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, BKD",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,CFO,False,True,"Thank you, Lee. Let me add my good wishes to Andy, Dan, Bill and Bryan Richardson, who is also leaving the company. On behalf of the leadershipteam and our associates, I want to thank them for their years of service to Brookdale. I'm honored to take on this new role, and I'm excited by theopportunity. Although Brookdale has underperformed, we have a strong foundation and tens of thousands associates who are committed to ourmission and to the residents we serve. I look forward, with the help of the company's associates, to restore the company to our previous successby shifting our focus to winning locally, while leveraging our industry-leading scale. With the changes that I will describe today, we intend to driveattractive, long-term return for our shareholders. In the past few months, by working shoulder to shoulder with the key operational leaders, wehave analyzed our operations to determine what is working and what is not. We developed a concrete plan to focus on the key value drivers ofour business model to improve the performance of the company. We will measure our progress against preestablished metrics. We will be intentionalabout what we're going to focus on. We have a robust road map to achieve Brookdale's long-term growth potential. I'll share the details with youshortly. At the same time, we know that our real estate philosophy is a critical value driver. Our goal is to optimize our portfolio, while opportunisticallycreating value from owned real estate.     Let me review our history and highlight the decisions that we've made about real estate. After integrating Emeritus communities in 2015, weundertook a comprehensive review of our portfolio. In 2016, we began our portfolio optimization initiatives. Since then, we have sold or terminatedleases for 165 communities. These have typically been challenged assets in declining markets or community in need of significant resources. Thiswas a step towards simplifying our operations. However, the net financial impact to shareholders was not significant.     During the strategic review process, we identified assets we can monetize, including several high-end communities, by taking advantage of themarket where stable assets are in high demand and can command high multiples. This may include some of our highest performing communities,where we don't see the same future growth potential as we see in other parts of our portfolio. We also expect to continue pruning disadvantagedassets from our portfolio.     In 2018, we expect to market and sell approximately 30 communities, in addition to the asset dispositions we have announced previously. This islikely to generate proceeds in excess of $250 million, net of associated debt and transaction costs. In the coming quarter, we will assess our capitalallocation strategy for these proceeds. We will continue to look for opportunities to create value from our real estate, while we pursue our turnaroundplan to improve our operating performance and financial results.     Let me turn to the operations next. Our operating focus will be based on 3 tenets: first, attract, engage, develop and retain the best associates.Second, our resident and family trust and endorsement by providing valued, high-quality care and personalized service, which in turn leaves us toour third tenet, which is to drive attractive long-term returns for our shareholders. We plan to return to our strong foundation, while we willdifferentiate ourselves based on caring associates who create passionate advocates and generate referrals. It's about winning locally while leveragingour industry-leading scale and experience.     On the surface, you may not see this as a big change from what we said in the past, but the reality is, our focus is very different. We will makedecisions closer to our customers by empowering our executive directors with more local decision rights. We are also changing how we allocateour resources. This is about improving our ability to operate by narrowing our focus. You can't be the best of anything when you're trying to doeverything. But we will stop trying to do so much and we will eliminate anything that distracts us from our mission. We will make sure that ourassociates are able to focus only on what matters most, our residents.     I'm excited to share a few comments about the 3 pillars of our path forward: associates, residents and shareholders. First, we will invest appropriatelyin our associates. We are on the right track with our initiatives around key leadership. In 2017, we took the first step to invest more in the top rolesin our communities. We made good progress with our efforts to improve the retention of our executive directors and our health and wellnessdirectors. Because of this success, we are expanding this program deeper in our community organization. And it's more than just increasingcompensation. For example, we are improving how we recruit and onboard our new associates into their role. This is already begun to favorablyimpact turnover by reducing churns in the first year. We will ensure that our associates' interests are closely aligned with the work they do. Thatthey know that the work they do is meaningful and that they receive the proper rewards for their efforts. At the same time, we will invest intechnology to remove routine tasks so the associate can center their attention on the work they enjoy most, taking care of our residents. By buildinga workforce that is valued and supported, we can better attract, retain and develop an excellent team.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Our unwavering commitment is to our customers. We will continue ourwork on enhancing our customer value proposition, differentiating based on quality, choice, personalized services and associates who care. Wewill raise Brookdale's profile on a local level with potential customers and their adult children. We will concentrate on customer satisfaction becausewe know through improving Net Promoter Score, work that delighted our residents, correlates with higher performance. We've identified the needto change our sales and marketing national versus local mix and intend to implement other changes we've identified to improve our performance.For example, we have initiatives to improve our lead management, pursuing the most productive channels, improving our initial response andfollow up on those leads and marketing in a local targeted manner. At the same time, we are discontinuing well-meaning initiatives that distractfrom the things that matter most.     Third, and finally, from the operational standpoint, we will continue to optimize our business model to strengthen our financial proposition. Wewill execute on our new real estate initiatives that I outlined earlier. Over the past several years, we have taken incremental steps with divestituresand G&A cuts. We are committed taking additional actions to return this company to the great leadership position that it had in the past.     This week, we are implementing additional G&A cuts. This includes eliminating projects outside of our key focus areas, consolidating our operatingdivisions and flattening the organization in order to get better economies of scale in our back office. In total, we are targeting $25 million of G&Asavings, before normal cost inflation and normalized bonuses. These cuts are meaningful to cash flow. We are continuing to assess our operatingexpenses to ensure that the costs are supporting our most important initiatives. We are cutting costs in order to invest in the areas that we believewill have a lasting, positive impact on our competitive positioning.     I would like to close my remarks with a few comments about what we experienced in 2017 and what we expect to see in 2018. 2017 was a difficultyear. We experienced competitive new openings across many of our markets, and our teams were proactive with actions regarding marketing,pricing and capital expenditures to meet those pressures. Our occupancies seasonally declined in the first half, exacerbated by a flu season thatextended into the second quarter. During the second half of the year, we improved occupancy and achieved a positive rate growth, though subduedas we fought for market share. Our labor cost increased during the year, due to both the competition for new associates and our intentionalinvestments to improve retention. Our portfolio optimization reduced revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the short run, while shedding owned andleased assets that we did not feel strengthened our platform in the long term. We responded well to significant natural disasters in Florida, Texasand California to protect our residents and patients, but these events did have a financial impact on us. The growth of our key metrics was alsoimpacted by the positive reserve adjustments made in 2016 that did not recur in 2017. During 2017, we made good progress with our balancesheet. We built a significant amount of liquidity and refinanced on major 2018 mortgage debt maturities. Taking the cash on hand to pay off theconvert in 2018 into account, we have a very reasonable debt maturities over the next 5 years. As of year-end 2017, we have $873 million liquidity,including $515 million of cash and marketable securities and $358 million of availability on our line of credit.     Looking quickly at our quarterly results, we were pleased with our fourth quarter 2017 business performance. There was really no change in themacro environment from the prior quarter, with elevated competition and material labor cost pressures.     Our occupancy performance for the fourth quarter was good -- for fourth quarter, producing a 40 basis point sequential increase. This was in spiteof a difficult December, which experienced an adverse weather impact and a flu season that was more severe than normal and, which started earlierthan usual.     Our aggregate rate growth remains steady even as we built occupancy. We remain proactive with our pricing actions and saw a negativemark-to-market on new move-ins, which went from minus 6% to minus 3% in the fourth quarter. On the expense side, our labor costs continue toincrease, due to tightness in the labor market, wage inflations and company initiated investments, as I mentioned before.     In the fourth quarter, we continue to see specific, positive impact of our initiatives to improve our operating performance. For example, we sawvoluntary turnover of our top 3 community leader positions declined 19% year-over-year in our consolidated portfolio for both the quarter andthe full year.     Let's turn to 2018. As we look at 2018, our senior housing business is in the midst of a perfect storm of heavy pressure from new supply, wagepressure from a tight labor market, the constant pressure of lease escalators and the relatively recent pressure of rising interest rates. We expect     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

We do expect,based on the strategy described earlier and the investments we're making, that we will begin to demonstrate improvement as we prepare to returnto year-over-year growth in 2019. With my appointment as CEO this week, I will take the time to continue to study the business in a thoughtfulmanner, to meet with our REIT and other key partners and to further refine our near-term plan before issuing formal guidance for 2018. However,I will provide some color about 2018. Year-over-year comparisons will continue to be negatively impacted by the impact of our announceddispositions either due to the full year effect of 2017 closed transactions or those that we close in 2018. However, these real estate initiatives willposition us for creating long-term shareholder value. Slide 21 in our current investor presentation, which is on our website, is helpful to understandthe impacts of our portfolio optimization initiative. This slide is a pro forma of our 2017 result, after reflecting the impact of transactions that arecomplete or in process, but does not include the approximately 30 additional asset sales that we announced today. While some of these transactionswill only be reflected for part of 2018, this slide will help you understand the results of our continuing operation. There is no doubt that 2018 willbe challenging, but with the operational changes and investments we're making coupled with a focus on execution, I am confident we will beginthe process of improving our results and performance and position Brookdale for future growth and success. Our strategy is built on growing thetop line, in spite of the challenges we face in our market. We expect same-store occupancy to be slightly down for the full year. It's important tonote that our portfolio differs from the REIT because we are starting from a lower occupancy base and we have more communities in secondarymarkets, where we project fewer openings in 2018 than primary markets. It's also important to note that because our occupancy declined during2017, we have to recapture the occupancy loss during 2017, before we can grow in 2018. We do expect our occupancy to be impacted by the fluseason. Based on what we know today, this is the worst flu season in 20 years as it relates to seniors. Our first obligation is to protect the seniorswe serve and so as a result, we have closed our communities to new admissions for over 1,000 days in the first 45 days of the quarter. This comparesto closing our communities for 800 days during the entire first quarter of last year. When our communities are closed, we can't conduct tours ormove new residents in, which has an adverse impact on occupancy. At the same time, we are seeing an elevated death rate. We expect same-storetotal labor costs, including benefit, to continue to grow beyond customary inflationary increases. In 2018, we expect a 5.5% to 6% increase on ayear-over-year basis as we invest deeper into the organization to improve retention that creates growth. Finally, we expect to somewhat reduceper-unit spend on capital expenditures, but remain committed to spend appropriately to support the business.     So as I wrap up these prepared remarks, let me be clear. 2018 will be a very tough year. The changes I outlined will be painful, but necessary. Andwe will adapt as we learn. We need to fix and invest in operations to get back on the right long-term path. While those investments will impactyear-over-year comparisons, it will ultimately lead to higher occupancy, stronger rate growth and greater, more sustainable adjusted EBITDA andcash flow.     Finally, I want to close by saying that I believe strongly in the growth opportunities for Brookdale. In late 2017, we started to demonstrate progressin key areas. Continuing the momentum will allow us to overcome the near-term headwinds and lay the foundation for success. In the future, thedemographics will become a tremendous tailwind for the industry. Health care spending continues to increase as the population ages and seniorhousing will play an important part in caring for this country's seniors. Our readers are working diligently to execute our new strategies to driveimproved operating performance and create shareholder value.     I'm happy to answer your questions now."

So I guess, on that front, so you said it -- you plan to increase the Program Max because that's where you see the highest returns. So whatare the some of the examples of projects that you mentioned that you will try to, I guess, walk away from, so to speak, or refocus this spending. Sois it the cap exposure? Or is it something also that's could on the operating expenses? So any kind of examples you can give us in terms of thingsyou -- as of now, you decided to kind of reduce exposure because what I'm getting at is, is there something where you kind of considering maybereducing your Ancillary Services business at all?"
19,64390109,BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, BKD",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,CFO,True,False,"So let me take that question. I think there are a few questions in there. So first with regard to CapEx, we are not reducing the number of CapExprojects we have by any mean. In fact, with Program Max, we're increasing the number of projects that we have underway, but as you think aboutthe impact of projects on the community, our objective is to reduce well-meaning initiatives that are impacting our communities. So if you thinkabout it, there has been numerous, numerous department-driven pilot projects that consume the time of our community leaders. We have andwill continue to eliminate many of these. Regarding streamlining, one example that we significantly abbreviated was a 600-item questionnairethat previously each community had to complete. We're also improving our decision rights. And so one of the focus areas that we have is we wantour decisions to be as close to the customer as they can be. So we're empowering our executive directors and that's something that's a pretty bigfocus for us. With regard to our Ancillary Services business, we think that's a critical part of our business and we think that it provides a differentiationfor our customers as they're able to get additional care within the same company.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

21,64390109,BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, BKD",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Chad Christopher Vanacore,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",Analyst,True,False,"So Cindy, you mentioned occupancy, you're in a difficult December, but also we look at occupancy, it had been up 40 basis points sequentially inthe fourth quarter. So how did that occupancy trend by month?"
22,64390109,BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, BKD",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,CFO,True,False,"So we were up in October and November and then we were down in December. Now in December, there are 2 things that were challenges for us:the first was it was an unseasonably harsh weather pattern and the second was that the flu season started much earlier this year than it normallydoes. Normally, we don't see a flu impact until the first quarter, but we did see the flu hit our communities in Q4, particularly in Northeast. Now asI've mentioned, when there is flu in a community, we basically close the community. And we do that to protect our residents. We also do that tomake sure that we're protecting everyone. So when that happened, we can't give tours, we can't move new residents in and so because of thatyou have an impact on occupancy."

And it seems like that occupancy is bleeding into the fourth quarter, and you had mentioned that the flu had really closed to -- down forabout 1,000 days in that first 45 days in a month. So how has -- how's that occupancy trended in January? Can you put a number to it?"
24,64390109,BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, BKD",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,CFO,True,False,"I won't put a number to it, but what I will say is that in Q1, we normally experienced a seasonal decline. So Q1 is always, almost always lower thansort of Q4 and 2018 is no different than that. As you did mention, we are having a flu impact. It's the worst flu season for seniors as it's been in 20years. And so that has an effect not only on our move-ins, but also in having an increased death rate."

26,64390109,BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, BKD",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,CFO,True,False,"It's too soon to say. As far as we know, the flu impact hasn't peaked yet. It normally peaks about this time, but we're still seeing pretty elevatedpath. When we get together on our next call, we'll be able to provide additional clarity on that for you."

Well, I guess, I will change gears a little bit. And then just thinking about the strategic review process, what were some of the terms in thatindicated offer that you mentioned that the board felt was unachievable or untenable?"

And I will say that we've already taken a large numberof the actions this week, in fact. Just to remind our G&A. Now a quick reminder, the $25 million is before normal cost inflation and before normalizedbonuses. Because we underperformed last year, we paid much lower than normal bonuses and our expectation is that we will perform in 2018 andso we will pay normalized bonuses."
