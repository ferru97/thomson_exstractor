2,64389261,SANGAMO THERAPEUTICS INC,02/22/2018," 1:00PM, SGMO",Q4 2017 Sangamo Therapeutics Inc Earnings Call,Alexander D. Macrae,"Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.","President, CEO & Director",False,True,"Thank you, McDavid, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to announce today that Sangamo and Kite, a Gilead company, have enteredinto a collaboration to develop gene-edited cell therapy products for oncology.     Next-generation autologous and allogeneic CAR T and T-cell receptor therapies require precise, efficient and specific genome editing. Kite isinvesting heavily to win in this emerging field, and we're thrilled to be their chosen partner supplying gene-editing technology for the developmentsof new CAR-T and T-cell receptor treatments for patients with cancer.     In a few moments, Curt will provide more details of this agreement and what it will mean for the evolution of Sangamo's business strategy. Butfirst, I want to reflect on how the development of the technology has enabled this collaboration.     Our zinc finger engineering capabilities have advanced rapidly in the last few years with improved zinc finger nuclease architectures. Novelenhancements have resulted in a 300-fold increase in potential design options for a given genetic sequence, yielding higher, on-target modificationactivity with ex vivo editing efficiencies now reaching as high as 99.5%, an off-target cleavage consistently below the level of detection.     We have also made great strides towards industrializing production of ZFNs, which helps expedite our research and meets the needs of partners.The adjacencies of computing and sequencing technology enable rapid screening and the development of lead candidates. It takes us 10 days, 8,if we work through the weekend, to produce a 96-well plate of options that can be further tuned to increase efficiency and remove nonspecificbinding contacts to reduce off-target cleavage to undetectable levels. We are combining these advancements in our technology with our experiencespanning 2 decades in preclinical and clinical research in this field.     To my delight, soon after joining Sangamo nearly 20 months ago, I learned that the science here is even better than I expected. It has remarkabletechnology. And it's second standard for what therapeutic genome editing should be, precise, efficient, specific. We are delighted that when Kitecame looking for an editing partner, they chose Sangamo and that they chose zinc fingers. And we are equally pleased to our search for an optimalcollaborator in oncology has brought us to Kite because we sought a partner with the financial strength and clear determination to win. No othercompany is investing as heavily to bring the new products forward. This collaboration fits very nicely with our strategy to partner technology forapplications that require special expertise or resources.     Oncology is an incredibly competitive therapeutic area, and genome editing is just one of the several important inputs into these new cellulartherapies. We believe the dedication of Kite to this space greatly increases the probability of success for the development, commercialization ofzinc finger nucleases across a range of products in oncology.     This announcement builds on the momentum of last year, in which we made significant progress, transitioning Sangamo from its previous researchfocus to a sustainable, fully-integrated company that aims to translate cutting-edge science into genomic medicines to transform patients' lives.     With new management, a clear strategy, the validation of multiple external collaborations, a strengthened balance sheet and with core values thatmake our patients a central focus of everything we do, Sangamo is now operating with an urgency and efficiency to pursue the vast opportunitiespresented by our technology platform.     2017 was foundational. 2018 promises to be transformative. We now have 5 active clinical programs across our gene therapy, genome editing andcell therapy platforms, and expect to see progress in patient enrollment across all our studies, and most importantly, efficacy data begin to readout throughout the year. We recently provided a safety data updates from our MPS II clinical study at the 2018 World Symposium Congress andexpect preliminary efficacy data readouts from our MPS and hemophilia A clinical trials towards the first half of this year.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Heather has deep biotech experience, having worked at Cooley, and also as an in-house general counsel for the last 15 years. She will help ustremendously, as we advance to the late-stage development and on to commercialization.     And as we establish our footprint in Europe and plan the strategic expansion of clinical development and other operations abroad, Duncan's roleis critical to execution of our 2018 goals. He's already begun planning for our clinical operations in the U.K., and we're working closely with Ed onEuropean clinical trial initiation for MPS and hemophilia B. I've known Duncan for more than 20 years and worked with him closely during muchof that time. He knows the industry well and is someone who just gets things done.     I'll now turn the call over to Curt, who will discuss in greater detail our newly announced oncology collaboration with Kite and provide an overviewof our evolving business strategy for 2018. Curt?"
3,64389261,SANGAMO THERAPEUTICS INC,02/22/2018," 1:00PM, SGMO",Q4 2017 Sangamo Therapeutics Inc Earnings Call,Curt A. Herberts,"Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.",Senior VP & Chief Business Officer,False,True,"Thanks, Sandy, and good morning, everyone. We are excited to announce that we will work with Kite, a Gilead company, on the development ofnew gene-edited cell therapies for cancer. Gene editing is a critical component in the development of next-generation autologous and allogeneiccell therapies. Sangamo has more than a decade of experience, developing cell therapy products and translating this cutting-edge research intoclinical trials.     As Sandy pointed out, in recent years, our technology has advanced very rapidly along the 3 critical dimensions of precision, efficiency and specificity.We are now able to rapidly assemble ZFNs to precisely target any nucleoside in the genome. We have increased our ex vivo on-target efficiencyto consistently above 90%. We have learned to engineer away nonspecific binding between the ZFN and the DNA, reducing off-target cleavageto below undetectable levels. This unique profile is being recognized by partners as setting the standard for what good looks like in terms oftherapeutic genome editing. It enabled the recent gene regulation collaboration with Pfizer for C9ORF-linked ALS and frontotemporal lobardegeneration, and it was certainly recognized by Kite in the optimal way to gene edit cell therapies for cancer.     After careful consideration, we determined that building an oncology business requires specialized and dedicated expertise and that patients willbe best served by Sangamo lining ourselves with a leading partner in the oncology field with the resources, relationships and capabilities to advancenew therapies rapidly into global development and commercialization.     With the Kite collaboration, we believe we are working with the company most committed to transforming the space of new cell therapies andoncology. And we think this collaboration will optimally benefit both patients living with cancer and the use of Sangamo technology within thisfield. We are also excited that Kite, after publicly stating their interest in partnering with the gene-editing company, made the active choice of zincfingers and Sangamo for the next generation of cell therapy and oncology.     We are pleased with the scope in the strong financial terms. Kite is paying Sangamo $150 million upfront to gain an exclusive license for the useof ZFNs for gene editing of T-cells and NK, or natural killer cells to create CAR-T, TCR and NKR products in oncology. We are eligible to receive over$3 billion in milestone payments, that is $300 million per product in development, regulatory, first commercial sale and commercial sales milestonepayments for 10 or more products. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of future products resulting from the collaboration.     All Sangamo internal FTE and external passthrough expenses under the oncology research plan will be reimbursed by Kite. Sangamo will beprimarily responsible for developing and optimizing the cell therapy genome editing process, including delivering ZFNs to knock out specific targetgenes and AAVs to deliver CARs, TCRs and NKRs for autologous and allogeneic T-cell and NK cell products.     Sangamo has significant know-how from its prior experience in building genome-edited cell therapies and will be leveraging this expertise withthe goal of helping Kite build best-in-class products for patients living with liquid and solid tumor cancers.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 401                All of this experience can be directly translated to Sangamo's strategy and product development efforts in cell therapy outside of the oncologyfield and this was a critical aspect of the collaboration.     This is an important day for the evolution of Sangamo's business. We are executing on our stated strategy to externalize product development inhighly competitive markets, such as hematology, where specialized expertise, capabilities and resources are required to become competitive suchas in oncology. We will continue to collaborate and externalize product development rights along these criteria and expect, in the future, to strikeadditional partnerships across both the in vivo area in different tissue types and the ex vivo cell therapy area for different therapeutic cell types ofinterest.     Turning to Slide 12, we plan to retain and build out our own therapeutic area of businesses in rare inherited metabolic disorders, such as MPS I,MPS II and Fabry disease, where we believe we will have differentiated treatments and where the commercial strategy will involve serving patientsthrough specialized centers of excellence focused on these indications. We are also evaluating forward integration around other opportunitieswhere we may be able to develop a significant, competitive and technical advantage, such as genome-edit cell therapy for autoimmune disorders,a promising field that is still emerging similar to where immuno-oncology was a few short years ago, and precisely, where we can leverage ourdeep experience and know-how.     These are exciting times and we are thrilled to be working in therapeutic areas where the understanding of the genetics and biology is improvingrapidly and we have the optimal genomic toolkit to build great products for patients in need.     Overall, we believe this diverse therapeutic area and diversified product strategy creates significant long-term value by enabling the broaddevelopment of therapeutic applications made possible by the zinc finger platform. It also allows us to build valuable business franchises ourselves,such as the previously mentioned inherited metabolic disorders and the emerging ex vivo genome-edited cell therapy in nononcology indications,such as autoimmune.     Very importantly, for Sangamo, it is also consistent with our fundamental core values and getting the technology out there and in the right hands,which compels us to urgently develop new genomic medicines to change the lives of patients.     I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Kathy Yi, for a summary of our 2017 financial results. Kathy? Kathy Y. Yi - Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO     Thank you, Kurt. Good morning, everyone. Detailed financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 were included in the press release weissued earlier this morning. They are summarized on Slide 15. I will briefly review the most important components of our financials today, and we'llfocus on primary drivers of our growth and spending for 2018.     We ended the fourth quarter with a strong balance sheet with $244.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. The total net loss for thefourth quarter of 2017 was $13.1 million or $0.15 per share compared with $9.6 million or $0.14 per share for the same period in 2016.     Turning to today's announcement on the oncology collaboration agreement. This deal with Kite is significant from both financial and strategicconsiderations. It provides incremental cash of $150 million to further invest in new therapeutic areas beyond our current pipeline with fully fundedR&D and manufacturing costs for oncology programs.     As discussed earlier by Sandy and Kurt, we believe there are also tremendous opportunities for independent value creation in cell therapies outsideof oncology, such as autoimmune disorders.     In addition to investing in these new therapeutic areas, we intend to expand our clinical operations into Europe and build out our own GMPmanufacturing capability in our new headquarter -- corporate headquarters in, Brisbane, California. Therefore, we expect a directional increase inR&D, clinical and manufacturing expenses, and also in G&A, as our organization grows to support expansion of our pipeline.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Once the Kite collaboration receives HSRclearance, we will receive an additional $150 million. We expect our cash resources will last into the second half of 2020. We will provide additionalcolor and updated financial guidance in the next earnings call, as we incorporate the impact of the oncology deal.     Our balance sheet is very strong as we enter this exciting next phase of Sangamo's growth. We have significant potential, corporate and clinicalcatalysts this year and next, including expected proof-of-concept data from 7 genome editing, gene therapy and cell therapy clinical trials. Overthe next few years, we will continue to advance new programs toward IND. While we plan to retain some programs to take forward ourselves, ourstrategy will also continue to include partnerships for certain programs, which may provide additional potentially significant sources of upfrontcash and milestone payments in the future.     And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ed for clinical update."
4,64389261,SANGAMO THERAPEUTICS INC,02/22/2018," 1:00PM, SGMO",Q4 2017 Sangamo Therapeutics Inc Earnings Call,Edward R. Conner,"Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.",Senior VP & Chief Medical Officer,False,True,"Thank you, Kathy, and good morning to everyone on the call. We expect 2018 to be a very exciting year for Sangamo's clinical team, with datareadouts from our lead programs expected throughout the year. We now have 5 clinical programs, and I'd like to begin by reviewing recent progressfrom our 3 clinical-stage, in vivo, genome-editing programs in MPS I, MPS II and hemophilia B, starting with the CHAMPIONS MPS II clinical studyfor SB-913.     This is a dose-ascending study, enrolling up to 9 adults with attenuated MPS II into 3 dose cohorts. As a quick reminder, our gene-editing programsuse our zinc finger nuclease technology to target a precise position in the DNA just downstream of the albumin promoter in liver cells to create aspace to allow for insertion of new DNA as shown on Slide 17.     In the case of MPS II, this new DNA codes for IDS, the enzyme deficient in MPS II patients. The goal then is to have liver cells produce a steady andconsistent level of enzyme, which circulates throughout the body, enters into cells and performs its normal functions for the lifetime of the patient.     Turning to Slide 18. As Sandy mentioned, we presented preliminary safety data on the first subject in the CHAMPIONS study at the World Symposiumin San Diego in early February. As of December 27, the subject has shown no drug-related severe adverse events and their liver function testsremained within the normal range. To date, 2 subjects have been treated in the first dose cohort and the infusion of a dose of 5.00E+12 vg/kg ofSB-913 appears to be safe and well tolerated. We expect to dose the next patient early next month.     For our MPS I program using SB-318 on Slide 19, we currently have 5 sites open and we have 2 patients in screening who have passed initial labassessments. Other patients are advancing through the screening process. I expect patient enrollment to advance steadily throughout 2018 andthat we will have initial data from this program this year.     If you recall, on our third quarter call last November, we discussed our focus on enrollment of pediatric patients, the patient population where webelieve medical need is greatest for our therapies. We will include adolescents and children in the current Phase I/II studies once we have collectedappropriate safety data in adults. We will expand enrollments in these studies to Europe where EU authorities encouraged us to file a CTA forpediatric studies.     Moving on to Slide 20. Our hemophilia B program     (technical difficulty)     continues to be a challenge to enroll. We are in the process of initiating 2 additional study sites in the U.S. as well as expanding enrollment toEurope. The CTA for this study was filed at the beginning of the year and we expect to activate sites in the U.K. and enroll patients by the end ofthe year. I look forward to working with Duncan, our new VP and General Manager of Sangamo Europe, to initiate the study arms in adolescentand pediatric patients in the U.K. and begin enrollment there across the MPS I, MPS II and hemophilia B programs.     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

SB-525 is based on our AAV cDNAgene therapy approach to deliver a functional copy of the Factor VIII gene to the nucleus of liver cells. We currently have 8 sites open for the trialsand 3 patients dosed so far with another to be dosed shortly. We expect to release top line efficacy data from the SB-525 programs at the ScientificMeeting some time in mid-2018.     Next, a quick update from our ST-400 Phase I/II clinical program for beta-thalassemia on Slide 24. Our ST-400 cell therapy candidate is a differentiatedapproach to treating beta-thalassemia, mimicking naturally-occurring genetic variance in the human body to boost fetal hemoglobin expression.The manufacturing of ST-400 involves ex vivo nonviral mRNA delivery of ZFNs, a potential strategic advantage of a randomly integratinglentiviral-based approaches currently being developed.     The first site for the ST-400 study will be initiated soon. The study is designed to enroll a total of 6 patients, all to be treated with the same dose.We expect to enroll the first patient in the second quarter of this year. Subsequent patients can undergo apheresis while prior patients are enrolledand cell product is being manufactured. We do this to ensure the shortest possible enrollment time between patients.     I would like to reiterate our strategy for rolling out clinical data from our ongoing clinical trials. Rather than release efficacy data on a per-patientbasis, our plan is to release data once it has matured with appropriate post-treatment follow-up time, so that we may disclose data we believe tobe both clinically meaningful and reliable.     To close, I'm pleased with the progress our clinical team has made in 2017 and very excited about the prospects of accelerating our genome-editingstudies into the pediatric patient populations. We remain on track with our clinical milestones for 2018, and I look forward to preliminary datareadouts from our hemophilia A and MPS II studies in the next few months.     I'll now turn the call over to Michael Holmes, our Head of Research. Mike?"
5,64389261,SANGAMO THERAPEUTICS INC,02/22/2018," 1:00PM, SGMO",Q4 2017 Sangamo Therapeutics Inc Earnings Call,Michael Holmes,"Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.",VP of Research,False,True,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning. I want to take this opportunity to state how proud I am to see the hard work and achievements made by Sangamo'sR&D teams being recognized with important collaborations exemplified by today's Kite announcements as well as the C9ORF72 and hemophiliaA deals with Pfizer.     I've been at Sangamo now 17 years, focused on the development of our zinc finger protein base, genome editing and gene regulation platformsfor the treatment of patients with significant unmet medical needs. Our technology has progressed over my tenure. In the last few years, it hasadvanced by leaps and bounds.     I'm extremely proud of our team -- of our -- of how our team continues to lead this field and the strong validation that our work has received recentlyfrom external parties. And I just want to stop here and say it's truly incredible what we've accomplished, especially over the last 12 months, andthat these advancements are a result of the innovative and collaborative effort of our R&D teams.     With that, I want to bring attention to a few of our scientists, who -- whose teams have contributed to these collaborations. Ed Rebar's team forthe enhanced architectures, which we have recently begun to sketch, which allow for the rapid generation of highly precise, efficient and specificzinc fingers. Gary Lee and his team for their exciting improvements in ZFN-mediated T-cell multiplex editing for next-generation CAR-T and TCRcell therapies. Bryan Zeitler's group for their recent work in gene regulation for CNS diseases that set the foundation for the C9ORF72 partnership.And Brigit Riley, for establishing a potentially best-in-class gene therapy approach for hemophilia A, which demonstrated the diversification ofSangamo's technical capabilities in the gene therapy and led to the first partnership with Pfizer last year.     Turning to Slide 26. In the liver, where we've focused our in vivo genome editing and gene therapy approaches to treat rare diseases requiringprotein replacement. Our Fabry disease gene therapy program, ST-920, advances towards the clinic. We are currently completing the preclinicaldata package, including a study in nonhuman primates and remain on track to submit the IND application to the FDA later this year.     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

At the Keystone Symposia meeting on emerging cellular therapies earlier this month, Sangamo presented data demonstratinghighly efficient, multiplex gene editing in human T-cells with ZFNs. Multiplex editing is the ability to make multiple genetic changes in a singlestep and is critical for the development of next-generation cellular therapies to treat liquid and solid tumors in cancer. It enables simultaneousknockout of certain genes to prevent the body from rejecting the treatment and knocking the mutant genes to equip the modified T-cells withtargeted antitumor functions.     Sangamo scientist, Sumiti Jain, presented recent work in which we performed 4 edits simultaneously, all at greater than 90% efficiency resultingin 76% of modified cells containing all 4 edits. In addition to preparing to work closely with our new partner to accelerate Kite's development ofnew cell therapies in oncology, Gary and his team are now exploring how to leverage our gene-edited cell therapy expertise into other therapeuticareas outside of oncology where we'll obtain full rights, including autoimmune diseases, a promising area where cell therapy research is justbeginning.     Another key therapeutic area we are focused on involves combining our ZFP-TF gene regulation platform with novel AAVs engineered across theblood-brain barrier in order to deliver ZFP-TF broadly to CNS and regulate target gene expressions.     Turning to Slide 31. We've initiated our C9ORF72 program for ALS with Pfizer. In this program, we used ZFP-TF to distinguish the mutant allele fromwild type and to selectively downregulate the expression of the mutant form of the gene. Also, on our gene regulation work, we've been exploringthe ability of ZFP-TFs to identify and downregulate expression of tau, an area that is increasingly receiving interest in the scientific, medical andpharmaceutical research community.     This year, we are continuing our preclinical work in this program testing the safety and tolerability, and also the efficiency and specificity of ourZFP-TFs in novel AAVs and nonhuman primates. We've completed the initial pilot studies in monkeys and the treatment was well tolerated. Theresults of these in other follow-on nonhuman primate studies will read out later this year.     In closing, I want to reiterate what a remarkable time this is for Sangamo research. The labs are buzzing with excitement and energy, as we see ourwork create value for the company and our collaborations and in programs entering the clinic. I'll now turn the call back over to Sandy."

And second, just to clarify, this is for CAR Ts, TCRs and NK cell receptors. So this leaves you with B-cells, dendritic cells and other immune celltypes to edit. I'm wondering if you can talk about the potential for those other immune cell types, particularly in autoimmune disease and maybein other indications too? And I'm wondering if you'd still have the option to edit B-cells in oncology indications?"

So just first question is in terms of the targets for the gene editing for oncology purposes. I think you have reported preclinicaldata on 4 targets in -- from your preclinical studies, including CISH, TCR, beta-2M and -- so in terms -- and in terms of the collaboration, I imaginethere are more targets might be involved, like the TCR approach may involve TCR other than CAR T construct. And also the NKR program probablyinvolves additional receptors. Have you had any preclinical data working on those novel -- on those targets thus far that you haven't disclosed --reported?"

Macrae,"Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.","President, CEO & Director",True,False,"So thank you for your question. I think the best way to think about that is to step further back. The reason we and Kite and Gilead chose thispartnership rather than it being -- mentioning specific targets is because we all believe that there is both -- the targets are known now and targetsthat will be developed as this field evolves at such a rapid pace. And so although the first few targets may be ones that we've all heard of, they andwe wanted the opportunity for us to evolve with the field to be able to choose new targets that are learned from the exploration of this very newfield and for Sangamo to provide editing capabilities for them, no matter what happens, whether it was checkpoint inhibitor switches, if that'snecessary, novel targets. So we are delighted to have a truly creative partnership rather than it being on target by target. Curt, you would agree?"

That's very helpful. And also, just curious, in terms of the ability to sort cells after the genome editing process -- I was just curious what wouldthat -- capability is in terms of both positively sort-out cells and negatively sort-out cells. Just trying to get a sense because the genome editingefficiency is a key parameter, but also through sorting, I think, there's another level of enrichment that can be provided.     13     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

As we've talked about, in our recent presentations, the levels of editing are approaching 99% or higher.So in some sense, we know we can achieve levels of editing that may not really require any type of sorting or purification after the fact.     And so, obviously, we are not at this point able to go into detail, but well I think that is a possibility, and certainly, the levels of editing that we'reseeing right now, it wouldn't require much in the way of enrichment to really achieve a 100% of the population being edited."

And also, for that program, is the approach remaining to be mRNA delivery for a number of targets, and then combined with AAV deliveryfor the CAR T construct, for example, a 2-delivery approach?"

So I think, all the work that we've shown, has involved the use of ZFN mRNA delivery in the T-cells combined with AAV delivery of the donor.And that has certainly achieved best-in-class levels of genome editing.

Could you characterize the landscape for that field and the general progress that's being madein that field?"

Tregs is certainly one. The field has also looked at cell types, such as mesenchymal stem cells as ways to use their natural propertiesto suppress the immune system. And certainly, you can see that the field is really looking at the potential for genome editing to further enhance,and retarget these different cells to try and further reduce or suppress the activity of immune system to recognize self-antigens.     And so this is something that we'll obviously be talking about more in subsequent calls, but this is based off of our expertise in oncology as wellas all the previous work in HIV. We're, certainly, looking at how we can leverage what we built so far in building this best-in-class genome-editingtechnology to move into areas, such as autoimmune diseases."
