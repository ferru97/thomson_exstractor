I'm pleased to report that we made excellent progress. We closed 2017 strongerthan we expected and are generally very pleased with trends and our team's success at controlling what we can. Even more importantly, we believewe have the fundamentals in place to carry us through 2018.     For the first time since I've been here, we closed the books on a full year with positive traffic up 40 basis points, that's 300 points plus ahead of thecasual dining category, which, of course, was down again for the year, according to Black Box. This annual outperformance was the best in over 5years, and our fourth quarter marks 6 quarters in a row where we have outpaced competition and taken share.     I consider this traffic outperformance even more meaningful today as consumers have more options than ever to choose from. I also believe thewinners in this category over time will be defined by their ability to continually connect with guests in the ways they prefer, with a strong brandthat can bridge different occasions and modes of access.     Red Robin's performance last year benefited from both our multigenerational brand relevance and our agility to meet different guest needs whilemaking changes to the operating model that benefit the middle of the P&L. Our operators continue to step up their game in on-premise diningservice as measured by Net Promoter Score, taking the dramatic improvements they made in 2016 even higher to an average NPS of over 70 withunder 7% detractors for 2017, not missing a beat with the guest while dropping the expediter role or what we call Maestro. They accomplishedthis while significantly growing our off-premise business via carry out, third-party delivery and catering, which combined, were up 45% year-over-yearto an 8.3% mix in Q4. We deem this as good start toward our goal of mixing on par with others in the low to mid-teens.     Our marketing team continue to fine tune messaging and media spending, targeting markets where we have the best unit penetration withincremental corporate investment. They also continue to smartly segment and leverage our best-in-class Red Robin Royalty program, which is nowin its eighth year with $7.4 million registered members, up about 1 million members again last year. The combination of improved operations andsmarter marketing added up to a positive same-store top line sales of 2.7% in Q4, exceeding our expectations, particularly in a higher-than-anticipated53rd week.     As the first major step in changing our labor model and controlling mounting costs, our restaurant team successfully implemented Maestro in Q4,over-delivering on controls and leveraging the top line growth. This resulted in labor at 34.1% for the quarter, down 100 basis points versus prioryear. This is the level of executional precision and collective effort that we will need moving forward to successfully implement other service modelsolutions that work for our guests, our team members and our shareholders.     We continue to promote Everyday Value via our $6.99 Tavern Double menu, which, of course, is always served with your choice of bottomless sides,though I don't know why anyone would go beyond the fries, which moved to 14% menu mix by year end. We made a choice thoughtfully, informedby research in Q4 2015 to extend the Tavern menu to regain our edge on value. As you can see, we made have progress. Best in value equal topsand likelihood to recommend, equal best-in-class traffic growth. We will not cede leadership on this measure. We will continue to drive affordableabundance as a key differentiator.     In sum, 2017 set us up to maximize profitability via further productivity improvement while continuing to build same-store sales and traffic, primarilythrough off-premise channels. We know we must improve returns to earn the right to grow again. We do not necessarily believe that the traditionalunit prototype is the best means through which to grow in the future, which is why we pause unit development beginning in 2019.     Full service, as we have always defined it, likely won't hunt in the changing cost and operating environment ahead. We are actively exploring newways for guests to experience Red Robin, and we'll be ready to invest to capitalize on new opportunities if and when they are proven.     To ensure we have sufficient resources to focus on that new future while also delivering on our in-year commitment, our leadership team cametogether recently to reset the organization, streamlining home office and field structure to free up resources to fuel dedicated transformationactivities and reduce our committed expenses by over $14 million year-over-year. Organizational resets like this are never easy but they are critical.Structure must follow strategy. We reset ours to be more nimble going forward. We've also chosen to invest about half of the projected 2018 taxsavings to accelerate several initiatives, which require one-time use of outside innovation resources.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

We are committed to delivering positive traffic again this year and continuing to outperform our category. We are committedto aggressively growing our off-premise business.

And we will set ourselves up for the model changes neededthat will allow us to grow again in the future.     With that, let's all turn to Guy for the details on Q4 2017 year-end and our 2018 outlook, or as we know it around here, the annual Guydance."
3,64389939,RED ROBIN GOURMET BURGERS INC,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, RRGB",Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call,Guy J. Constant,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.",CFO & Executive VP,False,True,"Thank you, Denny, and good afternoon, everyone. As I walk you through the highlights of our financial results for the fourth quarter, please notethat the numbers I present are on a recurring basis, excluding special items.     As Denny outlined, the fourth quarter of 2017 extended Red Robin's run of significant traffic and sales outperformance versus the casual diningindustry, outperforming our peers by 360 basis points. We have also continued to expand on our 2-year outperformance versus our casual diningpeers, now tracking at 580 basis points as measured by Black Box.     You may also recall that last quarter, we introduced that we have developed an additional benchmark that compares us to top quartile best-in-classcompetitors for the entire industry, not just casual dining. For Q4, we outperformed this group as well, generating a positive traffic gap of 100 basispoints. Congratulations to our operations, marketing and culinary teams for continuing to deliver significantly differentiated performance.     However, as we have said for several quarters, relative outperformance is not enough. We strive to be a great business, not just a better restaurantbusiness. And the fourth quarter of 2017 demonstrated the start of the kind of results up and down the P&L that will help us deliver on that promise.As we have commented on in past quarters, a great deal of foundational work has been put in place over the past 2 years, and we are now seeingthe results from the differentiated thinking we brought to the industry and the hard work on those new ideas.     For the full year 2017, Red Robin made notable progress in a number of areas. Our team members turned negative comp sales to positive. Ourteam members delivered full year positive traffic, one of only a very small number of restaurant industry players to do so. Our team membersreversed margin declines from earlier in the year to margin improvements at the end of the year. Our team members dramatically improvedrestaurant productivity and are poised to do so again in 2018. And our team members delivered the significant positive cash flow necessary for ahealthy and stable business.     Yet to sustain the strong performance in the current casual dining environment, we need to introduce the type of changes necessary to make ourbusiness truly successful. We are making, and will continue to make, the important choices around business investments, and we will need toinnovate in a way that allows us to fully capitalize on the differentiated position that Red Robin holds with the restaurant consumer.     These actions support our intention to first return to absolute and consistent earnings growth, and then put ourselves into a position to allow usto provide growth and returns that one associates with high-performing organizations.     Now to the specific results, keeping in mind that in 2017, we featured a 53rd week versus 52 weeks in 2016. Q4 total company revenues increased17.5% to $342.4 million, up from $291.5 million a year ago, driven primarily by the 53rd week, strong comp sales and new restaurant openings.Comparable restaurant sales grew 2.7%, driven by a 1.9% increase in guest traffic and a 0.8% in average guest check. Mix decreased to 1.8%,primarily driven by heavier guest usage of our Tavern and Value menu. Overall price, after considering the impact of discounting, increased 2.6%in the quarter. This higher level of price was due to a change in timing for the price increases compared to a year ago as we took the price increasein October versus January.     We would expect to be at our expected price level of 0% to 1% starting this quarter and moving forward, consistent with our focus on driving trafficthrough greater affordability for our guests. Fourth quarter restaurant level operating margin was 20.5%, up 70 basis points versus a year ago,driven by the following factors: Cost of sales increased 90 basis points to 23.7%, driven primarily by higher cost of steak fries and higher ground     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

As Denny mentioned, restaurant labor cost decreased 100 basis points to 34.1%, driven by decreases in management labor costs,improved hourly labor productivity and health insurance cost, partially offset by an increase in restaurant manager bonus cost. The Maestro programreached full implementation in Q4 and our restaurant managers delivered on all targets related to the program.     Earlier this year, we made significant investments to improve the payout levels of our restaurant manager incentive programs. These improvedpayouts were predicated on a successful pivot to improve labor productivity and to generate better restaurant level economics while drivingimproved comp sales. We're happy to say that these changes, combined with improved operating results, produced full year 2017 restaurantmanager bonus payouts that were nearly $8 million higher than in 2016.     Other operating cost decreased 50 basis points to 13.2%, primarily due to decreases in repair and maintenance costs and lower utilities, offsetpartially by higher third-party delivery costs and restaurant technology expenses. Occupancy cost decreased 20 basis points due to lower realestate taxes.     General and administrative expense improved by 10 basis points to 6.4%, due primarily to sales leverage and despite an increase of $3.3 million inperformance-based compensation versus a year ago. Selling expenses were up 60 basis points as a percent of revenue to 4.5% due to increases inlocal marketing spend, national media spend and higher gift card costs. This quarter features a change in how we classify selling expense with allmarketing activities, including both national and local marketing and media expenses, now all represented in this line. The local marketing costmoved out of the other operating expense line. We believe this change, which is reflected for both this year and last year in the numbers, willprovide better transparency to the true marketing expense and activity for the organization moving forward.     Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $35.8 million, up approximately 22.5% versus a year ago, aided by the 53rd week, higher comp sales and improved margin.Depreciation and amortization improved by 120 basis points to 6.4%. Net interest expense and other was $2.5 million, an increase of $500,000versus the prior year, driven by higher interest rates on a revolving credit facility. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 7.2% compared to 8% ayear ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.78 as compared to $0.35 in the fourth quarter of 2016. And the 53rd week generated $29.8million in restaurant revenue, contributed approximately $4.7 million EBITDA, $4.1 million in net income and $0.39 in diluted earnings per share.     During the quarter, we recognized an impairment charge of $5.3 million related to 9 existing restaurant locations. And in addition, due to the U.S.government's enaction of comprehensive tax legislation, the company recorded a decrease related to our deferred tax liabilities, which provideda onetime tax benefit of $2.8 million.     Now for the balance sheet. We invested $22.5 million in CapEx in the fourth quarter, primarily related to restaurant maintenance capital, investmentin technology projects and new restaurant openings. We ended the quarter with $17.7 million in cash, up $6 million versus where we ended 2016,and finished the quarter with a lease adjusted leverage ratio of 4.04x. We paid down a total of $70 million of debt in 2017, and our leverage ratiohas improved a little more than a quarter turn, allowing us to materially derisk the business. We continue to press forward towards our ultimategoal of maintaining a lease adjusted leverage ratio of 3x.     As we move into 2018, I wanted to share with you our expectations for the coming year. And again let me point out that our 2018 fiscal year willreturn to its normal 52 weeks versus the 53 weeks this past year. The company expects 2018 revenues to range between a decline of 50 basis pointsand an increase of 50 basis points as compared to the 53-week 2017 revenue total. This will include a decline in operating weeks of about 1%.Comp restaurant sales are projected to grow between 50 basis points and 150 basis points.     Cost of sales is projected to increase from 50 to 100 basis points versus a year ago due to higher steak fry cost and a return to a moderately inflationarycommodity environment. At the end of 2017, approximately 60% of our 2018 food cost spend was contracted.     Restaurant labor costs are projected between an increase of 25 basis points and a decrease of 25 basis points, driven by minimum wage increasesin more highly penetrated markets and restaurant manager bonus as planned at target levels, offset by the effects of improvements in laborproductivity.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Depreciationexpense is projected to be approximately $95 million.     G&A expense is projected to be $85 million to $90 million. This includes a $3 million year-over-year increase to reset bonus to target levels. Inaddition, Denny mentioned earlier that we recently reset the organization to streamline our home office and field structure and free up resourcesstill out for reinvestment. About $10 million of those savings will be realized in the G&A line, offset partially by investment in the transformationaland technology projects that will lay the foundation for the future growth models for Red Robin.     Selling expense, which includes both national and local marketing activities, is expected to be up slightly as a percent of restaurant revenues, andpreopening expense is estimated to be approximately $3 million due to fewer new restaurant openings. Our income tax rate is projected to rangebetween 0% and 5% for 2018. As Denny outlined, we expect to invest some of the tax savings in 2018 to accelerate initiatives to enhance the guestexperience, put technology in our team members' hands to improve their work experience and further improve productivity, and to identify thenext growth models for Red Robin as mentioned earlier.     Earnings per diluted share is projected to range from $2.40 to $2.80 which represents an increase of 14% to 33% versus a year ago when normalizing2017 for the 53rd week. We expect Q1 earnings per diluted share between $0.60 and $0.80, reflecting both a challenging start to 2018 for theindustry and the loss of 1 high-volume revenue week versus a year ago due, again, to the 53rd week.     Overall CapEx is projected to be between $65 million and $75 million as we shift capital investment from lower return new unit opening to higherreturn restaurant technology and kitchen investments that will increase revenue and improve productivity. We expect to open 3 to 5 new RedRobin restaurants in 2018, net of closures, and we expect to use excess free cash flow after CapEx to pay down outstanding debt.     While we can look back on 2017 as a year of significant transition, what is most important was the work our team members did to put the companyin a position to both further improve our existing business and to aggressively and rapidly reinvent Red Robin for future growth. Our traffic numbersare at the top of the industry. Our NPS scores are reaching record levels. Our off-premise growth is exceeding our expectations. Our restaurantexecution is best-in-class. And we are making significant progress on a new and different service model for this space.     Before I close, let me once again congratulate our operators and our marketing team for another quarter of differentiated performance. We'vetaken great care of our guests and our team members, and have, again, been good stewards of our company resources, all while absorbing significantchange to the service model. We will continue to prioritize our capital and operating investments based on the incremental returns on capital thatthese investments will create. Whether these priorities drive sales, improve margins, reduce expenses, generate EBITDA or distribute capital toshareholders, the overriding filter will be the expected return of that incremental capital or an improved return on capital already invested, as it isthe focus on overall returns that is most highly correlated to overall improvements in total shareholder return.     With that, I'll turn the call back to Denny for a few final comments before we take your questions."

It's hard to parse the difference between Everyday Value as it shows up in off-premise versus dine-in, butthere is no doubt that the off-premise occasion is the one that's growing the most rapidly.

We won't be taking price this January, we just took it early. And so we would expect our pricing to beflat to up 1% as a rule of thumb going forward. So we're definitely not pricing to try and offset the mix. In terms of the -- what we think about PPAand mix going forward, if the guests desire and the way we can drive value, as Denny said, is to allow the Tavern mix to extend, I think we're okaywith that. I think as we talked about, affordability and values are very important component for us. So we're not necessarily trying to push hard todrive our PPA higher. We want to make sure we maintain affordability for the guest. And of course, the best way to do that is to do the work infixing the fundamental business model so we can continue to offer that profitably.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

As we look to Q1, one of the issues, as you consider modeling, is while there -- it's a 16-week quarter thisyear as it was last year. The first 2 weeks of the quarter last year were the week after Christmas and the week after New Year's which are 2 of yourhighest volume weeks in the entire calendar year. This year, of course, because of the 53rd week, took us through to the end of the calendar year.This year's first quarter will only have the week after New Year's in it.

I understand you were looking at sort of differentways of growing the business. But I'm just curious if there's anything new in your thinking along those lines? I know you're testing a store, but itjust feels like you're looking at something new. And then the second question, more specifically, Guy, is the delta in returns from a low margin unitto high margin or a high return -- or a low return unit to a high return, other investments into improving your store performance? I'm just curiousof what the difference in the returns are, if you've seen those."

We're continuingto look at ways that we can address the rising labor costs and find new ways in our existing 4-walls to help the guest. And so you'll hear a lot ofthat. That's what we consider transformation. And we've got a lot to focus on that right now, a number of different things we're looking at. But aswe bring those forward, expand them beyond very initial pilots, we'll share our results at that time."

Constant,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.",CFO & Executive VP,True,False,"Yes, and maybe just to add to that before I answer your other question, Howard, we were leaning heavily into the technology investment. We'rein the process of expanding the technology capacity in our current restaurants. We're doing an upgrade to our current point-of-sale software andour food cost management system. We're putting catering software in our restaurants. We're going to put technology in the hands of our serversto improve their productivity, improve the guest experience. So we feel like improving those 4-wall economics, which does lead into your secondquestion, is an important focus of ours. Rather than building new 4 walls, we need to make the 4 walls that we've got operate much better. In termsof the delta between returns, I mean, I don't know that I'd want to get into the specifics, but we've got units, as you might imagine, that do northof 6 million in volume on an annual basis and we've got some that do 2 million. And so as you can imagine, the return profile is dramatically differentbetween those 2. As we think about refranchising the system, those factors enter in to our equation as we think about would we earn a betterreturn with those models being franchised as opposed to being company-owned. Which is why we set the goals around increasing our franchisemix. And of course, any of these initiatives we're working on to drive comp sales or invest in technology and improve labor productivity will -- sortof will be the tide that lifts all the boats in the system. And so that's where we're focused on right now, improve the 4-wall economics. Doing better     11     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

And I'm looking for somebody totell me exactly the number, but yes, we're limited by, I want to say maybe 60%. Curbside uptake, I think, is not as high as perhaps we had expectedinitially. Delivery is definitely the growing category. Third-party delivery is huge and growing rapidly. And for the fact that it's only in about half ofour locations, it's over-representing right now in terms of growth. In terms of difference in check average, really not much difference in checkaverage. The biggest challenge with anything in off-premise is the loss of the beverage sale, but the guest does seem to get more food even thoughthe average eaters per check is lower. So they embark, they take advantage of getting more food but don't get the beverage. But curbside has notbeen the dramatic growth piece that we expected. A lot of folks are still walking in.

Can you quantify, as you think about your labor outlook for 2018, can you quantify the labor savingsbetween the Maestro and other initiatives that are embedded in that guidance? Or have you just embedded the Maestro at this point and therecould be potentially more to come? Can you give us some perspective there?"

Constant,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.",CFO & Executive VP,True,False,"Oh, no, we have other changes embedded in the guidance because the Maestro is worth about $8 million, you will recall, Brian, and we startedthat in the fourth quarter. So call it 3 quarters of that benefit or $6 million of the improvement will come from Maestro. And for us to offsetmid-single-digit inflation on our labor basket, we obviously need a lot more than the Maestro program in order to get to that down 25 to up 25 onlabor as a percent of revenues. So we are definitely assuming some other changes in that guidance."

Just in terms of the quantification of the shift in the week. I think from what you've given us, the extra week from 2017,there's probably 15% to 20% higher than a normal week, which if I do the math, sort of suggests the $5 million move from the first quarter to thefourth quarter. And so we should be like removing $5 million from the first quarter and then adding that on to the fourth quarter. Is that roughlythe right way we should be thinking about kind of the math there?"

Constant,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.",CFO & Executive VP,True,False,"Yes. I think that's roughly correct, Greg. That if you take into account how much higher the 53rd week is than a typical week, and obviously youhave to think about it in a typical Q1 week, that's probably a reasonable assumption as to how you should move the dollars around."

On the 0% to 5% guide, I wanted to make sure that was a sort of a sustainable numberas we think about '18 into '19. Is that a number we can count on kind of going forward? Is there anything to point out in '18 that might be a littlebit different than what we might expect in future years?"

As earnings rise, tax rate tends to rise, and as earnings go down, tax rategoes down. But assuming the numbers that we guided to, that's a reasonable rate to assume going forward."
