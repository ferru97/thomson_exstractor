1,64388649,"VISTEON, CORP",02/22/2018," 2:00PM, VC",Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call,Ryan J. Brinkman,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",Senior Equity Research Analyst,False,True,"And the question is about the bookings number, was extremely strong in the fourth quarter, to the layman, it would appear thatyou're well on track to exceed the 2017 and 2018 sort of combined $12 billion number. Is that the way we should look at it? Or doesit relate somehow to a different cadence, some wins you thought that might land in the first quarter of '18, and in fact, fell in thefourth quarter of '17? And what does this imply for your sort of, I think, it's [8.7%] sort of organic CAGR through 2021, et cetera? Areyou potentially now in a position to be maybe ahead of plan?"
2,64388649,"VISTEON, CORP",02/22/2018," 2:00PM, VC",Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call,Sachin S. Lawande,Visteon Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",False,True,"Ryan, first of all, yes, we are very happy with our record setting performance in 2017 with respect to new business wins. What I wouldsay with respect to our longer-term revenue target is that, this performance increases our confidence, first of all, in achieving thattarget with the wins that we've had in 2017 now, I would say, over more than 60% of the 2021 target of $4.7 billion in revenue isalready in our backlog or already sourced. So the way we should think of it is that our confidence in delivering our 2021 revenuetarget is now significantly higher. Having said that, our revenue outlook depends on a few other things, such as vehicle productionforecasts as well as currency. So our target for 2018 for new business wins remains the same, roughly about $6 billion. The salespipeline looks very strong, so we expect to have another strong year. And as we always do, we will update our outlook for 2021 atthe end of the year and then provide you with an update at the next Deutsche Bank conference. But overall, again, a very strongyear. We feel good about our prospects in the 2020, 2021 timeframe, as we have said earlier in this year as well. And I think it alsopositions us well in terms of being able to deliver a strong 2018."

Brinkman,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",Senior Equity Research Analyst,False,True,"Okay, great, and then just lastly from me. We saw that earlier announcement that you had won that sort of design win for SmartCorein Europe, and without producing all of the associated hardware. And now today, you've got this announcement of a software-onlyPhoenix win. Can you kind of talk about the implications of that? Do you prefer to produce the associated hardware also? Or are youmore attracted to a software or design approach because of the positive implications to margin and presumably return on investedcapital?"
4,64388649,"VISTEON, CORP",02/22/2018," 2:00PM, VC",Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call,Sachin S. Lawande,Visteon Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",False,True,"Yes. Let me talk first about this win and then I'll also invite Christian to talk about the margin. So if you look at the sales cycle for atypical conquest infotainment win, it's usually more than a year. And so we are very happy to have 2 wins in Phoenix within a yearof the launch of the platform. So this second win is for an European OEM, and this is for their existing infotainment systems that theywanted to upgrade to be able to host web apps in a downloadable fashion. So we are providing the Phoenix runtime and the studiodeveloper software to enable the OEM and the third parties to create downloadable apps for this infotainment system. This is asoftware-only sale, and as such, the business model relies on a royalty that we collect on a per unit basis. And since this is an existinginfotainment system, the initial start of production is actually Q3 of this year. So it -- I would say, it's a great validation of our softwareoriented approach to our platforms. It represents an acceleration of revenue and as a software-only business, the margins are whatyou'd expect from a software business. Christian, would you like to add something?     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Garcia,Visteon Corporation,Executive VP & CFO,False,True,"Yes, the only thing I would add, Ryan, is that when you think about the software only, it actually provides us the ability to experimentwith various revenue models, which we did not have without having this platform-based technology like Phoenix. It is also interestingto note that the hardware is based on somebody else's as a competitor's hardware. So it actually gives us the ability to port ourtechnology on somebody else's platform, so which is kind of really interesting."

Lawande,Visteon Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",False,True,"And the last thing I would add, Ryan, to your question, whether we would prefer to offer software only or along with the hardware.It really is a choice that we don't get to make in most of those cases. This is the OEM in most cases that decides that. We do expecta few other opportunities in this way where on account of the installed base of infotainment systems that lack the ability to offer anapp environment, there is a demand for the kind of software that we offer with Phoenix. But in the vast majority of the cases, weexpect that the OEMs will want a complete system hardware along with the software pre-integrated like what we typically woulddo in normal business."

And I guess, the question is, as you move more and moretowards software-based enterprise, should we think about CapEx running higher than the 3% of sales that it's typically run at? AndI guess is there a corresponding offset to R&D?"

So in terms of the CapEx, just to give you the magnitude of the increase that we have, we had about $25 millionincrease in CapEx year-on-year. But 2/3 are what you would consider normal CapEx, which is the plant equipment and so forth thatwe needed to support the new program wins that we're having. And 1/3 of that is also -- 1/3 of the increase is the software developmentcosts that you talked about. So going forward, yes, the software development cost is actually helpful in our R&D, but as you recall,when we guided in Deutsche Bank of what happens in 2018, we have -- our engineering expense is expected to increase becauseof the incremental investments that we have in autonomous driving."

And so, I would have thought from an ASP perspective, those2 might actually offset, but you're still saying that ASPs are up 10%. So I guess, within embedded infotainment, are those ASPs higheras well year-over-year?"
13,64388649,"VISTEON, CORP",02/22/2018," 2:00PM, VC",Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call,Sachin S. Lawande,Visteon Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",False,True,"Yes, so the embedded infotainment ASPs are maintaining their pricing levels. So what is really happening here is that the displayaudio is significantly higher than the audio that it is replacing, and that is what is helping the average ASP go up by about 10% forus -- for the full amount. The way to think of it is, as you mentioned, we are winning in all of the 3 segments. This is a turnaroundyear, 2017 was a turnaround year for us in infotainment, and it's really driven on account -- by the fact that we have made someinvestments in our platforms and then we talked about Phoenix, it scales really well from entry infotainment all the way to mid-highand the strength that we have on account of the acquisition of AllGo in our -- the smartphone projection capabilities, which are veryimportant, not just for display audio segment, but also for embedded."

And then on the Phoenix software side, on the software side, I know that it is a little early but on the royalty, can you giveus a little bit more color, I mean, relative to, like units that you anticipate?

It really depends on the content. So it's hard to put a specific number. There is a lot of feature content that drives the royaltystructure but it's in the range that you just mentioned, it's a -- in this particular case, as we mentioned, there is an existing infotainmentsystem. So this is adding to the capabilities, especially with regard to the ability to download apps from the Internet and run themsecurely on the infotainment system. As we go forward and there is additional features that Phoenix will deliver, including all of thebase infotainment capabilities, then the value of that software would increase.

I think you've discussed that market growing 25% to 30%.Your new wins are growing 70%. How much of the outgrowth today is barriers to entry that you sort of brought up the complexityof the product kind of boxing out or excluding a lot of legacy cluster suppliers versus technology or cost leadership, you would sayVisteon has even against competing companies that do have a digital product but it's just not quite what you're offering?"
24,64388649,"VISTEON, CORP",02/22/2018," 2:00PM, VC",Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call,Sachin S. Lawande,Visteon Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",False,True,"Yes, so Joe, first thing I would mention here is that one of the key capabilities in our a all-digital cluster, there are 2 in fact, one is thedisplay, the other is the software. And when it comes to the digital display, Visteon has always had a very strong capability inautomotive digital displays. We ship over $400 million worth of digital displays every year. So we have a strong capability in takingLCD panels and then treating them and bonding and fabricating the automotive displays that have to withstand the conditionswithin the car and meet critical requirements. This is not something that most players in the space have, as a vertically integratedcapability. So that's one element of that. The other is the software. And then, so what has happened here with software is that besideshaving the key capabilities in terms of the technology, we, at Visteon, have critical mass in terms of supporting the specific vehiclearchitectures of a wide number of automakers in the world. So we have now a broad-based platform that we can take to automakersthat more than likely supports their requirements out of the box. That's different from, say with many other of our competitors, thatreduces the risk to the program, reduces our cost in developing that cluster, and this is one of the main reasons why we have wonas much business as we've won. This is the second year that -- in a row that we have won about $3.8 billion, $3.9 billion in clustersand when you look at the market, which is on an annual basis, somewhere around $7 billion, it represents a significant market share.So we do expect, however, that as we go forward, more of the automakers to transition towards all-digital. And again, momentumis a very good thing, and this should put us in a good shape to win more of the business going forward in all-digital clusters.     11     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

So I remember back when you took the infotainment platform at Harman and that was reallythe turning point to getting infotainment into the Japanese automakers. Obviously, they value performance but they're also reliabilitycost sensitive.

I think this is -- this would really enable us to build and demonstrate our capability in Japan, in thatmarket, which is a difficult market for most non-Japanese suppliers to crack into.

And then just my last question. The shift to all-digital clusters really hit its stride in 2017.

Can you talk to the potential for additional SmartCore new business wins in 2018 beyond? And really it's just -- has thebid presence dramatically increased? Or do you see this more as an opportunity of a gradual increase in wins because of the longleave cycle and transitioning to a single ECU?     12     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

So you are absolutely right that this move towards all-digital clusters really drives demand for increased computing resources,including processors, memory and software. And the need is really driven by the sort of the drive towards rendering digital contentin the clusters and information that comes typically from an infotainment system. As we see more of these types of solutions, thatis also a big sort of a driver behind the integration of infotainment and the cluster because it's a lot more effective to have those 2systems run off of a single electronic control unit or ECU to be able to share that information seamlessly between the 2 displays.Now as we have, I think, in my prepared script mentioned that the momentum in cockpit domain controllers is also picking up, andthe pipeline of new opportunities for 2018 is very robust. In fact, it has never been greater. So we are very optimistic about havingmore success with SmartCore that integrates infotainment and cluster on the single ECU as we go forward here in 2018 and beyond."

Theimpact of pricing in any quarter is dependent on the negotiations that we have, with individual OEMs and the programs that theyrelate to. So as such, there could be a lot of unevenness between quarters. Now having said that, if you look at the entire year, theimpact was $86 million or a little bit above 2.5% of revenues, which is in line with our historical rate.

And then let me try to describe to you the way we see the opportunities in autonomous. So if youlook at the industry and some of the things that you're hearing in media, there are really 2 sort of directions that the industry istaking. On one side, there is this push towards fully autonomous, perhaps in more limited domains intended for application such asrobot access and for freight movers in trucks that have a point-to-point limited by sort of a specific geofenced area. So that's oneinitiative. The other initiative is targeted more towards consumer car owners. And in this area, the goal is to upgrade the currentLevel 1, Level 2 ADAS capabilities into Level 3, more automated driving. So at Visteon, we are really focused on working with ourtraditional long-term customers in enabling and upgrading Level 1, Level 2 into Level 3. Now the key features there that we expectto be of initial interest would be highway pilot and remote self-parking. So what we are doing now is we're very focused on developinga very cost-effective solution based on DriveCore that meets the requirements of highway pilot and self-driving. And so this is wherewe would expect as we go -- as we make more progress in releasing these capabilities and launching these features, we'd expect to     13     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

I think you've talked about getting to 14% over time. Guidance for this year is relatively flat. I mean, whatare the drivers? Is it really now at this point depending on the inflection in the sales backlog? Or do you still see more cost opportunities?I know in the past, you've talked about your kind of higher than average on SG&A. Are you now in line? Or what's the opportunityleft for margin?     14     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

If you think about the opportunities between where we are right now, a little short of 12%, 11.8% tothe 14%, they're really 3 buckets. One is cost efficiency such as you've pointed out, the other one is shift to software platform-basedofferings that has accretive pressure on our margins, and the third is fixed cost leverage as we get bigger at a higher revenue base.If you think about the margin progression, from where we are to the 14% target that we've communicated, the fixed cost leveragewill happen towards the back end of that as we get -- as we translate or generate the revenues from our backlog. And so that wouldcome in later. The other one is the shift to lower software and platform-based offerings. It's still quite nascent. And as such, theimprovement in margins for the first few years before that 5-year plan of 2021 will be coming from cost efficiencies."

Garcia,Visteon Corporation,Executive VP & CFO,False,True,"Yes, yes, when you think about the incremental margins that we are looking at between the 11.8% to 14%, it's the incrementalmargins around less than 20%, right? So as such we still believe that there's cost efficiencies that could -- that we could generatefrom our current fixed cost structure."

So if you think about what happened this year for SG&A, we had a modest increase in revenues. However, SG&A was flat, right?So that means, we continue to see leverage on top of that. So we believe that we can continue to, even if it in a flattish revenue,flattish SG&A cost level. As we increase our revenues, then our SG&A as a percent of sales would actually come down."

And just lastly, how should we think about the cadence wins for SmartCore, Phoenix and then DriveCore? I mean it seems likeSmartCore, I think, it had 2 this year, 2 the prior year, Phoenix 2 this year? Should we -- should I start to accelerate or is this just sortof steady as you go?"

So yes, as I said, that the cycle of, the sale cycle I should say for infotainment is usually more than a year. Sonow, you would expect that we would start to see a pickup in activity with respect to infotainment new business activity and newbusiness wins. The same for SmartCore. SmartCore has seen a sort of continuous increase in momentum with automakers and thepipeline in both infotainment and SmartCore looks pretty strong. So I would expect that we would see a pickup in new businessactivity for those 2 products. With respect to DriveCore, again, it's relatively new for us and for the industry. So there's a lot ofdiscussions that need to happen and business models that need to evolve. So I would say that, that is still in a prebusiness-developmentphase. I would expect more sort of a pick up to offer perhaps later in the year or early next.     15     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.
