Good morning, and thank you all for joining us.     This morning, we released our fiscal 2018 second quarter financial results, and I'm proud to report our 10th consecutive quarter of improvedyear-on-year profitability. We increased pretax earnings by 20.4% compared to the second quarter of last year.     2     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Thesepositive trends are direct results of the focus and dedication of the entire Brady team on the execution of our strategy.     This is Brady's strongest quarter of organic sales growth since the first quarter of fiscal 2012, which was 25 quarters ago. As we've stated previously,our first priority was to strengthen the foundation of our business to improve profitability and cash flow in order to invest more significantly inR&D to generate sustained, long-term sales growth.     Having turned our overall business around from negative growth to flat and now to growth above U.S. GDP rates, we are now pushing to makesure that we drive consistent and strong profitable growth.     Our priorities remain the same, which are to develop high-quality innovative products, to serve our customers extremely well, to drive efficienciesthroughout our manufacturing facilities and to streamline our SG&A structure. Maintaining focus on these key priorities is working as this quartermarks 2.5 straight years of year-on-year pretax profit growth.     We've made a great deal of progress on operating efficiencies, and we continue to identify new opportunities from our manufacturing facilities toour back-office activities. We are building momentum as an entire organization.     We continue to invest in research and development, for our expenses were up another 19% this quarter. I'm really excited about the work we'redoing in R&D. We have a team of creative engineers, who in conjunction with our product management team, sales force and most importantly,our customers, are constantly challenging themselves to develop better solutions for our end users.     Our Identification Solutions business continues to be strong, posting its third consecutive quarter of organic sales growth. We're growing in all 3regions, and we're gaining positive momentum throughout this business. Although the health care segment of this business is still challenging,this portion of the business is expected to improve in the second half of the year.     The team is executing extremely well, capturing new sales opportunities and ensuring that we're providing the highest level of customer service.     Our Workplace Safety business reported a strong profit improvement of 16.4% compared to the second quarter of last year. Our European WPSbusiness continues to be leading this division's results. This leadership team is effective and efficient and consistently drives our strategy anddelivers organic sales and profit growth.     Pricing pressures continue to be a challenge, primarily in the WPS business in the Americas, and we don't expect that to change anytime soon.We're addressing these challenges by providing additional value to our customers with our industry-leading safety and compliance expertise byoffering customized and proprietary products in Identification and Workplace Safety spaces by delivering excellent customer service, by improvingour customer experience through advanced digital platforms and by upgrading our manufacturing capabilities. This strategy and our approachof providing significant value to our customers has been working as our turnaround of the WPS business is progressing. This quarter's profit andsales improvement is an important milestone in our turnaround.     We remain focused on the long term by taking action today that will result in sustained process improvement. Our focus for this fiscal year isconsistent, which is to continue to serve our customers, drive efficiency through every function of our business and improve our underperformingbusinesses. We're driving organic sales growth every single day, and we believe we're making the right investments today to deliver consistentorganic sales growth in both of our divisions.     The results of our efforts is the achievement of our financial goals and delivering long-term value to our shareholders. And I'm proud to report 2.5years of quarterly profit improvement.     Now I'll turn the call over to Aaron to discuss our financial results for the second quarter, then I'll be back to provide specific commentary aboutour Identification Solutions and Workplace Safety businesses.

3,64388528,BRADY CORP.,02/22/2018," 3:30PM, BRC",Q2 2018 Brady Corp Earnings Call,Aaron James Pearce,Brady Corporation,CFO & Treasurer,False,True,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. The financial review starts on Slide #3.     Sales increased 7.4% to $287.8 million in the second quarter, which consisted of organic sales growth of 3.2% and an increase of 4.2% from foreigncurrency translation.     We remain committed to R&D, and this quarter, we once again increased our investments in new product development. R&D expense was $11.3million, which is an increase of 19.3% over the second quarter of last year.     We continued our trend of increased earnings this quarter, as pretax earnings were up 20.4% to $35 million compared to $29.1 million in last year'ssecond quarter.     This profit improvement was primarily driven by organic sales growth in IDS and profitability improvements in both our IDS and WPS businesses,along with our constant focus on driving efficiencies throughout our G&A structure.     Net earnings finished at $4.3 million this quarter compared to $25.3 million last year. In last year's second quarter, we benefited from alower-than-normal income tax rate of 13%, which was caused by certain onetime tax benefits from a large cash repatriation. This year, we recognizedadditional tax expense of $21.1 million or approximately $0.40 of EPS as a result of the U.S. tax legislation that was enacted in December. Withoutthis tax charge, our EPS would have been $0.48 this quarter.     Lastly, cash flow from operating activities was $7.7 million this quarter compared to $19.3 million in last year's second quarter, and free cash flowwas $3 million this quarter compared to $16 million in last year's second quarter.     Slide #4 details our quarterly sales trends. Again, total sales grew 7.4% and organic sales grew 3.2% versus the second quarter of last year. Thisquarter marks our third consecutive quarter of total company organic sales growth. We're gaining momentum, and we're focused on executingour strategy to continue this trend of growth for the rest of the fiscal year.     On Slide #5, you'll find an overview of our gross profit margin trending. Our gross profit margin was 49.9% this quarter, which is a decrease of 20basis points compared to last year's gross profit margin of 50.1%.     We're continuing to identify and execute efficiency opportunities throughout our global operations, which is effectively offsetting pricing challengesin certain product categories.     Moving along to Slide #6, you'll find our SG&A expense trending. SG&A was $97.6 million this quarter compared to $94.7 million in the secondquarter of last year. This increase was entirely due to foreign currency translation. In fact, in constant currencies, our SG&A expense was downapproximately $1 million or 1%.     We remain focused on improving our processes and driving our waste throughout our SG&A structure. We're reinvesting a portion of these savingsback into direct sales and marketing resources that will help drive future sales, while the remainder of the efficiency gains are helping deliveraccelerated bottom line growth.     Slide #7 details our increased investment in R&D. We've increased our R&D expenditures both in absolute dollars and as a percent of sales againthis quarter. Our commitment to growing organic sales over the long term involves a steady introduction of highly innovative proprietary products.We believe that investing back in Brady to the development of innovative new products that add significant value to our customers are theinvestments that will have the highest rate of return and are essential to our long-term success.     R&D expense was up 19.3% this quarter, and we expect this trend to continue with our full fiscal year 2018 expense expected to be up approximately15% when compared to last year.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 351                Turning to Slide #8, you'll see the trending of our earnings per share and our net earnings. As I mentioned, our results were significantly impactedby tax reform that was enacted during the quarter, which reduced diluted EPS by approximately $0.40.     In last year's second quarter, we realized a lower-than-normal tax rate of 13%, primarily from a cash repatriation of over $125 million to the U.S.This transaction benefited our diluted EPS by $0.09 last year. So if you exclude the 2 tax-related items, our EPS would have been $0.48 this quartercompared to $0.40 in last year's second quarter.     To move beyond the noise in our tax rate and see Brady's true earning trends that makes much more sense to look at earnings before income tax,which is the chart in the lower left-hand corner of this page, specifically, you can see that our pretax earnings have shown an impressive run aswell, with our streak of year-over-year pretax earnings growth reaching 10 quarters, with growth of 20.4% this quarter, all of which while increasingour investments in R&D.     This brings us to Slide #9, which provides a summary of our cash generation. We generated $7.7 million of cash flow from operating activities thisquarter compared to $19.3 million in last year's second quarter.     Contributing to the lower free cash flow this quarter was a slight increase in CapEx, combined with cash outflows for the payments of our annualincentive-based compensation and an increase in accounts receivable as a result of our stronger organic sales this quarter.     Looking at this chart, you can see the cash flow from operating activities typically runs well above net earnings, and we expect this to continueinto the future. We consistently approach every decision with a cash-focused mindset and expect to continue generating free cash flow in excessof net earnings over the long term.     Moving along to Slide #10, you'll find the trending of our net cash position as well as a summary of our debt structure at the end of the quarter. AtJanuary 31, we were in a net cash position of $44.1 million compared to a net debt position of $37.7 million at this time last year. This is animprovement of over $80 million in the last 12 months.     As we look at deploying our cash, our approach to capital allocation is disciplined and patient. First, we use our cash to fund organic growthopportunities throughout the cycle, which includes funding investments in new product development, IT improvements, capability enhancingcapital expenditures, et cetera.     Second, we focus on returning cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends, which we've consistently increased every year since going public.     After funding organic growth investments and dividends, we then patiently deploy our cash in a disciplined manner for acquisitions where webelieve we have strong synergistic opportunities. And we use our cash to improve shareholder returns through opportunistic share repurchases.     At January 31, 2018, we had 2 million shares authorized for purchase. Overall, our cash generation has been strong, our balance sheet is strong,and we're focused on driving long-term value to our shareholders through our disciplined allocation of capital.     Before getting to our updated guidance, let me provide some comments on our income tax rate and what we expect the impact of the new U.S.tax legislation to be on our future financials, which is outlined on Slide #11.     In total, we took a noncash tax charge of $21.1 million this quarter. The key phrase is that these are noncash charges for Brady. Although thelegislation is quite complicated and there are numerous items that will impact our future tax rates, there are 3 main items to point out.     First, a major part of the U.S. tax bill passed in December is a onetime tax on deemed repatriations. Brady's cash outlay from this provision is expectedto be 0. Again, we won't have any out-of-pocket cash or expense from this provision.     Second, we need to revalue our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and our current earnings to reflect the new lower U.S. tax rates.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

The summary of the impact of all of these items, along with the reassessment of our search in related to permanently invested foreign earnings,makes up our tax charge of $21.1 million.     As we look at our future tax rates, there are also a few items to point out. First, the way that the tax bill was written is such that there are certainaspects that could phase in for a non-calendar year-end company such as Brady. This includes the reduction in tax rates.     As such, our U.S. federal tax rate this year will drop from the statutory rate of 35% to 26.9%. Then, on August 1, 2018, our U.S. federal tax rate willfurther drop to the headline rate of 21%.     The impacts of this rate reduction and the provisional expense that we booked this quarter may also require further refinance to our tax expenselater this fiscal year. Also, there are numerous pieces of tax legislation that don't become effective for Brady until August 1, 2018.     As such, the tax rate that we'll see in our third and fourth quarters of this year will not necessarily be indicative of our ongoing future tax rates.     Excluding the impact of the tax charges recorded this quarter and any further noncash adjustments in Q3 or Q4 related to this legislation, we expectthat our tax rate will be approximately 27% to 29% for the full year ending July 31, 2018. And then, beyond this fiscal year, we expect that ourlonger-term tax rates will decline from our historical ranges of 27% to 29% to a new range of 25% to 27%.     Slide #12 summarizes our guidance for the full fiscal year ending July 31, 2018. We're updating our full year diluted EPS guidance range from ourcurrent range of $1.85 to $1.95 to our new fiscal 2018 guidance range of $1.90 to $2 per share, exclusive of the tax charge that I just mentioned.     Our increased guidance is a result of 2 primary factors. First, is to reflect our stronger operating results, as our organic sales have improved and wecontinue to make strides in driving efficiencies throughout our business. Embedded in these improved operating results are further increases inour R&D spend as we now anticipate R&D cost to be up approximately 15% this year.     Second, we anticipate benefiting from the weakened dollar against certain other major currencies, including the euro. Although weaker dollarversus currencies such as the Chinese yuan can be a negative for us, in general, Brady benefits from a weaker dollar.     Included in our F '18 guidance is low-single-digit organic sales growth, which will be driven by continued strength in our ID Solutions business.Our guidance is based on foreign currency exchange rates as of January 31, 2018, and includes other key operating assumptions, includingdepreciation and amortization expense of approximately $26 million and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million.     Our capital expenditure plan decreased as we no longer expect that the purchase of certain strategic facilities will occur this year. We're notanticipating any restructuring charges, and we're not excluding any onetime item from this guidance other than the $21 million of tax chargesthat I just mentioned.     I'll now turn the call back to Michael to cover our divisional results. Michael?"

Slide #13 summarizes the Identification Solutions' second quarter financial results. IDS sales increased by 8.1% this quarter,finishing at $206.4 million, with organic sales improving 4.7% and with foreign currency translation increasing sales by another 3.4%.     Organic sales growth was led by EMEA and Asia, with both regions posting growth in the high single digits, while organic sales increased in theAmericas in the low single digits in the quarter.     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

The team is focusedand dedicated and continues to win new business while growing sales with our existing customer base.     Organic sales grew throughout the IDS Americas region, with the strongest growth in our Wire product and Product ID product lines. We're gainingmomentum and growing both sales and profit within most of our key product lines in this region.     Mid-single-digit sales growth within our U.S. industrial customers was partially offset by a decline in organic sales in our health care product line.We continue to face pricing pressures due to factors specific to the health care market, which includes consolidation of food purchasing organizationsand large health care organizations and the uncertainty presented in the legislative direction of health care in the U.S.     We're addressing these pricing pressures through our continued investment in R&D. In fact, we've increased our investment in health care R&Dprojects by 28% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year.     Our new product development process remains a key area of focus for us. We're partnering with our customers to better understand their needs,and we're incorporating their feedback into our planned new product launches and updates. I'm excited about the work that we're doing in R&D,and I'm looking forward to new product releases in the upcoming quarters.     IDS finished the second quarter with $34.1 million of segment profit, which is an increase of 17.7% over the second quarter of last year. This is adirect result of the team's focus on growing organic sales while identifying efficiencies throughout our manufacturing facilities and SG&A.     As a percentage of sales, segment profit improved to 16.5% this quarter compared to 15.2% last year. Our expectation for this business for the fullfiscal year of 2018 remain unchanged, which is low single-digit organic sales growth and segment profit in the mid- to high teens as a percentageof sales. We expect to continue to invest in R&D, and our efficiency activities in our facilities and throughout our SG&A structure should continueto provide benefits that will more than offset our investment in innovation.     Moving along to Slide #14, you'll find our Workplace Safety review. Sales increased by 5.6%, which consisted of organic sales decline of 0.5% andan increase from foreign currency translation of 6.1%.     In fact, if you exclude the impact of our small local business that we sold in June of 2017, organic sales would have been slightly positive for theWorkplace Safety division in Q2.     Sales growth continued to be led by our European business, which makes up 50% of total WPS revenue. This business continued streak of organicsales growth by posting low single-digit growth in the quarter. Online sales continues to be the driver of growth in the region, and we saw highsingle-digit growth again this quarter. The European team is identifying new sales opportunities while expertly managing the catalog to digitalshift that's been underway for several years.     Pricing pressures impact the European business just as it did to the U.S. business, but these challenges are more than offset by efficiency andimprovements in our SG&A cost structure in this business.     Our Australian business increased organic sales on low single digits while adding solid profit improvements as well. The team is identifying newsales opportunities and growing sales with existing customers. We're gaining momentum in Australia, we're executing our strategy, and we'redelivering consistently improved financial results.     Our North American business is turning the corner as the rate of sales decline is low -- in the low single digits compared to last year. Our averageorder size continues to increase. We're gaining momentum that we expect to continue throughout the back half of this fiscal year. We continue toface pricing pressures, which are compressing margins in our less proprietary product offerings, but our strategy in this business is to focus ourenergy on our proprietary product offerings and our custom capability, both of which are our strengths.     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

We're continuing to take action toimprove the WPS business' organic sales growth through 3 priorities. First, we're working to improve the buying experience for our customers sothat it is simple as possible, reaching our customers in a way they would like to be reached, whether it's online, mobile, catalog or in person, isessential to gain market share and grow this business.     Second, we're increasing our customer interaction to provide more value than simply filling orders. This allows us to understand what our customersare dealing with from a safety and identification standpoint, and to better serve those needs by offering our compliance expertise and completesolutions.     Third, one of our strengths is our ability to customize and quickly turn orders around to our customers. So we're improving our portfolio of productsby introducing more customized and proprietary products that our customers need while providing them with our extensive safety and complianceexpertise.     Segment profit in the WPS business was $7.1 million compared to $6.1 million in last year's second quarter, an increase of 16.4%.     As a percentage of sales, segment profit was 8.7% this quarter compared to 7.9% in last year's second quarter. We continue to address our coststructure throughout the global WPS segment, and we're investing in sales-generating resources while streamlining processes and reducing thecost of previous orders at the same time. These are the drivers of our improved financial results this quarter.     Our expectations for WPS financial performance for the full year are unchanged. We expect organic sales to be approximately flat, and that segmentprofit will continue to be in the high single digits as a percentage of sales.     I'm proud of what we've accomplished halfway through fiscal 2018. We're off to a good start, and we're gaining momentum. We've delivered 3straight quarters of organic sales growth and 10 straight quarters of pretax profit growth, and we're capitalizing on new opportunities every singleday. That's a trend.     But we have more work to do. We need to keep improving on underperforming businesses, and we need to invest in selling and R&D resources,while at the same time driving operational excellence throughout Brady. We believe we will continue to face pricing pressures in both our WPSand our health care product lines in IDS, which makes our investments in innovation and new products all more important to our long-term success.     We continue to push decision-making further into the company, and the impact of this culture shift is apparent in our financial results, reducingcomplexity in our global structure, and we're moving barriers so that our local managers can think, decide and act on their feet on a daily basis hasbeen empowering and motivating for the team.     We're constantly working to identify and eliminate nonvalue activities that are not part of designing a product, making a product or serving ourcustomers. We're directly in support of those efforts.     I'm proud of our results halfway through fiscal 2018, but we're not letting up as an organization. I'm motivated to push for more, and I know thatthe entire Brady team is motivated and excited for what the future will bring. I know that we can exceed our goals and continue to deliver whatwe've promised to our customers, our employees and our shareholders.     I'd now like to start the Q&A.

We definitely feel strongly that we are putting in place the right type of new product development tocontinue our growth curve. I believe that we've actually spoken about GDP plus 2, not x2, rates of growth in that business. But that doesn't meanthat we aren't optimistic at all. To the contrary, we believe that the economy is getting stronger and that we have the products to take advantageof that and continue to grow at a rate above GDP."

And I asked the question regarding the balance sheet last quarter. You guys continue to sort of maintain sort of this discipline/patientmentality. Just wondering, the balance sheet continues to improve, cash flow, as you noted in your commentary, it looks like it's going to continueto trend really well, so the balance sheet should continue to improve. Your operating have sort of an insufficient -- or inefficient capital structure.Just wondering if there's any update regarding your thinking on the balance sheet?"

We take a look at, first and primarily, reinvestingin the business. And as you can see, we've been reinvesting in the business, and we will continue to do that, whether it's R&D, which -- although alarge portion does hit our bottom line, includes capital and strong capital. Whether it's in our facilities to making it more efficient, whether it's inpurchasing facilities that we believe are key to our long-term future, we are doing more and more of that as we are able, not from a cash perspective,but to make sure that we have the bandwidth and are making wise decisions. In addition, our dividend payouts remain strong, and we remainwilling to acquire stock as it makes sense for the company. As far as using cash in other ways such as acquisitions, although we absolutely have astrong analysis of this, we are patient. We need to make sure that we're not buying businesses that don't add significantly to the company. I'vealways said that we will keep our commitments. One of the commitments that I stated unequivocally about is if we acquire, we will acquire forsynergistic, technological reasons. In other words, a company must have a technology that we cannot develop in a timely and cost-effective way.We must help that company when we acquire them and they must help us. So we are patient and that does not mean that we don't think that we'lldeploy the capital, we do feel strongly we will. Timing is not one that we will stake because we believe that, that's actually negative to our shareholders'best interest."

And then, Michael, last question for me. It's been a few years now since you've been working on improving the productivity of the company,efficiencies, trying to get SG&A as a percent of sales down. Just wondering, looking back to what you've done and looking at the company today,how much room do you think that there's improvement? I mean, SG&A still in a fairly high as a percent of sales, so just wondering, looking 1 yearor 2 ahead, in terms of productivity and sort of just the overall cost structure of the company, how much more improvement do you think there'spossible?"

Michael Nauman,Brady Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",True,False,"Well, I'd like to say, intrinsically, we do have a business that does require more SG&A, and that we are small volume, high mix, proprietary niches.That said, I feel strongly that we have excellent opportunities to continue to improve our SG&A structure. One of the mantras I've always used islower the water, you'll see the rocks. And really, the entire corporation has bought into that as they see more opportunities. I'll just -- I'll give youa great example that isn't directly related to SG&A, but it is a very visual. I went to one of our major facilities and challenge them with an audaciousamount of space that they would have to open up. And the head of the operations literally said 6 months later that he thought I was insane.     10     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

If we literally just take a look at what we see today, ourpeople often aren't seeing all of the opportunities, but if we continue to improve, we're seeing more and more opportunities. There are a lot ofthings that we're working on today. I know our organization never even thought it was possible just a year-plus ago. So I'm very confident we cancontinue to do it. I have line of sight. Our team leaders have line of sight. Our managers have line of sight on specific actions we're taking to continuethe path. So I definitely feel as good about that as I did when we started it."

You commented on the FX impact on SG&A. Was there an impact on the -- at the segment level on the operatingincome of those segments or at the gross margin level for the Corporation?

From a gross margin percentage perspective, it was very negligible. So we're still at the 49.9%.And if you start -- if you break it down further and you look at it by each of the 2 divisions, ID Solutions as a percentage, it was relatively negligibleas well. Now our Workplace Safety business does have a much higher percentage of overseas business than ID Solutions, so they did see a slightimprovement in their operating profit as a percent of sales, but it was very slight."

Can you quantify -- I guess what I'm trying to understand what the headwind is on pricing? And does the new product development-- is that helping you counteract some of that -- from legacy products? Or is it just -- the pricing as a whole across the board is just pretty tough,even with the new product."
23,64388528,BRADY CORP.,02/22/2018," 3:30PM, BRC",Q2 2018 Brady Corp Earnings Call,J. Michael Nauman,Brady Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",True,False,"Well, we can -- we need to bifurcate that between the 2 areas that we're seeing the biggest challenge, Charley. One is WPS Americas and the otheris our health care portion of IDS. And the drivers for those are different. In WPS Americas, you're effectively looking at a less opaque pricing structurein the marketplace. And so that does create more challenges. That said, by driving more proprietary products, by really providing complete solutions,we're giving our customers things that other companies really aren't and can't do. That result means we can overcome that. But obviously, on theone-off in the more commoditized space, that pricing pressure is stronger. Now let's flip over to IDS and the health care space, what you're lookingup there is a consolidation of buying groups. you're looking at consolidation of health care providers. Whenever you see that, the leverage thatthey can maintain over pricing is higher than before. And as a result of that, with our less proprietary products, we, once again, are facing more ofa challenge. In this case, once again, by creating unique proprietary products that we're pretty excited about, that actually not only add value butoften create a price point that's exciting for the hospital in addition, and yet give us greater total revenue at better margins. It's a win-win for bothour customer base, the buying groups and Brady overall. So yes, developing these proprietary products and the type of products we're doing doeshave a definite positive impact in overcoming that.     11     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Although we don't break out the actual mix, I will tell you that we've spoken about thepercentage, I believe, Aaron, of manufacturing, which is about 50%. We are planning to move that up. We see, in the longer term, being able toget another 20% out of that. We, obviously, do want to maintain a healthy portfolio of products that we don't necessarily have expertise to developand manufacture to provide complete solutions, but we are uniquely positioned in our space to really provide most of the solutions ourself. It hasbeen fascinating as we've been really working on both new products and looking at the products we make at the ability of the group to seedifferently how they should be positioned and how that -- what they should manufacture and what they shown. So we're confident we're goingto move ahead, as I said, to those numbers. And more importantly though, as we add that percentage, more of those products will be ones thatare truly differentiating to the Brady organization and WPS specifically."

But as I mentioned in my earlier statement about challenging one of our larger facilitiesto open up audacious amounts of space, one of the things that the leader of that group has done is in the middle of that space, which is significant,put signs and said, this space reserved for future manufacturing and sales. So yes, we have the capacity, we have, in many cases, the equipment,and so we can leverage this quite effectively, I believe. Now as we manufacture new products, we are investing in significant equipment, automatedequipment, state-of-the-art capabilities as well, to manufacture those products that we weren't manufacturing before but are clearly within ourtechnology wheelhouse I know we should have been.     12     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Now, we are literally seeing our numbers plus inall of our products that we're developing. So we have a much more robust process in bringing to market. And our pipeline is much stronger forthe future. So you will be seeing in this year and coming forward more products executing more effectively and driving more sales, yes.

When you look at your commodity-like product offering at WPS, specifically in the U.S., have youstarted to see any sort of slowdown in the headwinds that you've seen in the trends there? Or is that just sort of consistently continuing at a certainrate?"

Michael Nauman,Brady Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",True,False,"Well, I'd like to say a couple of things. One in our commodity products, in many cases, we've eliminated some that just don't make sense in ourportfolio, actually, to the extent, over the last couple of years, of tens of millions of dollars in revenue. So what you're seeing as results are net ofus eliminating a lot of products that absolutely didn't make any sense. So to that point, without question, we're seeing less headwinds. If there wasa product that was commoditized that we really shouldn't have been selling, we aren't selling it anymore. And therefore, we're not literally tryingto roll upstream. But in general, because we are moving more to customize in proprietary, we're able to include those products as total packagesets. And the end result of that total package set is less -- a less pressure on pricing. But the final issue is, I do think we're seeing more stabilizationin the base value of those commodity products as well. But we don't expect to see that go away entirely."
