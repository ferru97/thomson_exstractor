2,64389974,BIOMARIN PHARMACEUTICALS INC,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, BMRN",Q4 2017 Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc Earnings Call,Jean,Jacques Bienaim�,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,False,True,"Thank you, Traci. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. So 2017 was a momentous year for BioMarin driven by significant financial,regulatory and clinical achievements. For the full year 2017, revenues topped $1.3 billion, which is an increase of 18% compared to 2016.     We received U.S. and EU approvals for Brineura for the treatment of CLN2 in less than 4 years from the first patient being treated with our product.As a result of that approval, we received a pediatric Priority Review Voucher, which we sold for more than half of Brineura's development cost.Including safety and efficacy data from our Phase I/II study with gene therapy product, valoctocogene roxaparvovec or valrox, for the treatmentof severe Hemophilia A resulted in the launch of 2 separate Phase III studies, one of which started last December and the other one will start earlythis year.     Normally, I have authority supportive of the program. We received both prime and breakthrough designations. The patient community is veryenthusiastic about valrox, the notion of a potentially one-and-done treatment option for a patient community who dealt in the past with frequentjoint bleeds and the need to always have access to rescue medications even in the face of taking multiple weekly infusions of recombinant factorVIII was inconceivable before gene therapy.     Momentum is definitely building in this area of development in hemophilia, and we are thrilled to be at the forefront. Hank will provide additionalupdates on valrox and our earlier stage programs shortly.     Turning to our other late-stage development program, pegvaliase and visoritide, both of which progressed as expected over the year. At R&D Daylast October, we shared data with visoritide in achondroplasia demonstrating consistent durability and safety over 30 months in our Phase I/IIsubjects. The global Phase III program continues to enroll as planned, and we anticipate completion mid-year.     The BLA for our next potential commercial product, pegvaliase, was filed last June and we look forward to the PDUFA outcome in late May. ThePKU market represents a significant opportunity as we have seen with Kuvan. And Jeff will walk us through his plans and our plans for the launchand execution of commercial pegvaliase in the U.S. in a moment.     Looking forward to 2018, double digit growth of revenue should continue, with total revenue expected to be between $1.47 billion to $1.53 billion,representing growth of between 15% to 19% compared to 2017 results.     In 2017, we reached non-GAAP income of $74 million for the year. And in 2018, we expect to improve upon those results to a range of $100 millionto $140 million in non-GAAP income, a 62% improvement from the midpoint.     In the years to come, we intend to steadily increase bottom line results, while continuing to reinvest in our pipeline.     In summary, 2017 was not only our 20th anniversary year, but also one of our most productive to date. As I have just reviewed our accomplishmentsin 2017, I've laid the foundation for even greater productivity and execution in 2018 across the clinical regulatory and commercial pipelines.     Now I will now turn the call over to Jeff who will review the Commercial business in more details.

3,64389974,BIOMARIN PHARMACEUTICALS INC,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, BMRN",Q4 2017 Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc Earnings Call,Jeffrey Robert Ajer,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer,False,True,"Thank you, J.J. We delivered record results of sales in 2017 and I'm very pleased with total BioMarin revenues for full year 2017 exceeding theprevious year by 18% and breaking the $1.3 billion mark for the first time.     Starting with Vimizim. Patients on commercial therapy grew 20% in 2017, as well as a continued rise in identified patients increasing to over 2,000worldwide. With only roughly half of the currently identified patients on commercial therapy and the fact that we continue to identify new patients,there is opportunity for significant continued growth from here.     Vimizim net product revenues were $114 million in the fourth quarter and $413 million for the full year, increases of 22% and 17%, respectively,compared to the same periods in 2016.     Last quarter, we had communicated risks associated with order patterns in Brazil. I'm glad to report that the fourth quarter reflected positiveordering from Brazil, but we remain cautious on Brazil quarter-to-quarter in 2018 due to anticipated uneven buying patterns. Other areas of strengthin the fourth quarter included the EUMEA region, with Turkey in particular, Colombia in Latin America and North America.     Looking towards full year 2018 Vimizim guidance, we expect continued revenue growth of between $460 million and $500 million in full yearrevenues.     Moving on to Naglazyme. Net product revenues were $94 million in the quarter and $332 million for the full year, increases of 25% and 12%,respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. Significantly, the number of commercial patients increased by 6% in 2017, an indicator of thecontinued growth and underlying demand for Naglazyme.     Consistent with Vimizim results, Naglazyme sales benefited from an uptick in Brazilian orders in the fourth quarter. As a result, we remain cautiouslyoptimistic that sales in Brazil will be steady in 2018, but also anticipate uneven buying patterns quarter-to-quarter. Our Naglazyme guidance forfull year 2018 net product revenues is between $325 million and $355 million.     Now onto Kuvan. 2017 represented the second full year of global sales of Kuvan by BioMarin since the acquisition of the PKU franchise at internationalmarkets for Merck Serono and we are very pleased with the results. Kuvan net products revenue contributed over $107 million to the top line inthe fourth quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year. For the full year, Kuvan net product revenue was $408 million, a 17% increase over 2016.     North American sales were paced by an increase of 7% in commercial patients year-over-year. The combination of strong results in North America,combined with solid uptake internationally, gives us confidence in providing full year 2018 guidance of between $440 million and $480 million,an increase of about 13% over 2017 results.     Turning now to Brineura, which was approved in both the U.S. and EU in 2017. As we said when we got approval, the commercial strategy forBrineura is different than for our typical ERT products. Our primary focus is on raising awareness among physicians to facilitate early diagnosis. Thegoal is to have patients screened and diagnosed early, while they retain good function and are good candidates for treatment, and that will continueto be our focus going forward.     The initial Brineura launch is rolling out as anticipated. We are seeing a gradual steady ramp of new countries and additional sites for payer toprovide treatment and as a result, patients are being transitioned to receive commercial Brineura. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, we hadover 40 commercial patients worldwide, spanning 7 countries and 22 treatment sites.     We continue to expect to have about 40 sites equipped to provide treatment with Brineura by mid this year. Our efforts to raise awareness ofBrineura and the importance of the early diagnosis is progressing nicely.     The number of physicians experienced in Brineura is expanding and driving interest in the communities. We have learned a few things over thefirst few quarters of launch, including that new site readiness can take longer than expected due to the complexity of multidisciplinary preparation     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

However, we view this as part of the process given the uniqueness of Brineura and believe we are on track to manage any challengesrelated to the complexity of planning port surgery and infusions.     The early diagnosis programs we have put in place are gaining momentum. 100 institutions across the U.S. have participated to date in our Behindthe Seizure program, resulting in several children with CLN2 being diagnosed through that program. In Europe where we are navigating throughcountry-by-country reimbursement, we are on track and expect steady progress throughout 2018. We are very pleased with the pace of the launchtoday and expect growing awareness of Brineura in the physician and CLN2 community. As a result, we expect solid revenue growth in 2018,resulting in full year guidance of between $35 million and $55 million.     Finally, now turning to pegvaliase for which we expect to learn U.S. approval status in late May. We are cautiously optimistic that a U.S. commerciallaunch will be under way in the second half of this year.     As we have communicated, upon the potential approval of pegvaliase, we will take a slow-and-go approach to the commercial launch. We havelearned over the course of developing pegvaliase that patients respond at varying rates, so we plan to take additional time upfront during theinduction and titration phase of treatment to get it right and keep patients on therapy up to and through the maintenance phase of treatment.     The feedback we've gotten from the over 200 patients currently in our clinical studies is that working through the first phase of treatment is worththe time and effort to get to maintenance therapy.     We appreciate the many of you who are interested in knowing more about how we are thinking about pricing pegvaliase, so I would like to sharethe following. The specifics of pricing will be available upon approval, but we do expect to price pegvaliase at a modest premium to the averageprice from an adult Kuvan patient, currently about $150,000 annually, net.     Further, during the initial induction titration phase of treatment, we would expect revenue to be fractional and then transition to full pricing oncemaintenance dosing has been achieved. We're very excited about the opportunity with pegvaliase as it will be a significant component of our PKUfranchise.     In the U.S., we expect pegvaliase will be the approved treatment of choice for adults, complementing Kuvan, which is and will continue to betreatment of choice for children.     Pegvaliase has proven to be highly efficacious in severe PKU adults resulting in significant reductions of phenylalanine. We believe the market isexcited about the approval of pegvaliase and that there's a lot of interest in gaining access once it is approved.     We have years of experience working directly with the 35 clinical trial sites in the U.S. of the 125 total PKU clinics in the U.S. and, therefore, anticipatehitting the ground running in product approval. As was the case with Brineura, we do not provide guidance -- revenue guidance in an approvaland launch year, so we look forward to keeping you apprised with our progress with pegvaliase following the outcome of our late May PDUFA.     And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to provide more detail on the fourth quarter and full year financial results. Dan?"

Spiegelman,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,Executive VP & CFO,False,True,"Thanks, Jeff. Please see today's press release summarizing our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2017. Since Jeff alreadyreviewed 2017 revenue results and provided detailed 2018 revenue guidance, I will cover other 2017 result items and then provide our 2018 andlonger term financial guidance.     Two key Q4 items to point out: first is the sale of the Priority Review Voucher for $125 million. The proceeds are classified as a gain on sale of anintangible asset in operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Associated with the sale, there is also a provision for taxexpense of approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter results were also impacted by charges associated with the Tax Reform     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

First is a $42 million charge directly related to revaluation of our deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the federal rate from 35% to 21%and due to additional limitations on tax deductible compensation.     In addition, the company established a $41 million valuation allowance related to State of California tax credits. Based on increased incentives inthe Tax Reform Act to conduct R&D in the United States, we now project that for the foreseeable future, we will generate more State of Californiatax credits than we will utilize on an annual basis and, hence, the need for a valuation allowance and expense in this quarter against our existingCalifornia credits.     From the bottom line standpoint, results for the full year of 2017, GAAP net loss for the year was $117 million and non-GAAP income for the fullyear was $74 million.     We ended the year with $1.78 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Major inflows for the year included $482 million from the issuanceof convertible notes and $125 million from the sale of the PRV.     Major uses of cash included gross capital expenditures for the year of just under $200 million, driven by the construction of our new gene therapymanufacturing facility, finished build-out of our manufacturing facility in Shanbally to support commercial supply of Vimizim, plus some officefacilities in Novato and San Rafael. In addition, investment in inventory increased by $125 million due to the new approval of Brineura and increasedVimizim and Kuvan revenues.     Before reviewing 2018 guidance, let me remind you of the long-term guidance and financial plan that we laid out at the end of 2016. Specifically,we have previously said and reiterate today that starting in 2017 and through the end of the decade, we expect revenues from our approvedproducts plus pegvaliase to grow 15% per year and then for revenue growth to accelerate above that level with visoritide and valrox.     With respect to operating expenses, we have guided that they will generally grow on an absolute dollar basis, but at a lower rate than revenuegrowth, creating incremental operating margin and bottom line expansion through the end of the decade and then acceleration of profit growthafter that.     In addition to reiterating our long-term guidance, our 2018 guidance today is consistent with that plan. So turning now to 2018.     2018 total revenue guidance is between $1.47 billion and $1.53 billion. To help analyze this compared to 2017 total revenues, excluding the one-timeSarepta upfront payment, our 2018 revenue guidance represents revenue growth of between 15% and 19%. I would note that this 2018 revenueforecast assumes that key currencies remain at the current exchange rates through the year. In addition, our revenue guidance does assume thelaunch of pegvaliase in the United States in the second half of 2018, but we believe we can achieve revenues in this guidance range even withoutpegvaliase.     From a bottom line perspective, our GAAP net loss guidance for 2018 is $115 million to $165 million, and our benchmark of non-GAAP incomeguidance is $100 million to $140 million, and an improvement at the midpoint over 2017 non-GAAP results of 62%.     Our R&D spend guidance for 2018 is between $645 million and $685 million is driven by both visoritide and valrox Phase III being in full swing in2018 compared to a relatively light clinical spend year in 2017.     SG&A guidance for 2018 of between $575 million and $615 million is driven by the planned launch of pegvaliase, the continued launch of Brineuraand continued efforts on the growth of Vimizim and Kuvan.     With our global infrastructure in place, straight G&A spending is basically unchanged year-over-year.     In total, 2018 SG&A and R&D expense guidance shows an increase of between 5% and 11.5% compared to 2018 revenue growth of between 15%and 19%. The one area of margin contraction in 2018 is cost of sales with guidance of between 20% to 21% of revenues, about 200 basis points     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

The main drivers of the 2018 cost of sales rate increase are related to additional production capacity from the Shanballyfacility coming online.     More specifically, the Shanbally, Ireland facility approval results in some nonrecurring charges being recognized in 2018. But more importantly,increased per unit production costs at current volumes. As revenues increase and new products get approved, we will more fully utilize that capacity.And as that capacity gets utilized, we expect the cost of sales line to return to historical levels.     Looking further out, both visoritide and valrox could have substantially improved gross margins, which could drive down our long-term cost ofsales level below our historic levels.     In terms of capital spending, we expect overall capital investment in 2018 to be similar to 2017 and between $160 million and $180 million, primarilyin manufacturing and laboratory facilities. In addition, there will be an approximately $70 million to $90 million investment in additional inventoryto support new product launches and revenue growth.     Finally, please recall that per our prior guidance, we intend to repay the $375 million principal amount of our maturing 2018 bonds in cash, regardlessof whether they mature in the money or not.     Even with these capital and cash outlays, we continue to believe that our existing financial resources mean we won't need to do additional equityor equity-linked financings except in the 3 circumstances we've previously mentioned: potential M&A; refinancing our 2020 or '24 converts; or amajor product setback.     Now I'd like to turn the call over to Hank to provide an update on our development programs. Hank?"
5,64389974,BIOMARIN PHARMACEUTICALS INC,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, BMRN",Q4 2017 Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc Earnings Call,Henry J. Fuchs,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,President of Worldwide Research & Development,False,True,"Thank you, Dan. On the occasion of our year-end results call, I take a moment to reflect on what has been achieved over the last 12 months. I'mproud of the innovativeness and productivity at BioMarin and it's all about alleviating suffering and helping others to live their life to their fullpotential. So before I walk through the numerous accomplishments of the past year, I'd like to think the entire R&D team and the rest of mycolleagues at BioMarin for their continued execution of our mission to get new treatments approved for the people who have come to rely on ourgood work.     Starting with valrox. It is remarkable to reflect on where the program was only a year ago. You may recall, when we started our program, we werehoping to convert patients from severe to mild hemophilia. Last year, we were talking to you about the proof of concept results observed in 2016in which we were going well beyond achieving a milder state of hemophilia. We augmented our plans with the addition of the 4E13 vector genomesper kilo dose, and here we are today having demonstrated positive efficacy and safety data in our Phase I/II program that led to the launch of PhaseIII GENEr8-1 and GENEr8--2 studies, both of which are open for enrollment. Importantly, with the start of these pivotal studies, we're seeing anincrease in the level of enthusiasm for valrox from the patient and physician communities.     At our most recent data update at ASH last December, we were very excited to update results after treatment of patients with the 6E13 vector perkilo -- vector genomes per kilo dose. Most patients have achieved and maintained Factor VIII levels within the normal range in severe hemophiliaA. Further, median annualized bleeding rates and vector use continue to be 0 for both metrics at that time point. We also shared up to 1 year resultswith the 4E13 vector genomes per kilogram dose for 3 patients with the longest follow-up with Factor VIII levels in or near the normal range. Asthe -- as a whole, the 4E13 vector genomes per kilo dose results at that time point, demonstrated sustained Factor VIII levels approaching or withinthe lower end of the normal range for most patients. The 4E13 vector genome per kilo dose subjects also had median annualized bleeding ratesand factor use of 0 as of that time point.     Concurrent with ASH, The New England Journal of Medicine published preliminary results of the ongoing Phase I/II study of valrox. The accompanyingeditorial titled, ""A Cure for Hemophilia within Reach,"" highlighted the tremendous need for better therapy for patients because of the residual riskof bleeding, the high cost of prophylactic therapy and the demanding nature of intermittent factor replacement. The editorial also established an     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

As a leader in this field, we're committed to enabling valrox to do as much as possible for patients. Of immediate consequence, the next steps forthe program are to continue enrollment of the Phase III studies and provide an update on the Phase I/II study around midyear, so stay tuned.     Enthusiasm for participation by sites and patients is very high. We don't think patient interest will in any way limit enrollment in the 2 studies. The6E13 dose by year end and the 4E13 dose shortly thereafter.     Turning to our gene therapy facility. It's completely built-out and we expect to have commercial scale material ready for use in the pivotal studyat the end of April. It has the capacity to supply between 2,000 and 3,000 6E13 vector genomes per kilo patients annually. We believe this capabilityfurther increases BioMarin's lead in the field compared to any other company developing a gene therapy product for severe hemophilia A.     Moving on to visoritide for children with achondroplasia. At R&D Day last October, we showed durable growth velocity, sustained throughout [20](inaudible) 30 months of treatment using the 15-microgram per kilo dose. In addition, we shared data supporting expectations for continuedgrowth based on lead indicators and for potential improvement in other complications from the condition, such as spinal cord compression, [rimand magnum] compressions, sleep apnea, disproportionality and daily activities that many of us take for granted.     Specifically, over the 30-month observation periods, patients experienced mean absolute growth increase of approximately 4 centimeters overwhat their baseline growth velocity would have predicted. In addition, treatment with visoritide demonstrated continued improvement over timein proportionality as measured by a ratio of upper and lower body measurements, or the U/L ratio, as part of the 30-month update.     Our feeder study, which establishes baseline growth rate prior to treatment, is now fully enrolled, reflecting the high degree of interest in thepatient community internationally and in the U.S. in particular. The treatment study continues to enroll with anticipated completion in mid-2018and top line data in the second half of 2019.     As we also announced in the first half of this year, we anticipate enrollment to commence in our infant-toddler study, supporting our belief thatin this indication in particular, the earlier treatment begins, the more benefit patients are expected to derive.     We also let you know in January that we expected the FDA to hold a meeting to discuss achondroplasia given the unmet need for those who areinterested in treatment and the fact that no approved therapy exists in this pediatric indication. The meeting has been noticed in the FederalRegister and is planned for March 22 of this year where those of us in the development community as well as patients, key opinion leaders andadvocates, will have the opportunity to collaborate on establishing standards for drug development in achondroplasia. We look forward toparticipating in this meeting with the goal of establishing high standards for clinical study design and endpoints just to name a couple of keymatters.     Turning now to our most recently updated data for our newest program, BMN 250, enzyme replacement therapy, for the treatment of MPS IIIB, arapid and progressive neurodegenerative disease of young children. At the World Medical Meeting (sic) [WORLDSymposium] 2 weeks ago, weupdated results from both the dose escalation portion of the study part 1 and from part 2, which included patients that rolled over from the doseescalation part. We're pleased to share that subjects in both parts of the study demonstrated cerebrospinal fluid glycosaminoglycan levels in thenormal range, as well as spleen and liver size reduction. In subjects who are rolled over the part 2 of the study, development quotient or DQ, istrending in the right direction. We're very excited about the early results of this program, especially in light of the success we've experienced withintracerebral ventricular delivery modality based on our Brineura patients. We expect to complete the feeder portion of the study where we trackdevelopment quotient for the first 12 months of enrollment and close enrollment in this quarter of 2018.     We expect to have 1 year [deep] baseline data in the first quarter of 2019, so stay tuned for additional updates as the program progresses.     And finally, as J.J. mentioned, we look forward to the Prescription Drug User Fee Action date at the end of May for pegvaliase. We're confident inthe fee lowering properties of pegvaliase, so we're hopeful that the immune response data are acceptable for an approval.

Is that the 1-year DQ data you've just mentioned? And then I guess on that front, what doyou hope to see on that side to move forward? Is stabilization of DQ enough or you need improvement, too?

So in the context of Brineura, 48 weeks by itself was enough. I -- we don't know about the efficacy of thefull cohort of patients at 48 weeks, so that's why it's premature to speculate. But what I'd say is, is that based on Brineura, we have made substantialimprovements in the 250 programs. Specifically, we're using the same exact tool to measure outcome in a natural history context as in the treatmentcontext. We're measuring those development quotient improvements in the same patients, not different patients. Those were -- that was a bigpart of the Brineura review and we've eliminated that as a concern for the 250 application. In addition, unlike Brineura, in the case of 250, there'sa very good biomarker for biological activity of the product. And finally, unlike with Brineura where there were no systemic manifestations of thedisease to follow, we've already demonstrated normalization of liver size, which I'll remind you, has been a basis of approval for other enzymereplacement therapies. So we're cautiously optimistic about the progress we've made with 250. I think that we're ahead of where we were at asimilar time in the case of Brineura and as to kind of what magnitude of improvement would trigger either another study or an application, I thinkit's a matter of stay tuned."

And then on the commercial front, assuming that pegvaliase is, indeed, approved in May, I can appreciate the slow and steadyinitial launch curve, but how should we be thinking about some of the headwinds and tailwinds for this product? What do you see as the biggestneedle movers there that we should be thinking about?"

We have over 200 clinical trial patients, a majority of which we would expect to be able to transition to commercial during the course of theyear, assuming an approval date on or around our PDUFA. So that's a tailwind. For na�ve to treatment patients, we have to get through the inductionand titration phase. That would be something like a 12- to 24-week period on average, but also noting that some patients have taken longer than24 weeks to reach a maintenance phase. During that period of time, patients will be taking a variety of doses. So we've got 3 prefilled syringe SKUs,we would anticipate a 2.5-microgram, a 10-microgram and a 20-microgram dose. And so depending on the dosing schedule, there would befractional revenues during the induction titration phase, starting out at 1 syringe per week early in the induction and titration phase. So onlyfractional revenue during induction and titration. And that would eat up the majority of the calendar year of 2018 for na�ve to treatment patients.So if you consider that to be a bit of a headwind. In terms of new patient enrollment, 35 of the 125 PKU clinics in the United States have experienceusing pegvaliase through the clinical trial program. So that gives us a good base of experience to start off from. And we know that those investigatorsare interested in trialing new patients when pegvaliase is approved. We also know that they've guided that they would start patients in relativelysmall batches. Think several -- or several-ish. Work them up through the initial induction and titration phase to something approaching maintenancedosing and then starting the next batch of patients and so on. So that will be kind of a measured pace of new patient introduction of the pegvaliase.And then for the about 90 PKU clinics in the United States that don't have experience through the clinical trial program, we have the usual educationprocess to get through before we would anticipate they would trial patients. We would anticipate and, in fact, guide those clinics to start withseveral-ish patients, be very deliberate about having good experiences, good initial experiences with pegvaliase and then starting additionalpatients. So it will be a measured start throughout 2018."

Just first, I'm curious on the decision to wait on starting a pediatric program until there'san approval in adults. I think you guys have said that for a while. Can you maybe clarify, is this driven by FDA's direction or is this your decision?And I guess, the reason I'm asking is it's kind of striking with today's announcement that you're starting an infant study for visoritide, sort of whynot apply maybe the same logic to pegvaliase? And then maybe on the commercial side, I was struck by your comments that revenue for titrationpatients would be fractional. I thought I heard you guys say earlier that you would not be pricing this on a per milligram basis and rather by SKUs.Can you maybe give a little bit more color? Should we think about it in terms of the amount of drug? Or is there some other measure?"

19,64389974,BIOMARIN PHARMACEUTICALS INC,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, BMRN",Q4 2017 Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc Earnings Call,Henry J. Fuchs,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,President of Worldwide Research & Development,True,False,"Sure, thanks, Chris. The considerations with pegvaliase has all along been -- it's a foreign protein that's PEGylated within an elicited immuneresponse. We really wanted to build a good safety database before going into children. And that is an especially important consideration in thecontext in which there is an alternative form of therapy for children, namely medical and nutritional therapy. And that's different -- that's one aspectthat's different from our other indications and another -- and therefore, sort of the ongoing accrual of damage is blunted in PKU as compared withour other enzyme replacement therapy business. So I think those things, those 2 things combined, the nature of the product and wanting to builda really strong safety database as well as the availability of medical and nutritional, the compliance with medical and nutritional therapy, which ishigher in children than it is in adults, suggests to us to take a more measured approach with these children. Now upon regulatory action, clearly,that can be revisited.     And Chris, on the subject of why the fractional revenue during the induction and titration phase. Thinking about pegvaliase patients in a maintenancesetting where they would likely be receiving either 20-milligram or 40-milligram per day maintenance dosing, we would be pricing principally onexpectations of how to price for maintenance dosing. I mentioned earlier that we're anticipating that we would have 3 different prefilled syringeSKUs, 2.5-milligram syringe, 10-milligram syringe and 20-milligram syringe. In the United States, the most likely method of pricing pegvaliase wouldbe either pricing on a per milligram basis or pricing on a per syringe basis. In the maintenance space dose setting, imagine a 20-milligram per daypatient receiving 1 20-milligram syringe per day. In an induction and titration phase, same patient would be starting out at 1 2.5-milligram syringe,once a week, and the frequency of that syringe use increasing, getting to the point of switching to a 10-milligram syringe and then all the way upto a daily dose of 20-milligram in this case. So whether we price on a per syringe basis or a per milligram basis, during the induction and titrationphase, the patients would be getting a fractional price essentially during that period. And that fractional piece would be shifting from very low inthe range initially to higher in the range as they get further through the induction of the titration process."

I think, thank you, Hank. A couple of the things that I think will be impactful in year 1 for the na�ve to experience clinics are, one, what we wouldanticipate is a kind of a guidelines document to be published shortly after pegvaliase approval. We'll receive it at the end of May. That would beone piece. And that the second piece would be to find kind of peer-to-peer opportunities to leverage the experience of the clinical trial investigatorsto share with their non-experienced peers some tips and guidance on working through their initial patients. In terms of the induction and titrationphase, the maintenance and the notion of starting several patients, several [LISH] patients, getting them through the induction-titration phasebefore starting additional patients, what we've heard the clinical trial investigators say is that, it's exactly the 12- to 24-week period that is normalfor induction and titration, that is the most intensive period for them to be managing dose adjustments, potential adverse events, that sort of thing.Once they get through those, the dose adjustments and period where adverse events are most likely to occur, then the workload on those patientsgoes down significantly.

At the R&D Day that you held last year, I think Dr. Cleary presented a naturalhistory data on about 20 patients. I'm curious.

It seems likethat the robust natural history data that you had was important to getting Brineura approved. So I'm curious. How robust is the package that youhave in MPS IIIB?"

And the reasons for that are -- and if you're -- if you go back to the Brineura review,we were talking about where is the FDA's focus? And we had said comparability of endpoints and comparability of patients. And that was drivenby the fact that the patients in the control setting were different patients than the patients in the treatment setting. And those control patientswere assessed using a set of tools that were developed by an academic, whereas the tools that we used were more drug industry appropriate tools-- similar conceptually, but not literally the same. In contrast, we are generating a roughly comparably-sized natural history data set, but in thiscase with 250, we're using the same tools for natural history as for treatment. And now the tools will be -- the evaluations will be in the same patientsbefore treatment and after treatment. So we think that the actual natural history database that we're building, and again, it depends on themagnitude of treatment benefit, will be actually quite robust for interpretation of treatment benefit signals."

Now obviously, that's all preclinical work and theessential clinical question will be whether we can establish a positive therapeutic index, that is to say, frataxin upregulation without accompanyingmild suppression. We're cautiously optimistic based on our preclinical data that we can do that, but human clinical experiments will be requiredto demonstrate that. Now one of the other important points to make here is that because the upregulation of frataxin is specific to the diseaseallele, this can only be done in diseased patients.

So stay tuned for further updates there. But just to remind you, we're going to completeenrollment in the natural history cohort in the first quarter of '18. Those patients will be followed for a year through '19. They'll roll over onto atreatment starting in the first quarter -- the end of the enrollment -- in the treated patients will be in the first quarter of '19. Those patients will takea year of treatment and that's why I got 2020 for the first signal, the sort of the first comprehensive signal of activity data from the initial treatmentcohort. So stay tuned. Relative to your question about Brineura ex-U. S. reimbursement. I think we've noted before that the -- of the 40...     (technical difficulty)     Of the 40 or more patients on commercial therapy at the end of 2017, many of those were located in approximately 6 ex-U. S. commercial markets:2 in Latin America; 4 in Europe. And the reimbursement for those patients is on a named patient or named patient-like basis, while we navigatethe full reimbursement and price approval process that we have to get through in most markets. The commercial patients in Europe would becoming from each of Germany, France, Italy and the U.K. And in each of those markets, you know there's varied prescribed set of activities thatsponsors need to get through to attain reimbursement approvals and a price level. We are in the midst of navigating that system right now andwe anticipate getting through that process in those key markets and other markets during the course of 2018. And we think that having navigatedthat system and attaining full price and reimbursement status in certain markets will allow patients easier access to commercial Brineura therapyrelative to the named patient or named patient like approvals that have been attained so far."

In the United States, some of the models that have been discussed, which might include payment over time, paymentfor positive results, something like a rebate for patients that don't respond adequately, those models are going to be challenging to implementunless they're -- until the problem of how to account for government price calculations is solved for. There may be solutions for that, but that's abarrier to implementing those kinds of programs in the United States. And outside of the United States, in single-payer like models, those kind ofreimbursement models are probably easier to navigate and impossible to implement.

As you know, from a manufacturing standpoint,actually the initial commercial scaling manufacturing plant is done. We've talked about being able to handle 2,000 to 3,000 patients a year out ofthat facility. There are things we could potentially do to even expand that and for additional demand we can to construct capacity either here orelsewhere.

I would say our appetite for large transformational deal isrelatively low at this time -- that could change -- but however, we are always interested in earlier stage opportunities that would be strategicallycoherent with our overall strategy of continuing to develop first-in-class or best-in-class products for rare genetic disorders. I mean, obviously,because of the size of the company now, we are achieving $1.5 billion of revenues this year, I would say, unlikely we will move much or continueto -- or develop products for ultra or ultra-orphan or very, very small patient population.

But we don't want to make the mistake that others have made by under-dosing and, therefore, giving toolittle efficacy. And then as far as other surrogate parameters reading on main efficacy parameters, the more important of the parameters, clearly,are the clinical efficacy parameters. We saw, in the case of Brineura, for example, quite dramatic effects on stabilization of loss of [ambulation] andprogression of loss of ambulation, for example. And maybe a little less dramatic effects on CSF brain volume. So the good news is that the clinicaloutcome variables were the important ones.

So we want to capture value acrossall 3 of those dimensions. And you're absolutely right. Pricing over time, based on durability of effect, for example, could be an excellent vehiclefor allowing us to do that. In the United States, there are some practical implications to Medicaid pricing reports that manufacturers must do andthat needs to be solved for before some of these more creative programs can be implemented in the United States. A potential solution would beCMS approving so-called demonstration projects or programs that would be submitted by a sponsor like a BioMarin. That could potentially happen.There could be legislative fixes for this on the logic that the original Medicaid legislation that put all these pricing calculations in play in the firstplace was based on a healthcare system that (inaudible) since 30 years ago, but has been overtaken by innovative advancements like gene therapytoday.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division",VP,True,False,"One quick question on pegvaliase. As you look towards launch and speak to payers, what are you hearing with the likely coverage guidelines forpegvaliase and how this could potentially vary by pricing. From what you've heard, are there some payers that might require patient to potentiallyfail (inaudible) or Kuvan if pegvaliase is indeed more costly?"

So we have conducted payer research not surprisingly, in the run-up to our PDUFA date and we've gotten a mix of feedback from payers.Generally speaking, I would say that the payers are comfortable with the notion of lowering phenylalanine levels as an adequate measure ofmanaging PKU. So that's very good for pegvaliase. And payers are very comfortable, obviously, with their reimbursement of Kuvan. So that sets agood baseline also going into the potential approval of a next-generation therapy. Beyond that, in terms of coverage policies, we've gotten a varietyof feedback, but nothing that would be suggestive of kind of hard and strict policies across-the-board of step therapy or failures on Kuvan or thatsort of thing. It's possible, but we could see some of that creep in initial coverage policies, however."
