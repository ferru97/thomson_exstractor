I appreciate all of you for joining us today. Denbury's fourth quarter was a great demonstration of the potential of this unique companyand it feels like we are just getting started.     We generated significant free cash flow and lowered our cost, reaching a 9-year low on G&A. We underspent on capital compared to budget, grewproduction for the second consecutive quarter, grew reserves, had a successful well with our first significant exploitation investment and improvedour balance sheet.     2     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

We are on a path to significant improvement in our debt metrics, with our Q4 annualized EBITDA resulting in a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 4.5x,significantly lower than where we were earlier last year, and we see a path to even further improvement over the next 2 years in a $60 oil priceenvironment.     Slide 5 highlights of our accomplishments in 2017 and our 2018 priorities. You'll note that our high-level priorities are the same. We will continueto build our foundation of execution, seeking to always improve the blocking and tackling of how we do our business.     Part of what makes Denbury special is the diverse opportunity set that exists in our asset base, and we'll continue to pursue ways to turn thatopportunity into tangible value.     Building on the Mission Canyon success, we plan to ramp up our exploitation activities. We also plan to drive incremental value from our surplusCO2 and pipeline capacity continue (technical difficulty) a primary focus on reaching an investment decision for the initial flood at Cedar CreekAnticline in the first half of this year. And we'll continue to drive greater value from our existing fields, something our teams have done very wellover the past years.     We'll continue to build our financial strength. We plan to extend our bank credit facility this year, and Mark will share more on that later. Our Houstonland sale is in progress, and we expect to begin to see results as early as the second quarter. And we'll continue to maintain capital discipline,spending within cash flow and maintaining a high bar on project economics.     And before moving off this slide, I'd like to touch on significant compensation changes we're implementing this year. Many of the changes areboth at the executive and full employee base and reflect both my belief and a strong alignment between pay and performance as well as shareholderfeedback that we gathered over the last year. We feel that they better align compensation with company performance and growing shareholdervalue.     Key elements include a greater focus on project level returns, strengthening of the balance sheet and improving debt metrics as well as a newlong-term incentive award focused on debt adjusted reserves growth per share.     We based our 2018 plan on a $55 oil price. As you see on Slide 7, this allows a capital budget of $300 million to $325 million, which will keep usspending within cash flow. The highlighted activities in this budget are continued development at Bell Creek, developing Phase 6 in the best partof that field, a 7 well Tuscaloosa infill project at the Delhi, continued EOR development at West Yellow Creek and a stepped-up exploitation programwhere we expect to increase spending to the $30 million to $40 million range.     We're planning to build off our 2017 accomplishments to continue production growth in 2018, as you see on Slide 8. 4Q was up about 1% from3Q '17, and we expect full year '18 to be about 3% above '17 at the midpoint of our guidance.     Looking at the table on the left side of the slide, quarter-over-quarter production increased at Delhi, Hastings and Bell Creek. In 2018, we expectproduction to increase in most major fields, including Bell Creek, where we expect a response from the recently completed Phase 5, [CCA,] wherewe'll continue Mission Canyon development throughout the year, Delhi with the Tuscaloosa infill development and Oyster Bayou from our justcompleted recycle facility expansion. Hastings volumes should also increase with a full year benefit of our 2017 redevelopment project. We expectfirst EOR production from West Yellow Creek Field early in the year, and from Grieve around midyear. Completing the picture, we'll also have thebenefit of a full year's ownership in Salt Creek.     The extreme cold weather in the Deep South caused some power outages and impacted our January production, so we started out the year a bitslower than we would've liked. We anticipate that this downtime, combined with scheduled maintenance at Delhi and Heidelberg, could causeour first quarter production to be slightly lower than our fourth quarter level, but this does not affect our guidance for the full year, which wasfinalized taking all of this into account.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

We benefited from a $7million CO2 price adjustment in the fourth quarter that reduced our actual full year LOE to $20.35 per barrel.     Along with our focus on improving execution, our operating teams have done a great job of driving ownership of LOE to the field level, and weare seeing the results in terms of high predictability as well as visibility to make LOE-impacting decisions based on economics as market conditionsevolve. Looking at 2018, we expect most LOE categories to remain flat with '17. Being in different basins for most of the industry and with our corebusiness focused on different activities, insulates us from much of the cost inflation we see across the industry. We do see upward cost pressurein 2 primary categories. The first being power, where utility providers in some of our operating areas have increased their electricity rates; and thesecond is CO2, where higher oil prices will have a CO2 price impact, but we see that as a good thing as it means our overall business is that muchbetter.     Considering these 2 elements, we expect per barrel LOE to increase by around $0.50 per barrel from 2017. A key takeaway on LOE is that ourimproved control and visibility into LOE helps us make conscious, economic choices that generate the most value for the company.     Exploitation will be a greater focus in 2018, and Slide 10 is an overview of the portfolio. What I'd like you to take away from this line is the breadthof the portfolio, underscored by the number of opportunities shown as blue circles on the chart on the right. The scale of the portfolio is significant,at 120 million BOE on an unrisked basis and 50 million BOE on a risk basis, and we're adding to that portfolio every day as our teams continue toidentify new opportunities across our 600,000 net acre leasehold.     The next 3 slides will take you through specific near-term exploitation targets. I won't go into deep detail, but I'd like to give you a flavor for thetypes of opportunities we're currently working.     I mentioned our Mission Canyon success earlier, and I couldn't be more pleased with our first exploitation well here. It was well executed, maintainedin a tight horizontal target window and the production results were strong, with an initial 30-day average rate of 1,050 barrels of oil per day. It wascompleted open hole with no stimulation for a total drill and complete cost at $3.6 million.     We have running room with this horizon at CCA and currently think that we have around 24 additional locations. We have a rig drilling the firstwell on a 2-well pad right now and have a total of 6 Mission Canyon wells planned for 2018.     On the Gulf Coast at Kingsley, we plan to drill a well in the Parise Sand starting around the end of the first quarter. This well targets an unsweptlower perm area of Tinsley, with individual well costs between $3 million or $4 million and good running room for an additional development.     Back up in the Powder River Basin, unconventional development of the Turner, Parkman and Niobrara and Mowry has steadily moved closer toour Hartzog Draw unit where we hold deep rights to around 13,000 net acres. We're planning to drill a well here in the second half of the year totest the prospectivity on our acreage, which is held by Hartzog Draw Unit production and has significant existing infrastructure.     One of our key focus areas for the year is improving our financial strength, and we are taking a deep look at how each of our assets fits in theportfolio. Last year, we disclosed our intent to sell some Houston area acreage, and this process is progressing well. We expect to begin to see bigresults in the second quarter, with partial sales expected to continue throughout 2018.     Separately, we've been taking a hard look at our asset base and the potential for portfolio management opportunities in 2018. I believe it's importantto continually evaluate our assets along their life cycles to determine where best to deploy capital and when to divest of certain assets to upgradethe asset base. With this in mind, we've identified several of our mature oil fields in the Gulf Coast region that we plan to market for sale in the nearfuture. The fields being marketed are those listed in the Mature Area on Slide 8 in the presentation.     And before I hand it over to Mark, I want to emphasize how pleased I am with the performance of our employees. Their grit, creativity and hardwork drove our successes in 2017 and will take us to the next level in 2018.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

3,64388628,DENBURY RESOURCES,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, DNR",Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call,Mark C. Allen,Denbury Resources Inc.,"Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary",False,True,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning. My comments today will highlight some of the financial items in our release, primary focusing on the sequentialchanges from the third quarter, and I will also provide some forward-looking guidance to help you in updating your financial models.     Starting on Slide 15. We are extremely pleased with our financial results this quarter as our continued efforts on cost reductions, efficiency andexecution are starting to shine through.     On an adjusted basis, net income was $48 million for the fourth quarter, up from $14 million in the third quarter, with the increase mostly drivenby higher revenues. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $127 million, with the primary differences being a $78 million adjustment fornoncash mark-to-market commodity derivative changes and a one-time deferred tax benefit of $132 million, reflecting the re-measurement ofdeferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%.     Turning to Slide 16. Our non-GAAP adjusted cash flow from operations, which excludes working capital changes improved to $134 million for thefourth quarter, nearly doubling from the third quarter, again, driven primarily by higher revenues.     Our fourth quarter average realized oil price before hedges were $57 per barrel, a 20% increase from our realized price in the prior quarter. Whenyou include the impact of our hedges, the per barrel realized oil price increased 16% from the prior quarter as our combined revenues and commodityderivative settlements increased by $46 million.     Slide 17 provides a summary of our oil price differentials, which is our average realized oil prices relative to NYMEX prices. Our oil price differentialimproved by over $2 per barrel from last quarter, which on its own equates to an $11 million uplift in revenues.     Our overall differential of a $1.70 above NYMEX prices is the best differential we have realized since the second quarter of 2013. This improvementwas generally related to an expanding premium for light Louisiana sweet oil, which averaged over $5 per barrel above NYMEX prices in Q4, trackingsimilarly to the increase in Brent prices. Approximately 2/3 of our production has an LLS index component included in its price formula. We havealso seen our CCA and Rockies price differential improve to the best levels since we began operations there in 2010.     On the bottom portion of this slide, you can see the movement in the LS premium over the last few years and the LS future's basis differentials forthe remainder of 2018. As you can see, the LS premium has pulled back significantly from recent highs and is trending in the positive $2 to $2.50range.     I'll review our hedging positions on our next slide but as I had mentioned on last quarter's call, we previously took advantage of the opportunitiesto lock in LLS to WTI basis swaps at an average premium above $4 per barrel to the first half of 2018 to capture a portion of this strong premium.     With the LS premium trending down throughout 2018, we expect that our overall oil differential, excluding hedges, will also trend lower. Currently,we anticipate that our overall differential for the first quarter of 2018 will be in the positive $0.75 to $1 range, and for the second to fourth quarters,we are currently anticipating our oil differential to be in a range of flat with NYMEX to a positive $0.50.     Slide 18 provides a summary of our oil price hedges. Since our last quarter's conference call, we added 2018 hedges covering 10,000 barrels perday of NYMEX and LLS-fixed price swaps. Our hedges now represent approximately 65% to 70% of our currently anticipated 2018 production levels.For 2019, we have begun to layer in a combination of fixed-price swaps and three-way collars. Our initial hedging objectives for 2019 [will] protect$55 and provide upside exposure to the mid-60s with collars and protect close to $60 with swaps. We plan to continue to add to our 2019 hedgesover the course of the year depending on market conditions.     Moving to the next slide. I'd like to review some of our expense line items, starting the G&A. Our G&A expense was $21 million for Q4, 25% lowerthan the third quarter and the lowest quarterly level in 9 years.     In the lower right-hand portion of this slide, you can see our G&A per BOE, which was $3.64 per BOE in Q4, the lowest level we have had in quitesome time. Our G&A is now beginning to reflect the significant cost reductions implemented in the third quarter. Our net G&A related to stock-based     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 117                compensation was approximately $3 million this quarter, and we currently expect our G&A for 2018 to remain in the lower $20 million range perquarter, with stock-based compensation representing roughly $3 million to $5 million of that amount.     Net interest expense was $23 million this quarter, a slight increase from last quarter due to the additional interest treated as debt resulting fromour most recent debt exchange transactions. On the bottom portion of this slide, you will see there is a more detailed breakout of the componentsof interest expense. We currently expect our capitalized interest to be in the $7 million to $8 million range per quarter throughout 2018.     Our DD&A expense this quarter was $53 million, a slight increase from the third quarter. We expect our DD&A expense will be in the $53 millionto $56 million range throughout 2018.     Our income taxes this quarter were significantly impacted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation enacted in December, which, among otherthings, lowered the federal income tax rate for corporations from 35% or 21%.     Since we are in a net deferred tax liability position, this reduced the company's future tax liabilities, resulting in a $132 million income tax benefitthis quarter.     For 2018, we expect that our effective tax rate will be close to 25%, with little or no cash taxes.     Turning to our 2018 sources and uses on Slide 20. As Chris mentioned, we built our 2018 budget around a $55 oil price, and we plan to keep ourspending within cash flow as we have historically done. Note that at the top of our -- on the top our $300 million to $325 million of developmentcapital, we estimate approximately $30 million for capitalized interest, which brings our total CapEx range to $330 million to $355 million.     As shown on the right-hand portion of this slide, we estimate that our 2018 cash flow from operations will be in the $430 million to $480 millionrange, assuming $55 WTI prices, and also assuming $30 million of interest being capitalized. Due to the accounting for our debt exchanges completedover the last couple of years, roughly $90 million of interest on our debt will be shown in our financial statements as a reduction of debt insteadof interest expense. So to give you an accurate reflection of cash available to spend, we have subtracted this amount from our estimated cash flowfrom operations, bringing our cash flow to an adjusted range of $340 million to $390 million, and giving us excess net cash flow of $10 million to$35 million.     One other thing I'd like to point out on this slide is the sensitivity of cash flow to oil prices. Excluding hedges, a $5 change in oil price would impactour cash flow by around $100 million. Considering our 2018 hedge positions, if prices average $50 for the year, we would only expect a cash flowreduction of $50 million. And if prices average $60 for the year, we would expect a gain of $30 million in cash flow.     Moving to our balance sheet. Pro forma for the debt exchange transaction completed in early January, we have total debt principal of approximately$2.7 billion as of December 31, 2017. We had $475 million outstanding in our bank credit facility and over $500 million of remaining borrowingbase availability.     Since the oil price downturn that began in 2014, we have reduced our debt principal by $836 million. The earliest maturity of our debt is our bankfacility, which matures in December 2019, and we have started initial conversations with our lead bank regarding the extension of this facility in2018. Our main priority will be to retain ample liquidity and full access to our billion fifty borrowing base. We believe that our value sustaining assetbase and improving debt metrics gives Denbury a much different debt profile than what is reflected in our trailing 12-month leverage metrics.     Although our trailing 12-month debt-to-EBITDA ratio is in the 6.5x range, we see this improving meaningfully throughout 2018 and 2019, assumingoil prices remain in a $55 to $60 price range. We also see a path for Denbury to approach 3.5x total leverage given a $60 oil price environment overthe next couple of years and with our existing asset base.     Based on our current projections, we expect our outstanding bank debt to come down throughout the year to the $300 million to $400 millionrange, largely due to anticipated proceeds from our Houston area land sales.     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

6,64388628,DENBURY RESOURCES,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, DNR",Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call,Timothy A. Rezvan,"Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division",MD of Americas Research,True,False,"I got a few here. I guess I'll start. The Cedar Creek Anticline EOR decision. Chris, you've repeatedly put out a first half '18 event. And then the slidedeck has language saying that the company's looking to establish a path forward. Given that we're at the end of February here, the first half is only4 more months, can you give any color on kind of where you stand or what you're pursuing? Or how that possibly could look getting to FID there?"
7,64388628,DENBURY RESOURCES,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, DNR",Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call,Christian S. Kendall,Denbury Resources Inc.,"CEO, President & Director",True,False,"Tim. So the way back I think about these, first of all, it's just such a great target upwards of 300 million barrels of potentially EOR resource up there,which is well in excess of our total current proved reserve base. So it's something that you really want to chase after. And what we're doing, eventhrough the downturn, we've kept the permitting process, which is really the main time impact on the whole project. We've kept that runningthrough the downturn. And I think, what I see us heading towards is a confluence of getting the permitting resolved to a point where we canproceed, and we're feeling pretty good about that in the first part of this year. Getting the technical work and getting that piece of done, and that'severy bit of that that I've seen as we've come through the last couple of quarters, is starting to come to a head. Again, with this objective of gettingthat landed in the first half of this year. And then, the project work and taking into account some of the learnings that we've picked up over thelast few years and reducing -- optimizing the cost of our facilities and making a fit for purpose-type of development on the facility side. That's allcoming together, very focused on getting that decided the first half of this year. And then what I see is that would put us in a position to have thepipe, which is a major single investment late in 2019, get injection started in '20 and then see first production in '21. So that's the framework thatwe're seeing there, Tim. And I think that, at least everything I've seen so far, is very positive."

So are you -- are there plans that you might -- that you may go ahead without really looking for a partner, some kind of third-partycapital infusion on the project?"

Kendall,Denbury Resources Inc.,"CEO, President & Director",True,False,"No. One piece that I didn't mention in my description there is that we're looking at how we fund that and some different options there. Honestly,we'd prefer not to take the chunky capital of the pipeline in 1 year. We have a lot of other very nice projects we'd like to do with that. And so partof the process we're working through the same time is exactly that, is looking at different paths for bringing in some outside capital for doing that.And as you mentioned, that is a great type of business that, I think, people are interested in investing in. And so that's something that will happenalong the same time and to some degree, perhaps, even beyond the first half of the year, but I don't see any risk associated with that.     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

You talked about marketing some of your mature assets. It looks likeproduction a little over 7,000 a day on that. Was that a separate decision from possible funding CCA? Or others kind of -- do you see those asintegrated decisions?"

That really -- looking at our portfolio is something that we should be doing every quarter, every year, andmaking sure that our portfolio makes the most sense for our priorities and where we want to deploy our capital and, honestly, just our focus. Sothey are separate, but I do see that at the end of the day, we're -- there's going to be a question of proceeds from that sale, what are you going todo with those? And we're very open with where that'd be deployed, whether it's into reducing debt, into the assets and something like CCA ordoing something else with it. But that is a possibility, but they were arrived at separately really just makes sense for us to look at these assets andget our portfolio as optimized as we can."

The 4Q '17, the unit expense profile was very strong. But if -- I can understandit from the prepared comments, you expect LOE to up to about $0.50. Should we think about that as $0.50 from the full year 2017 average, whichgets us closer to kind of a 21 level? Or is that from the 4Q '17 kind of level?"

Obviously, there's a lot to be gained from continuedfocus at the field level on what we can do to improve that, and we're continuing to work other paths to improving it. Honestly, optimizing ourportfolio will do that to some degree, growing our production will do it to another back. But to frame that, I think, you're right looking at the fullyear."

First, the area in Conroe there that's near The Woodlands,south of the town of Conroe. And that is one main parcel or one main piece of real estate that's broken up into 7 parcels. And all of those parcelsare going out for an RFP on March 1 of this year. So just a couple of weeks from now. And we expect to have bids in that by the end of March andsee some notional -- we expect to get some purchase and sale agreements executed in the second quarter. So that's something that, I think, you'dsee something from us in the second quarter. Then as we move south to Webster, that this multiple different parcels. Just the nature of their realestate there along the frontage road, on I-45 going down to Galveston, there are many different nice things we can do with the -- with that propertyand that will be something that I think you'll see starting to come in over the course of '18, and might even be beyond that. But there's a lot ofinterest, a lot of good things happening there. Kind of 2 different things. A big piece in Conroe that we'll see some numbers on in the second quarterand then the rest of it in Webster that will happen throughout the year here.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

So we have 1 well that's been producing for really less than 2 months now.Certainly, we're pleased with what we've seen. We want to get more time with the well that we've drilled. We want to get more wells drilled andget some production history behind there. If you look at the map that we've provided for the Mission Canyon area that we're drilling right now, asI mentioned, we've already spudded the second well on that same structure. And we really don't see anything different that we expect in the next2 wells in terms of where we are geologically and what we're looking for. It's more of just testing the same concept and the same accumulationand establishing some production history. As we move outside of the Pennel and Coral Creek area, which is one of these first wells will be, thenthere're some different ideas that we're going to be testing, but again, all of it is generally the same concept with this fairly narrow interval ofMission Canyon. It's very productive, and we have some good running room across the CCA area with it."

Wethink there's numerous possibilities and, I think, the one thing that really -- and I said before, that differentiates us is just our assets and they'resustaining value. Yes our leverage metrics have been higher than we would like and we're starting to see those move here in the right direction.With cost reductions and prices, which is, I think one very positive sign and I think over the last few years, our bank group has continued to workwith us quite well and we just -- we're confident in how we're going to move forward here."

I'm curious if you can talk about what the, what kind of decline profile you're seeing and you expect to see in this well?When I just look at your current EOR and the rate, the way those 2 fit together make it seem like it's a pretty high decline well. But I wanted to justtest that because we've gotten to the point -- we've answered the question about or maybe addressed the question of how repeatable that is, butalso how good is this? So can you talk about how -- what you're seeing in 2 months of decline on this?"
29,64388628,DENBURY RESOURCES,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, DNR",Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call,Christian S. Kendall,Denbury Resources Inc.,"CEO, President & Director",True,False,"You bet. So what I'd say, Charles, is that first of all, that the EOR that you had seen that we disclosed publically was a predrill expectation so there'sgoing to be some adjustment to that as we go. I would still say it's early days on how this behaves. But if you think about just the nature of puttinga long lateral in a pretty thin reservoir, we'd expect it to behave, honestly, more like an unconventional well where you have some fairly high initialdecline rates. We're going to keep watching that. We're not to the point where we have enough of a track record out here with it to really talk intoo much detail. But what I would say, look at it to be along the lines of what you'd expect more in the unconventional side with the benefit ofthese wells being that we are completing open hole without of frac and the cost associated with that.     10     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Thank you. If I could ask also about -- if you could talk a bit more about the exploitation you're doing at Tinsley andthis Parise Sand. Did I hear you right that is one of the traditional field pays that's maybe under CO2 flood in different parts of the field? And areyou guys planning on going at this with a being frac? Or what's your plan of attack?"

So what's interesting about that and it's even -- it even applies back to the Mission Canyon, Charles, is that these -- certain of these reservoirs,when we produce them on primary, when that's complete, they set themselves up very nicely for CO2. And that's the case with Mission Canyon,and that'll be the same for Perry. With the Perry, it's an area of the Tinsley Field that we don't have perm for traditional vertical wells to really do agreat job of sweeping with EOR so we have a lot of residual oil left in that horizon. And that's why we're going to attack this one with the horizontalsagain. We are going to have to put a bit of a frac in these, we think, to get the rates that we want. So it'll be a little different, although just if youkind of balance the whole nature of the -- of that field and the depth of the reservoir, our well costs are going to be in the same ballpark as whatyou saw with Mission Canyon."

Going back to the potential sale of the mature properties. It sounds like if you're expecting possibly to havesome news in the second quarter, things, I guess, are moving along. Is this more of a package to one party? Or would you expect to break it up?Have you received inbound interest on this that kind of started things off?"

Obviously, we've hit on cost reductions. We've done some exchanges,utilizing our capital structure and the flexibility that it has provided. I think we still have some flexibility remaining there. We have some newinstruments in the last exchanges in the form of converts, which could provide some optionality, and we'd like to see those convert here at somepoint. But we still think what really drives our ability forward here is obviously, we're doing a lot of great things on our operations side, we havesome new projects, but more than that is really just getting back to the sustaining nature of our reserves and the fact that our reserve basis is verydesirable, it doesn't deplete rapidly over time. And so when people look at that from an investment standpoint, they appreciate that, and it has atotally different profile. So all those things combined, I'd say, still give us a lot of flexibility and ways to think about continuing to improve ourbalance sheet over time, Richard."

The first thing I'd say about Bell Creek, and you might have noticed it on our production table, is that without contribution fromPhase 5, we still reached a new EOR record in the fourth quarter there, and our teams have just done a superb job of working through the -- Phases1 through 4 with -- and optimizing our production there. Did some creative nice work to continue to grow production from the initial phases. ThenPhase 5, we expect to start to see the response. We actually have it completed, as I mentioned, and we're injecting, and we have the initial response,which is, essentially, water production that's very strong. It looks good to us. We're optimistic about how it's going to respond with oil. We expectto see that midyear. Not really ready to talk about the volumes that we expect, but I think that what you've seen in our overall guide representsprobably a conservative view of what we think about that. And then, of course, Phase 6, we're following right beyond Phase 5 so that will beexecuted through the course of this year with response expected in 2019.
