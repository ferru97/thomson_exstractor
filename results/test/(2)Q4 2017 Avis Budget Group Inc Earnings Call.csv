As I look back at 2017, despite operating in an extremely challenging environment in the first half of the year, we madesignificant and substantial strides that will solidify our position in the vehicle rental and mobility industry, enabling us to provide better productsand services to our customers, while also increasing shareholder value. Steps such as, significantly increasing our fleet of connected cars; launchingthe industry's first mobility lab; partnering with Waymo to support its fleet of autonomous vehicles; launching our fully integrated Demand FleetPricing system; making strategic investments in our business that will lower our costs and further our leading position in the rapidly changingmobility landscape; and generating $354 million of adjusted free cash flow; and repurchasing $200 million of our own shares. And we ended theyear on a very positive note. We had a strong fourth quarter driven by good global volume growth, increased pricing, including our secondconsecutive quarter of positive pricing in the Americas and stable fleet costs. Our emphasis on driving manpower and shuttling efficiencies continuedto yield positive results and our commitment to cost management was also effective in the quarter with our adjusted EBITDA margin improvingyear-over-year.     But before getting ahead of myself, I would like to now turn the call over to Martyn to discuss our results for the fourth quarter as well as our outlookfor 2018."
2,64388164,AVIS BUDGET GROUP INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, CAR",Q4 2017 Avis Budget Group Inc Earnings Call,Martyn Smith,"Avis Budget Group, Inc.",Interim CFO,False,True,"Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'm now going to discuss our fourth quarter results together with our fleet, cash flow, liquidity andoutlook for the full year, together with an update on the effects of U.S. tax reform and of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. Mycomments will largely focus on our adjusted results, which, as Neal mentioned, are reconciled from our GAAP numbers both in our press releaseand earnings call presentation.     Firstly, starting with an overview of our fourth quarter. Strong volume growth and positive pricing led to total company revenue increasing by 7%.Fleet costs in the Americas were unchanged year-on-year, a significant improvement to the first half, while International fleet costs were 5% lowerin local currency. This, in conjunction with our cost mitigating actions and the $5 million benefit from foreign exchange, led to a 16% improvementin our adjusted EBITDA to $140 million for the quarter with a 50 basis point improvement in margin.     For the whole of 2017, we increased total company revenue by 2% to $8.8 billion, driven by strong 5% volume growth and 2% lower local currencypricing. Company-wide per-unit fleet costs increased by 3% in local currency, partially offset by the cost mitigating actions implemented throughoutthe year. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA was $735 million.     Now to go into further detail on the results, starting first with the Americas. Our focus on driving the most profitable transactions through improvedchannel and customer mix were evident in this quarter. Leisure volume and pricing each increased 5%, achieving a particularly strong Christmasseason. Commercial volume and pricing were both unchanged in the quarter, the second consecutive quarter of flat rate per day, as we focusedon the most profitable commercial customers. This performance resulted in a 3% improvement on Americas revenue for the quarter, with overallpricing increasing by more than 2% in local currency. Across all of 2017, we grew Americas volume by 2%, while pricing was 1% lower, but rate perday improving in the second half of the year.     Now turning to Americas costs, particularly fleet. Per-unit fleet costs increased 6% for the full year, but were flat in quarter 4 with used car pricescontinuing their recovery from the first half of 2017, helped by small benefit from post-hurricane effects, and, and you will hear more in detailshortly, a great performance in alternative disposition channels. Despite a difficult start to the year and hurricane-related disruptions, utilizationstill improved by 13 basis points in 2017. With our strategy to keep our fleet tight relative to demand, we plan to further improve utilization thisyear, assisted by the approach to our model year '18 buy, where we consciously contracted for fewer vehicles compared to model year '17. Wecontinue to see benefits from our strategic initiative to sell more of our risk fleet through alternative disposition channels. In the quarter, alternativechannels accounted for 54% of our risk car sales compared to 42% in the prior year. For the full year, 50% of our risk cars were sold outside oftraditional auction channels compared to 37% in 2016, and we have plans in place to further increase that percentage again in 2018.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 537                As a reminder, the benefit from selling through these alternate channels is substantial, which is why I'm so excited about the progress we made in2017 and the opportunities still ahead of us. I'm also pleased with the way our teams pulled together in the quarter to drive savings for our costmitigation efforts. And as you will hear from Larry shortly, we made further progress to improve productivity in the quarter, both for our manpowerplanning and shuttling strategic initiatives. Consequently, Americas adjusted EBITDA increased 6% in the quarter to $107 million, driven by revenuegrowth as well as from the benefits of greater efficiencies and our cost saving measures.     Now turning to our International segment. We grew revenue substantially at 12% in local currency for the quarter. Pricing improved 1% in localcurrency year-over-year. Rental days increased 15%, including an 8% benefit from the France Cars business, which was acquired in December 2016,and benefiting from a particularly strong Christmas break in Europe and a good summer in Australia. This performance was evenly spread with ourEMEA and APAC businesses benefiting from robust organic volume growth increasing 7% and 8% respectively. We drove volume -- sorry, we drovecommercial volume growth in the quarter up 10% year-over-year with particularly strong demand in Australia, Germany and Italy. We also achievedgood leisure volume growth, increasing 5% year-on-year with robust demand in France, Spain and Australia; and inbound volume was healthy,up 6% for the quarter. International per-unit fleet costs were 5% lower in quarter 4 in local currency. This, combined with a strong revenue growth,a good overall cost performance and a $4 million currency exchange benefit led to adjusted EBITDA increasing 25% in the quarter or 13% in localcurrency. For the full year, International revenue increased 6% in local currency and 8% reported, with a 12% increase in volume, partially offsetby 3% lower local currency pricing.     Combined with International per-unit fleet costs of 1% lower in local currency, benefits from our cost mitigating actions and a $24 million benefitfrom currency, full year International adjusted EBITDA increased by 12% to a record $305 million.     Now to move on to our cash flow and funding position, plus an overview of the material effects from U.S. tax reform and the new revenue recognitionstandard.     Starting with cash flow. In spite of the challenges faced in 2017, we generated $354 million of adjusted free cash flow. Non-fleet CapEx was $198million, which was in line with our non-vehicle depreciation. For 2018, we expect to spend around $220 million on non-fleet CapEx as we increaseinvestment in certain growth initiatives, particularly connected cars. We also have a pipeline of strategically attractive tuck-in acquisitions, someof which we expect to close over the next few months, including license fees in the U.S., Germany and France, as well as taking an initial 20% stakein our Avis Budget licensee in Greece.     We bought back 1.9 million shares at the cost of $73 million in the fourth quarter at an average price of $39.59 per share. For the full year, our sharerepurchases totaled 6.1 million shares at the cost of $200 million or $32.87 per share. Repurchases for the year represent approximately 6% of ourcurrent market cap. Our financial position remains strong with approximately $5.7 billion of available liquidity. It comprised ending the quarterwith $611 million of cash and having $1 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facility, plus $4.1 billion capacity under our vehicleprograms at the end of 2017, reflecting the seasonality of our business.     Our net corporate leverage of 4.06x continues to hover around the top of our targeted range of 3 to 4x. However, our leverage ratio for covenantpurposes at year-end was 3.92x, almost a turn below the maximum ratio of 4.75x as then defined. As we announced last week, amidst strong creditmarket conditions, we extended both components of our senior credit facility with favorable terms and with no change to interest rate charged.The revolving portion of the facility was extended 2 years to 2023, and the term loan component was extended by 3 years to 2025. In addition, aspart of the amendment, the financial covenant would change from a consolidated leverage ratio to instead what is called a first lien leverage ratio.Under the amendment, the total amount now borrowed only under the senior credit facility cannot exceed 2.5x consolidated EBITDA.     Based on our 2017 consolidated EBITDA and term loan balance at year-end, leverage under our new covenant would pro forma have been 1.4x atDecember 31. These amendments, therefore, provide significant additional headroom and improve on our already robust liquidity profile.     Before moving to our 2018 guidance, I want to briefly discuss the impact of U.S. tax reform and some changes we are making for financial reportinggoing forward. First, the passage of the recent tax act resulted in us reporting an initial estimated net benefit of $213 million in the quarter, resultingfrom the $317 million revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities from the change in corporate tax rate, partially offset by $104 million one-timetax charge on cumulative foreign earnings. These initial estimates will be trued up later in the year.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 538                We presently intend to use existing NOLs to settle the tax due on foreign earnings, rather than paying cash over the 8-year period. In addition, asa result of that tax act, we anticipate our effective tax rate will be lower going forward, and currently expect it to be between 25% and 27%.     Second, we are making some changes on our reporting. As you saw the outlook section and the tables earnings of our release last night, alongwith the implementation of the new revenue recognition accounting standard on January 20, 2018, and in anticipation of adopting the new leasingstandard in January '19, we have reviewed our relevant key reported metrics. As a result of that review, going forward, to ensure comparability toour metrics period-over-period, we will now begin to measure and report pricing using total revenue per day, defined as total revenue includingall of our brands divided by rental days. We will focus on this metric expressed in local currency, and will also show separately the FX impact andreported currency metrics as well. We believe this is helpful to both management and investors as it represents the meaningful measure of overallpricing, including the effects of bundling. This definition is also more comparable to others in the industry.     We have provided in Table 6 of last night's earnings release our prior years' revenue per day to show the last 8 quarters calculated under our newpricing metric definition so that you can update your model. Just to note that, in addition, we've also provided in Table 7 per-unit fleet costs, whichnow, to ensure consistency with our revenue metric comprises all brands, so now includes our U.S. truck business which was previously excludedfrom this metric.     Back to revenue and moving to our loyalty program. As a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standards, eachtransaction that generates customer loyalty points will now result in a deferral of revenue and that revenue being subsequently recognized oncustomer redemption or forfeiture. Previously, we did not defer revenue, but instead recorded an operating expense associated with the costs ofproviding the future rentals under the then-prevailing accounting rules. We expect this revenue deferral related to loyalty will negatively impactAmericas reported pricing by around 50 to 75 basis points in 2018, including an approximate 1 point impact in the first quarter of the year withthe effects progressively decreasing as the year goes on. This change is broadly profit neutral across the year, primarily impacting where the costis recorded on the income statement. To confirm, there is no cash impact from this change.     With those considerations in mind, now to turn to our 2018 outlook. We expect our revenues to grow between 4% and 7%, including an approximate$160 million to $180 million currency benefit. Americas volume is expected to be between 1% and 3% and International volume growth to bebetween 5% and 7%. We expect pricing for the Americas to be in the range between unchanged to up 2% versus prior year, and International localcurrency pricing to be flat to down 2%. Our guidance is based on new revenue per day metric and includes the approximately 50 to 75 basis pointeffect we are anticipating in 2018 related to the accounting change for our loyalty program on our Americas pricing, which I discussed earlier.Guidance under the previous time and mileage metrics would have been broadly similar. We expect our per-unit fleet costs in Americas to be inthe range down 1% to up 1%. This is partially a result of our model year '18 buy, which had prices coming in a couple of percentage points lowerthan the prior year. Implicit in our guidance is the expectation that market values of late model used cars will be lower this year, and we expectInternational per-unit fleet costs to be flat to up 2% in local currency.     And as we noted previously, we face a number of cost headwinds in 2018 which will impact our results. These include the resetting in marketingbudgets and incentive compensation as well as the approximately $20 million higher vehicle interest expense resulting from rising U.S. interestrates, plus the effects of volume growth on our vehicle interest cost. These effects are partially offset by high utilization, which I discussed earlier,and the annualization of our 2017 mitigating actions, as well as an approximate $25 million to $30 million currency benefit to adjusted EBITDA. Asa consequence, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to increase to between $740 million and $820 million.     It is also important for me to point out that the effects of the increased marketing spending this year should be most pronounced as a percentageof revenue in the first quarter. This effect will be exacerbated by the timing of loyalty accounting, being broadly neutral across the whole year,however, with a negative impact on adoption in the first quarter. In addition, given the faster leisure growth we have seen in the past few years,our profits now skew even more towards the middle 2 quarters. These factors are expected to limit our first quarter profit improvement. We expect-- we estimate our non-vehicle depreciation and amortization, excluding acquisition-related amortization, to be approximately $210 million. Weexpect our adjusted EPS to be between $2.90 and $3.75 per share, benefiting from both pretax profit growth and the now lower expected tax rate.We expect our free cash flow to be between $325 million and $375 million.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 539                Lastly, we currently plan to deploy around $100 million of this free cash flow for the strategic tuck-in acquisitions, which I discussed earlier. In linewith our practice in recent years, we also intend to continue to return capital to shareholders. This will likely be in the second half of 2018, broadlymatching our seasonal cash flow.     In summary, we saw a strong fourth quarter driven by global volume growth and increased pricing in the Americas. We made marked improvementsin our ability to dispose through lower cost channels in 2017, an initiative we will continue in 2018. We recently modified the terms of our seniorcredit facility both extending its maturity and gaining greater covenant headroom. We have an attractive pipeline of both growth CapEx andstrategic tuck-in acquisitions, both in the Americas and International regions. And we remain highly positive about our business and are projectingboth revenue and profits to grow this year despite facing a number of headwinds.     With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Larry. Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Thank you, Martyn. Before we take questions, I wanted to discuss some of our strategic initiatives that we believe have the ability to drive meaningfuland sustainable margin expansion over time as we demonstrated in the fourth quarter, while also enabling us to succeed in the growing marketfor mobility services.     Starting with profitable revenue growth. Our fully integrated Demand Fleet Pricing yield management system which makes recommendationsabout both pricing and fleet based on the forecasted demand is now live in 12 markets. We are finding that the improvements in our length ofrental and utilization that we saw in our smaller pilot markets are applicable to larger markets as well. This gives me great confidence as we rollthe full system out across the rest of the United States. And in Europe, the first phase of the system, the Pricing Robotic, is now live in over 50markets, allowing us to be far more responsive to changes in the marketplace with full market coverage expected ahead of this year's summerpeak.     Our initiatives to drive incremental bookings through our direct channels are also producing great results. Conversion rates in the Americas increasedby 120 basis points in the quarter, while prepaid reservations increased 600 basis points year-over-year, and now represent over 35% of reservationsmade on our proprietary platform. Ancillary revenue continued to be a challenge in the fourth quarter, but the bundling initiative we launched atthe end of last year is showing promise, particularly on the Avis brand. We have also made ancillaries easier to select for customers that book onour website and I'm excited about the early results. Americas' ancillary sales grew 4% on avis.com in the quarter, including an 8% improvementfor the month of December.     Our Avis mobile app also continues to be a big success story. The app gives customers the ability to not only make a reservation, but to instantlyexchange and upgrade their vehicle at any time, even as they stand in front of the car in the lot. The app has now been used in more than 1 millionrentals since its launch and 55% of users have used the app multiple times. The success of the app is clear with Net Promoter Scores 25% higherfor preferred customers who use the app than those who do not. The progress we have made with the Avis app which was developed with insightsfrom our customers is yet another way we are exceeding their expectations and differentiating ourselves from our competitors.     We have great travel partners around the world and we recently added to those ranks. In November, we entered into a multi-year agreement withChoice Hotels under the agreement the Avis and Budget brands were named preferred car rental partners for Choice Hotels and their ChoicePrivileges rewards program, enabling us to drive incremental volume as we market our products and services to their 33 million members worldwide.In December, we further strengthened our ranks as strategically important partners by entering into a multi-year agreement with Hawaiian Airlines,making Avis Budget Group their exclusive rental car partner. Hawaii continues to be a popular destination for not only American travelers, butamong travelers from other countries as well. With enplanements growing 5% in 2017 and continued growth forecasted for 2018, we grew ourHawaiian revenue double digits in 2017 and this agreement puts us in a premier position to further capitalize on this growth going forward. Andwe extended our exclusive partnership with American Airlines, the world's largest airline, earlier this year for an additional 4 years.     In addition to great partners, we also have strong licensees around the world, which is why I'm so excited that our licensee for the Budget brandin Japan recently signed an agreement to take on the Avis brand as well. The Avis brand has been absent from Japan for over 14 years. So to     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

And with Japan hostingthe Rugby World Cup 2019 and the Olympics in 2020, the timing couldn't have been better.     Moving now to our initiatives to drive cost savings and efficiencies across our organization. Our new manpower planning technology has nowbeen completely rolled out across all United States cities, allowing us to move -- to most effectively match our staffing levels to our business peaks,driving a 5% improvement in year-over-year productivity in the quarter. We expect this initiative to drive further savings in 2018 as we achieve afull year benefit from our technology investment.     We also continue to see nice improvement in our shuttling initiatives leading to a 9% year-over-year reduction in shuttling per transaction in thequarter with additional benefits expected in 2018. We've also been making investments in technology to strengthen our underlying core systemswhile driving further costs out of our business. These include a major rebuild of our main reservation and rental system which will be completedthis year. The implementation of Workday, a cloud-based human resource system, to which all our employees are now connected. As well asmodernizing our financial systems on to a new cloud-based, globally unified application, a journey we embarked on last year. Each of theseinvestments is strategic to running the business and provides enormous flexibility to enable us to take advantage of future technological changes.     Turning now to Mobility. We continued to innovate in new ways to cater to our customers' needs with our Zipcar brand. Zipcar Flex, our floatingproduct offering in the United Kingdom, which allows members to drop their car off at any permitted location, continued its expansion in Londonin the fourth quarter with additional boroughs slated for 2018. With more and more municipalities in Continental Europe now requiring car-sharingcompanies to offer a floating product in order to compete in the market, Flex is an important addition to Zipcar's product lineup. And in the U.S.,our Zipcar commuter service is now available to 90% of our Zipcar customer base. This monthly service, which offers our customers recurrentweekly use of a car including insurance and a designated parking spot, provides a cost-effective alternative to car ownership. We substantiallyexpanded this offering since the end of Q3 and have seen a healthy month-over-month demand growth for this service. In November, we announcedKansas City as our market for the Connected City pilot. And after only a few short months, I'm even more convinced that connected cars will enhanceour business, both from an operational standpoint and from a customer experience perspective. Vehicles in the Kansas City area are able to tell uswhen they need to be serviced and when they are ready to be put back on rent. A connected car's ability to measure fuel consumption allows aclearer billing process for our customers. And our teams have identified additional opportunities to drive productivity and improve customersatisfaction. We've also partnered with Continental to integrate keyless functionality into our connected cars. With this technology, a customercan lock, unlock and start their rental car from their Avis mobile app. We successfully demonstrated this new technology at last month's ConsumerElectronics Show in Las Vegas, and are excited to bring this technology to our customers. Moving forward, we are partnering with OEMs and otherthird parties to expand our connected car capabilities with the goal of more than doubling our connected car fleet in 2018.     Our partnership with Waymo, the autonomous driving division of Alphabet, also continues to move forward with expanded services. As a reminder,our company entered into a partnership with Waymo to provide fleet services for their self-driving car program in Phoenix in June. We have locationsthat are in full operation and servicing the Waymo fleet of autonomous cars. Waymo has moved into their deployment phase, operating vehicleson public roads without a test driver, and we're excited about their plans to add thousands more vehicles to their fleet. We remain committed toexpanding our operations to accommodate Waymo's growth and are enthusiastic about the opportunities to learn and benefit from this partnership.     To summarize, despite a difficult first half, our business rebounded nicely in the second half of the year with pricing and fleet costs in the Americasimproving significantly, and we reached 50% alternative disposition channels sales in the Americas for the first time since we started this initiative.We also drove further improvement in our manpower and shuttling efficiency initiatives and took aggressive cost saving actions leading to marginimprovement in the fourth quarter. We also drove meaningful improvement in our mobile conversion. Our Avis app has now been used in morethan 1 million rentals and the fully integrated Demand Fleet Pricing system was launched and is delivering on its promise. Our mobility efforts arealso bearing fruit as evidenced by our partnership with Waymo, the launch of Zipcar's commuter product and the expansions of Zipcar to Taiwanand Costa Rica, and our work with RocketSpace to accelerate innovation and mobility. We signed new and exciting partnerships in 2017, includingChoice Hotels and Hawaiian Airlines. We're investing in long-term growth initiatives such as connected car. And as Martyn discussed, we extendedour term loan and amended our credit agreement without any increase in our interest rates. And while we continue to face some cost headwindsgoing into this year, the initiatives we implemented in 2017 to strengthen our operations are providing tangible benefits and leave us well positionedin 2018.     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

4,64388164,AVIS BUDGET GROUP INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, CAR",Q4 2017 Avis Budget Group Inc Earnings Call,Chris Jon Woronka,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",Research Analyst,True,False,"I wanted to ask you as you think about how pricing unfolded in the fourth quarter, how do you bucket that between maybe industry-wide supply,some of your own revenue initiatives and demand growth? Is there a way to parse that out if you can? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Well, what I'd say is that we've been working really hard on the commercial side of the business to really start targeting segments of the businessthat produced a higher rate per day. So we've been really zoning in on our mid-market accounts and our small business accounts to try to bringmore higher-rated per-day business into the segment. You couple that with we had just a really robust Thanksgiving and Christmas season. A very,very strong robust Christmas season. And I think also DFP, the Demand Fleet Pricing system, continues to yield benefit for us when we get intothose really peak periods where we're able to really yield our pricing up and that's what it was really designed to help us do. And we're seeing thatplay through as well as we looked at Thanksgiving and Christmas."

I guess the follow-up is on some of the mobility initiatives and specifically Waymo, but maybe some others that you haven't announcedyet. How do you generically see that unfolding over the next several years? Is there -- is '18 a much bigger year than '17? Or is '19 more -- I'm justcurious as to your thoughts as to how maybe your involvement evolves over time. Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Well, definitely we'll continue to expand our operations with Waymo as they continue to expand and add thousands of new cars to their program.We are talking to other mobility solution providers as far as how we might be able to partner with them and I think we'll start to see some of thoseunfold as well over '18 and into '19. And then I think as you look at our connected car initiative and the opportunities to partner with people as weexpand our connected car program into more fleet, it is definitely a longer-term approach to how we can drive more efficiencies into the businessand drive revenue opportunities through partnerships, through connectivity, as well as the service improvements that we can offer our customersas well. So I think there is a number of steps that will unfold over a number of years. And I think you'll continue to see us move down the mobilitypath each year, year-after-year, as it continues to grow as an important part of how we're going to develop our business over time."

Have you seen that momentum that you saw on the leisure side in the fourth quarter continue on? Orhave you seen any sort of breakage there? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Well, we're not really commenting on what actual pricing has been going on in the quarter. What I would say is that a couple of things. One is thatthe dynamic -- the industry are what you would normally expect in the first quarter. The times of the week and the weeks of the quarter that youwould expect for the industry to be tight on fleet, the industry has been, and on the times of the quarter where you would expect it not to be, ithasn't been. The first quarter is more of a commercial quarter. There's not much activity other than the spring break, but they don't drive the volumeof business that causes the industry to really run out of cars, as like Thanksgiving and like Christmas does. So the first quarter is typically a morecommercial quarter. So you're not going to find as many opportunities for things like DFP to work and really be able to yield up your pricing. Butwhat I would say is that the first quarter is not at all like we've been experiencing in the last few years. It's back to what you would normally expectfirst quarter fleet to be behaving like. And with the Easter kind of the 1st of April, you might get a couple days of benefits in the end of March. Butthere's just not a lot of peak activity happening in the first quarter."

And then I wanted to ask just a little bit about fleet interest cost. I've gotten a lot of questions about how you guys may be impactedby rising rates and the amount of maturities that you have on the fleet size coming up the next couple of years. When you guys look at the piecesof debt that will fall off, say in '18 and '19, and what you might be able to replace those pieces at, how do you see fleet interest expense trendingmaybe over the next 2 to 3 years given the current rate environment that we are in today?"

So I called out a likely extra cost in 2018 of about $20 million. That is simply the U.S. interest rate, or the point you're picking up onthe variable fleet debt. The Eurozone, we're expecting to be flat for 2018 and a little bit of pick up in Australia and New Zealand. But really, it's theU.S. story at the moment. And then probably 2019 onwards, further U.S. increases and then the Eurozone then picking up. So we've got about $1.5billion naturally coming off next year and then we're replacing. So our $20 million reflects essentially our anticipation of those maturities comethrough as the renewal as well. So there will be quite an increase progressively coming up over the next couple of years. But it's obviouslyindustry-wide, not just ourselves."

Tamberrino,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",Associate Analyst,True,False,"Larry, I'm wondering how the industry-wide fleet is in the U.S. Looking at the fourth quarter, your fleet continued to grow in the same lines as wherevolume was, so utilization was flat. And I think from your comments, you planning to undergrow your expected volume increase for the year todrive utilization up. Curious to what you're seeing from a discipline standpoint from your major competitors.     9     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Yes. Just first of all, about our fourth quarter fleet coming in at about flat on the utilization perspective. What really drove that -- I mean, our intentis to build a fleet to underdemand. We're going to continue to drive utilization, and we have that built into our plan for 2018. What happened reallyin the fourth quarter is when the hurricane -- the first hurricane hit, we actually pulled forward deliveries that were going to be delivered late inthe quarter, beginning of the first quarter this year, to help meet that demand of relief work demand, plus where we just thought fleets were goingto tighten up for insurance replacement business that other car rental companies might take. We pulled some fleet forward into the quarter. Andwhen the relief business didn't materialize, or at least didn't stay the length that we had plans for it and how it has really occurred in previoushurricanes as we discussed in the last quarter call, we had that fleet then in the quarter earlier and longer than we had really needed it. So the teamworked really hard as they went through the rest of the quarter to try to disperse that fleet, get it on rent and to delete fleet where possible, to getourselves back to kind of a flat position and also to be able to ensure that we have the right fleet for the opportunities for Thanksgiving andChristmas. So they did a really good job. Looking back now would we have pulled as many cars forward as we did? No. But we expected the reliefbusiness to be stronger and longer than it was. As far as the industry fleet levels, I would say, they were pretty typically normal. I think other peoplealso brought fleet forward, so the hurricane does kind of throw a little bit of difficulty into looking at the quarter. But once you get past that andyou just take a look at how the rest of the quarter unfolded and how we turned into the year, I would say fleet levels are back to what you wouldconsider a normal year and a normal turn into the new year."
12,64388164,AVIS BUDGET GROUP INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, CAR",Q4 2017 Avis Budget Group Inc Earnings Call,David J. Tamberrino,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",Associate Analyst,True,False,"Okay, understood. And just a little bit in line of question earlier. I know you don't want to talk about what you're seeing so far for the first coupleof months. But it would seem as if the fourth quarter pretty strong from a pricing perspective, but your full year even when we adjust for theaccounting change still implies slightly down from what the 4Q '17 levels were. Is that just an abundance of caution? Or is that indicative of whatyou're seeing so far in the first quarter understanding it's seasonably weak? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Well, I don't think you want to plan the full year pricing based on how you perform at Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we've had some difficultyears in pricing the last few years. And so we are looking at our year-over-year trends, we're looking at how we exited the year. We're taking all thatinto consideration. As we take -- we build our volume coming from the ground up. We don't just take the volume that we did last year and lap onan increase. We literally built it up account by account by account and our partnerships so forth and we get to where we really think our volumeis going to be. And so we -- the pricing reflects what we think will really happen as we transition out of what's been a very difficult period for thelast few years and some more normalized periods. And I hope we're wrong. I hope that pricing would be even stronger than that. We do have theloyalty impact that is impacting the year and will definitely impact more the first quarter the rest of the year. But no, I don't -- I wouldn't say it's aconservative approach. What I'm saying is that we just -- we need more than just at Thanksgiving and a Christmas to be more aggressive than whatwe're seeing."

De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Well, as I said earlier, we've been working really hard on trying to grow some of the other segments in the corporate channel business. The largecommercial accounts continue to be very competitive from everyone trying to win those accounts to the pricing that's offered in those accounts.We've -- we're not losing those accounts. We're hanging onto those accounts. We're hanging on to our share of those accounts. So we've beenreally focusing more of our attention on our mid-market and small business accounts, trying to win more of that business. It's a longer haul to dothat, but if we stay focused on it as we were all last year, we'll continue to drive more volume and commercial at a higher rate than what you'regoing to get with the large commercial accounts. And we're starting to see that pay off. As Martyn said, we've had kind of 2 months -- or 2 quartersin a row here where we've been able to improve -- keep our pricing flat on commercial and we've seen volume growth in the fourth quarter aswell, small volume uptake in the fourth quarter as well in the Commercial business. So that's far better than where we had been in the beginningpart of last year and the year before. So we're staying focused on building that, but now from a share perspective, we're holding onto our share,we're holding onto our account and we're trying to build those other segments that come at a higher profitability."

And just one more and I'll turn it over. Could you give us a sense of whether or not, in infrastructure build, it goes through, will it have anyimpact on the car rental industry? Or maybe you could frame how we should be thinking about that. Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Well, I think it does because I think anytime that you kind of invest in airports and create a better environment for consumers to transit to the airportto create better facilities, better traffic flows, those all help the rental car industry. So we're a big component of the infrastructure bill. We want tosee the investments made to modernize our airports and modernize our road and I think all of those play well to someone that's in the mobilitybusiness like we are to have roads that are up to date and to have the latest technology in the airports that we serve."

I'm wondering if you could elaborate more on the International environment, what you're seeing from competitors andwhether you think fleet size is more rational now versus prior quarters. Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     The pricing environment internationally continues to be really tough. We're -- we've been really fighting this fight now for the last couple of yearsand it doesn't really seems to be getting -- there doesn't seem to be strategic changes in the competition that's going to change anytime soon.That's why we're rolling out our pricing robotic and then eventually we'll get to the final phases of DFP there as well so that it can have the benefit,our International team can have the benefit of being able to forecast further out, be able to take advantage of more yielding opportunities, havethe confidence that fleet will tighten up in periods so that they can make decisions further out to drive more length of rental, improve their utilization.So those things are all actions that we're taking to improve pricing from our own perspective, but the industry dynamic really aren't changing. Weare seeing a growth of the third tier segment, providers allowed people getting into kind of the lower tier offering. It really started and kind ofworked to go in Spain and expanded into Italy and now starting to expand into some other countries as well. And that's something that we'regoing to need to contend with as far as how we compete in that the third tier. So yes, things are -- we're managing through it. And as we said, theyhad a really good year last year overall. But they did -- they weren't helped by pricing. They had to do it for a lot of other hard work, driving volume,cost cutting, being more efficient, and we would, we would really want to see pricing improve there.     11     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Within your expectation for total RPD flat, I think it's really more like up half a point to 2.5points x the headwind from the accounting change you mentioned. Could you just break out your underlying assumptions for core time andmileage versus ancillary? And I have asked this because, last year, on a total RPD basis, it was down roughly 2 points, ancillary down I think low-singledigits as well. Just what's -- what are the broad strokes or what's driving the turnaround in ancillaries because I know it's been under pressure inthe past? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Yes. I think if you were to put our guidance in context of our old metric, it would be pretty much the same. Our ancillary revenue has been underpressure. And as we've said, and we are working hard to kind of turn that around, we're pretty excited about what we're seeing online. Our onlineteam has been working really hard on how to present ancillary products in a more clear, concise and understandable way on the website so peoplewill really clearly understand what their options are. And also in the bundling initiative that we launched for the end of last year where we're puttingproducts together so it makes it easier for customers to be able to click on a bundled product. And we're seeing nice uptake on that, particularlyon Avis.com. So we've got some work to do. It's more and more people move to mobile apps and website, and we're seeing improvement inconversion of customers on our site. More and more bookings are coming from that channel, more and more people buying -- using the prepaidoption as well. We've got to find more ways to be able to offer those products to consumers kind of no matter which device they're going to. Sowe've got some more work to do on the mobile app as well. We're excited by the usage of the mobile app, but we got to make sure that we canoffer ancillary products in a way that people can clearly take advantage of them and do it timely."

And then just one follow-up. If I take the midpoint of your guide for EBITDA price and fleet costs, it implies that while the net of your fleetcost and price should be positive, you're still guiding to margin roughly flat versus '17. I think typically what we've seen in the past is when the net     12     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

I'm not sure if normal means what we saw in the firsthalf or the second half kind of related to that, we're seeing OEMs always talking about, again, reducing sales to other car rental business. Does thissuggests that fleets may have -- may well be tighter in 2018 than they were at least in the second half of 2017? Yes, '17. Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director     Michael, this is Larry. Yes, I certainly hope so. The OEMs have been decreased -- some of the OEMs have been decreasing sales to the fleet industry.We saw that in the '18 buy, and we saw that in the '17 buy as well. When I talked about kind of back to normal, I really mean, I refer back a few yearsago prior to industry issues that some competitors had in the industry as far as over-fleeting or having the wrong mix, which has caused over-fleetingto occur. So we're kind of back to prior to those types of problems in the industry. I feel like we're kind of back to the period before that. Can theyalways get tighter? Sure. And I'm sure every rental car company is working on trying to find those times when they can have their cars during thevalleys as low as they possibly can and the cars during the peak as high as they possibly can to meet that peak. So through our fleet optimizationteam, through the data that we're now being able to integrate into the optimization models. We're just getting more and more sophisticated abouthow we buy our cars, using data and third party data to help us figure out how to buy our cars, when to buy our cars, where to infleet them andwhere to exit them at what -- kind of what stage of their lives to really maximize residual values, you can also be able to have the cars in the marketthat we need them at the time those market peak. As you can imagine, the markets we serve across the United States, that's a very complicatedmodel to work and our guys run these models every day, all day long, to make sure that we're constantly tweaking and changing our fleet to makesure that we try to drive that utilization benefit. We had flat utilization really for the year. And that was actually remarkable. When you think aboutus switching, transitioning in 2017 to go up 10 points in risk-cars over program car. What that means is that you have a lot fewer short-term carsthat you could turn back quickly to bring your fleet levels down and to be able to make that transition and be able to drive flat utilization whenthe majority -- when a much bigger part of your fleet is a longer-term fleet hold. We took a lot of effort by optimization teams and the guys in thefield to really be able to deliver on that. So we're kind of through that end point improvement transition and risk. And now we can go into nextyear with, I'd say we're going into '18 with a risk fleet that is similar to our '17 risk fleet. And that allows us to continue to find us opportunities totry to drive utilization up and the team is very focused on that in '18."

When you talk about 0 to 2% U.S. -- Americas increase in pricing, should we look at that as similar to the fourth quarterwhere it was more like 5% on leisure and flat on commercial?
