In the fourth quarter, we signed approximately 275,000 square feet of leases and saw steady demand for our well located, fully modernized for the21st Century buildings, at our value price point.     2017 leasing volume set a record for us.

3,64388191,EMPIRE STATE REALTY TRUST INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, ESRT",Q4 2017 Empire State Realty Trust Inc Earnings Call,Thomas P. Durels,"Empire State Realty Trust, Inc.",EVP of Real Estate,False,True,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone.     Throughout 2017, I reported that we had steady demand and that led to a record leasing year. Thus far in the first quarter of 2018, we continue tosee steady demand.     We feel really good about our differentiated product type, our price points, our locations and the brokers and tenants we are attracting.     On today's call, I will provide you with an update on our 4 key growth drivers. Review our leasing activity in the fourth quarter and full year, givean overview of our current and future space availabilities and discuss some of our recent redevelopment work.     To make things easier and cut the length of these calls, certain areas of my quarterly update can now be found in our supplemental.     Our fourth quarter numbers reflect further progress on our 4 long-term growth drivers, which are one, upside from signed leases not commencedof $17 million and burn off of free rent of $26 million, which together, total approximately $43 million of contracted growth. Two, lease up ofdeveloped vacant office space of $26 million; three, the mark-to-market on our expiring Manhattan office leases of $18 million; and four, themark-to-market and lease-up of available retail space of $10 million.     Based on these updated numbers, we estimate these drivers will contribute approximately $97 million of revenue growth over the next 5 to 6 yearsDecember 31, 2017. Relative to our trailing 12 months cash NOI of $381 million.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

This included approximately 214,000 squarefeet in our Manhattan office properties, 38,000 square feet in our greater New York metropolitan office properties and 23,000 square feet of retail.     This brings our 2017 total to 167 new and renewal leases for a company record of approximately 1.29 million square feet.     Significant office leases signed during the quarter include Universal Music Group, PVH, Hoguet Newman and MSG ventures.     And subsequent to quarter end, we signed a new office lease with Uber for a full floor of approximately 35,000 square feet at 1400 Broadway. Tomake this lease, the prior tenant made payments to terminate its lease early, which allowed us to avoid future downtime and capture revenuewhile we achieved a 9% positive mark-to-market increase of starting rent over prior fully escalated rent.     Our redevelopment strategy allows us to continue to capture healthy rental growth spreads. During the fourth quarter, rental rates on new andrenewal leases across our entire portfolio were 26.8% higher on a cash basis compared to prior escalated rents.     And that our Manhattan office properties, we signed new leases at positive rent spread of 33.9%.     For this quarter and going forward, we will provide detail on our vacancy in our supplemental.     Here are some highlights for our portfolio as of December 31 of 2017.     We had a net total of 792,000 square feet of unleased space, which is comprised of Manhattan office vacancy of 595,000 square feet.     Retail vacancy of 44,000 square feet and greater New York metropolitan office vacancy of 153,000 square feet.     Of the 595,000 square feet of unleased Manhattan office space, approximately 425,000 square feet is consolidated and redeveloped prebuilt andwhite-boxed space ready for lease up.     Within our Manhattan office portfolio, we currently have available 8 full floors ranging in size from 8,500 square feet to our largest single floor of42,000 square feet.     These 8 floors total 145,000 square feet and include 3 floors at 111 West 33rd Street, 2 floors at 250 West 57th Street and 1 floor each at 1350Broadway, 1400 Broadway and 1 Grand Central Place.     We expect our occupancy will go up and down as we continue our strategy to deliver derisked embedded growth and we vacate and consolidatespaces and redevelop and release those spaces at higher rents to get better tenants.     In 2018, we expect to vacate an additional 700,000 square feet. Roughly 2/3 of this space is taken offline in the first half of 2018.     We expect year-end occupancy to be lower than when we started the year.     As we have shown quarter-over-quarter when we redevelop, we lease up at materially higher rents.     This space represents in place fully escalated rents of $49.34 per square foot portfolio wide. Similar to the recent lease with Uber, we are also activelyworking on opportunities to take back underutilized space that we can in turn lease directly to new or expanding tenants at higher rents.     As always, there is a timing lag between the move outs of existing tenants and when new leases commence, which impacts revenue.     In addition, there is a timing lag between legal commencement and GAAP revenue recognition.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

We signed a significantly lease with T.J. Maxx for a 19,000 square-foot full floor expansion and overall lease extensionat 250 West 57th Street during the fourth quarter, and T.J. Maxx now leases a total of 47,000 square feet.     Our street retail portfolio located in high-traffic areas with excellent -- within excellent submarkets is 92% occupied and 93.9% leased and strongexecution on leasing results delivered by our team has positioned us well with only 8% of our retail spaces expiring in the next 2 years.     As previously announced at the Empire State building. For the first time since the buildings opening, a gut redevelopment of all retail space isunderway.     The first phase on 33rd Street has been successfully completed, will be vacated and 100% released approximately 21,000 square feet at grade and9,200 square feet on the second floor to Walgreens, Juice Press, Starbucks, Sushi-teria, Chopped, STATE Grill and Bar and most recently Tacombi.     Phase II on the 34th Street is in progress where we have vacant and are currently marketing 7,900 square feet on grade and 18,000 square feet ofcontiguous concourse space.     By December 31 of 2019, we anticipate we will have another 6,700 square feet at grade, 12,000 square feet on concourse and 5,000 square feet onthe second floor vacant for redevelopment.     As we have stated before, our new 34th Street Observatory entrance will bring 4 million plus visitors annually, past our stores there and enhancethe value of all of our 34th Street retail space.     We remain very confident about our leasing pipeline and in our team's ability to execute. Demand for a well-located and amenity-rich propertiesis steady as we continue our proven strategy to consolidate, vacate and deliver redeveloped space and lease to new, better credit tenants at higherrents.     It's a reminder, please remember to review our supplemental for information historically provided in this call.     Now I'll turn the call over to David Karp. David?"
4,64388191,EMPIRE STATE REALTY TRUST INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, ESRT",Q4 2017 Empire State Realty Trust Inc Earnings Call,David A. Karp,"Empire State Realty Trust, Inc.",Executive VP & CFO,False,True,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone.     For the fourth quarter, we reported Core FFO of $74.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share.     Cash NOI was $99.7 million, up 2.5% from the prior-year period.     For the full year 2017, Core FFO was $286.9 million or $0.96 per diluted share, which includes approximately $0.045 per diluted share of leasetermination income. This was partially offset by the right-off of straight line rent receivables associated with the terminated leases of approximately$0.05 per share. And of course we have reduction in rental revenue from these terminated leases until such time as revenue commences onreplacement leases.     Cash NOI was $381 million, up 7% from the prior-year period.     In the first quarter of 2017, we changed our revenue recognition practices for leases in which the tenant constructs tenant improvements in whichwe share the funding obligation.     We recognize rental revenue at the earlier of cash rent commencement or completion of tenant improvements.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 672                Previously, we started rental revenue recognition when the lease legally commenced.     This new accounting practice resulted in approximately $1.6 million less revenue for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to the practice in place forthe prior-year period.     This practice does not represent a reduction in lease revenue but does represent a delay in the GAAP commencement date for new leases, whichwill continue to have an impact into 2018 and beyond.     This quarter, we added to our supplemental disclosure to assist the investment community to model better our business.     Specifically, we now break out the current year's lease expirations by quarter. We reformatted our quarterly NOI, cash NOI and leasing activity datainto a consolidated growing 5 quarter format for easier trend analysis. We added the number and the impact of bad weather days on Observatoryattendance.     We provided a detailed schedule of signed leases not commenced and we have added in the detail vacancy breakdown Tom cited earlier.     Moving to our Observatory operations. Revenue for the fourth quarter 2017 declined 2.4% to $32.9 million from the prior-year period.     Supported by lower operating expenses, NOI was $25.7 million essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter 2016.     The Observatory hosted approximately 1.01 million visitors in the fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of 5.1% compared to the fourth quarter 2016.     For the full year 2017, the Observatory hosted approximately 4.05 million visitors, down 4.6% compared to the prior-year period.     Observatory revenue was $127.1 million, up 1.8% compared to the prior-year period while net operating income grew 2% to $96.8 million fromthe prior-year period.     As a reminder, we always look at the Observatory's results on a holistic annual basis.     Keeping that perspective, we are pleased with the revenue and NOI improvement we reported in 2017.     A combination of active revenue management through ticket price increases, dynamic pricing, mix improvement and new visitor offerings suchas the AM/PM experience along with expense management offset the impact of fewer visitors.     In connection with the elevator modernization at the Empire State Building, the elevator servicing the 102nd floor will be impacted with the resultof the 102nd floor Observatory will be closed to visitors for the first quarter of 2018.     As a point of reference, sales for the 102nd floor were approximately $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.     Turning to our broadcast business. As we discussed last quarter, we have essentially concluded our negotiations with current operators.     Based on the agreements we have completed and which we have discussed previously, we expect that our broadcast revenue inclusive of tenantreimbursements will be reduced from the current annualized revenue run rate of $19.4 million to a stabilized level of approximately $15 million.     The revenue impact from renewals and non-renewals will phase in during 2018 as detailed in the supplemental.     Moving to our balance sheet, our low leverage joint venture free and flexible balance sheet, including significant cash on hand, remains adifferentiating and competitive advantage for us in any market environment.     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 673                During the quarter, we considered market conditions and made a strategic decision to enter into an agreement to issue $450 million of seniorunsecured notes via a private placement.     The notes consist of 3 series with 10-, 12- and 15-year tenures, all with coupons in the 4% to 4.5% range.     The 10-year series was issued in December 2017 and the remaining 2 series will be funded in March 2018.     We will use the net proceeds from these issuances to repay the 111 West 33rd Street and 1350 Broadway mortgage indebtedness before thematurity dates in early April 2018, and to maintain cash balances.     We believe that the ability to take care of opportunity for long-term value creation for shareholders outweighs the short-term cost.     In January 2018, we increased the mortgage debt on 1333 Broadway from $66.6 million to $160 million due February 2033 with interest fixed at4.21%.     A portion of this increase was applied to release the $75.8 million mortgage lien on 1400 Broadway.     These recent financing activities combined with the mortgage refinancing completed earlier in 2017 and our interest rate hedges will addapproximately $12 million or $0.04 per fully diluted share to our 2018 interest expense as compared with 2017.     With the private placement and subsequent mortgage refinancing, we're very pleased to have accomplished several important objectives: first,we've completely addressed our 2018 mortgage maturities. Our debt maturities are well laddered with only a single $250 million issue maturingbefore 2022.     We made a deliberate decision to go long, resulting in an extension of our weighted average maturities to 6.2 years as of year-end.     With the closing of the 1333 Broadway refinance and the funding of the 12 and 15-year tranches of the private placement in March 2018, ourweighted average maturity will further increase to 8.9 years.     Second, we reinforced and expanded our lender relationships with 4 leading life insurance companies.     Lastly, we enhanced our cash balance with these financing transactions leaving us well positioned with liquidity and capacity for redevelopmentand external growth opportunities.     As of December 31, 2017, the company has total debt outstanding of approximately $1.7 billion. The debt has a weighted average interest rate of4.05%. None of our outstanding debt has variable rates.     The company's consolidated net debt to total market capitalization was approximately 16.6% and consolidated net debt to EBITDA was 3.5x.     We have the lowest leverage in the office suite sector and at quarter end hold cash and cash equivalents of $464.3 million.     As we look ahead to 2018, let me provide some further perspective.     As Tom mentioned, as part of our redevelopment program, we currently expect to vacate 700,000 square feet in 2018, which will reduce occupancyduring the year.     In total, this space represents about $34.5 million of annual revenue and we expect roughly 2/3 of this space to be taken offline in the first half ofthe year.     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Further, we have $26 million of annualized free rent of which $13 million will be realized in 2018 with the majority of the balance in 2019.     Consistent with what we have always said and what you have heard from the team today, the additional vacancy and the impact on revenue in2018 is inherent in our strategic plan to deliver embedded derisk growth and shareholder value.     With that, I would like to open the call for your questions. Operator?     (technical difficulty)"

This is Tony Malkin here.     I'll take this opportunity to make a couple of comments if I may. First of all, aside from the conference call, I want to thank the team for the workon the update that we've provided, sorry for the glitch. We just finished our fourth year as a public company. As I look back, I'm very happy withwhat we have accomplished. We've done exactly what we have said we would do since inception. We have vacated and modernized the New Yorkportfolio for the 21st century, redeveloped our spaces and leased at outsized spreads to better tenants on longer lease terms at higher rents. Weare differentiated from our peers and our markets and in our segment. We have delivered outsized growth through our embedded, deriskedopportunities within our portfolio. And as the team has laid out, we have more to deliver over the next few years.     Along the way, we have created a best-in-class balance sheet with ample liquidity and flexibility to take advantage of external growth when wesee something on which we want to act. We've also built our disclosure to investors and the analyst community and have a truly capable teambuilt around the culture of hard work, service and accountability. Our portfolio is solidly in its own category by combination of quality, price pointand locations. 2018 sets the stage for more of our internal growth story.     We are going to vacate a lot of space, redevelop it and we believe the steady demand we see will allow us to execute as we have to date withmarket and sector-leading leasing spreads.     Looking forward, we are fully engaged and I personally am very excited with our position in growth prospects internally and our ability to takeadvantage of external growth.     Again, I apologize for the interruption. Maybe if we're lucky, we'll be able to get to questions now."

We have significant cash as you know and including our undrawn creditfacility and as we think about deploying it, we're going to continue to measure investment return on that capital versus the returns we're gettingon the redevelopment of our portfolio and as you know our cash NOI in our business grew by 7% in 2017 over the prior year. So we're still gettingvery good growth. We still have about 1 million -- close to 1 million square feet to redevelop in the portfolio and we're going to continue to remainpatient and disciplined. If you see something in the external markets that is attractive relative to the internal return opportunities that we're gettingon our own portfolio, we're going to take action but we're going to continue to be patient."

So in short though, the cash we have on our balancesheet, our primary objective with that the flexibility we have in our balance sheet, the low leverage we have on our balance sheet, the primaryobjective is directed towards external growth. And our focus remains on growing the business, either through individual acquisitions or privateor public M&A. And that's at least the sharp -- the bright shiny penny when we talk about external growth and when we talk about M&A, so I thinkJohn's comments are very focused on discipline as they should be.

Durels,"Empire State Realty Trust, Inc.",EVP of Real Estate,True,False,"John, this is Tom. Out of the 700,000 square feet that we expect to vacate in 2018. As a reminder, the in-place fully escalated rent on that is about$49 per square foot that represents an opportunity for significant mark-to-market. About 520,000 square feet is in our Manhattan office portfolio.The balance is part of the retail redevelopment on 34th Street on Empire State Building and our greater New York metropolitan office portfolio.So out of the 520,000 square feet that we are vacating in '18 in our Manhattan office portfolio, we'll redevelop about 300,000 square feet of that.As to cost, as we've said before depending on whether we build space with a cap contribution following a white box or build a prebuild, those allin cost including base building, which is a onetime expense, TI, whether it be a contribution or the build out of a prebuilt and leasing commissioncan range between $180 to $210 per square foot, all in."

To date, we spent $36 million on the Observatory capital projects andas we have said in the past, we expect that project over the 3 year time horizon commencing in mid-2017 when we started the project throughthe end to run a total of approximately $150 million."

And then regarding the Observatory, I think you said that you're going to go down from $19.4 million in net total growth annualized rentdown to about $15 million run rate. Essentially, you've got $5 million of lease -- of annualized rent expiring at '18. Is this another way of saying thatexpect all of the remaining $15 million to go away as these leases expire? Or from '19 on, can you expect to maintain a $15 million run rate indefinitely?"

We project as you can see in our supplement that with rollovers, we'll get toapproximately $15 million of annual run rate by the end of the year and what we're saying is that we believe that is a reasonable stabilized run ratefor that business going forward. In other words, that's where we end up at the $15 million rate."

And I'm not referring about tourists from Canada. The U.S. brand as a destinationfor tourism is definitely damaged by the rhetoric out of DC. And that hurt us in 2017, it hurt the whole industry. I do think that it's best to take alook at what the hotel association and other entities, which have more to say on this subject than we would undertake to go into on this call haveto say. But in the meantime, for us, there is a reduction in cross-border and -- we get a little tired I think in the end. We're putting the weatherinformation in the supplemental because to some degree, I feel like we're a retailer talking about coat sales, you know? And I don't want to overdoit. In the end, we look at these things holistically, did we have worse weather in 2017 on specific dates? Yes, although there may have been fewerbad weather days. Overall, we got specifically hit very hard with 0 visibility during peak periods in August where we had just terrible weather. Butin the end, the overall trend in 2017 was not positive for cross boarder visitors and that's the majority of our visitors to the Empire State Building."

The lease will commence this year and then they're going to a free rent period.

There is -- as Tom has mentioned,there is a lot of space coming offline and we've tried to quantify what that impact will be in terms of the lost revenue associated with the spacethat goes down and is offset by the signed leases not commenced and the burn off of free rent that we have to backfill that. But I think we've alsoindicated that our occupancy -- we do expect our occupancy to drop at the end of the year as compared to the beginning of the year. So it is a veryactive year for us but it's nothing unusual and it's consistent with what we've been saying all along that our occupancy will go up and down andthat we'll be taking space offline, we'll be reinvesting with it all towards the end goal of substantially increasing our recurring revenues as well asenhancing our total shareholder value."

Just to add to that, it is central to our thesis from the moment of the conception of this company that we had a tremendous amount oftenancy, which was the vast, vast, vast majority of it was undesirable small low-credit short-term leases and unable to pay better rents and manyof them unable to pay the rents that they were contracted to make payment. In order for us to redevelop the space, we must vacate the space.That's a basic fact of life. And we view 2018 as an important year for our growth.

We have given the staton how much we expect to vacate in that year and then our role in the following years is rather modest. So we view 2018 as a big year of executionfor us. But with -- coming off the year at 1.3 million square feet of leasing, which is a record year for us in 2017 and going into the first quarter, wehave solid activity and absolute conviction in our strategy, we continue to build value as we execute on that strategy and I feel good about theactivity we have for our product and our locations and price point.

Just 1 other point, again if you look at our investor presentation, we have a slide in there, which sets forth -- it doesn't setforth what we're vacating but it does set forth what we expect to redevelop. And if you -- and this is on Page 16 I believe of the investor deck andwe show that in 2018, we've got a fair amount of redevelopment and you compare -- we're showing 225,000 square feet roughly as redevelopmentin 2018 and then we look out over subsequent years, 2019, that drops down to 90,000 and 2020 about 95,000.

There will be points in time in which different parts of the Observatory, which you presently walk through are not availabledue to construction. However, the 86th floor outside deck will remain open 100% throughout the entire construction period. And the reason the102nd floor elevator is offline now is because between January 1 and Easter is our slowest period. So working with [Otis], we're getting that workdone so we're open before I peak periods resume.

First, no question with the big growth relocation is coming to Hudson Yards that there's going to be bigvacancies in the office world and also that there is going to be big dollars needed to take those tired buildings up to current standard and you guysare obviously good at that but so are a lot of people. How does that get underwritten? What sort of stabilize yield on cost do you think is expectedfor those kind of deals? That's 1 question. And then the second question is I think you were very public on the upcoming Armageddon in the retailworld and Street retail in Manhattan. Do you have any updates on that?"
53,64388191,EMPIRE STATE REALTY TRUST INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, ESRT",Q4 2017 Empire State Realty Trust Inc Earnings Call,Anthony E. Malkin,"Empire State Realty Trust, Inc.",Chairman & CEO,True,False,"Well, what I might do is as much as I'd like to talk about other people's return needs on redevelopment is to say just that from my own perspective,we know we're making a 10% overall -- 10% to slightly higher when we reinvest in our own properties on a ROI basis, not an IRR basis. And that wehave seen capital markets deploy capital at what we think are much lower IRR's let alone ROIs. So I do think that with this redevelopment opportunity,look, we've seen many landlords today not improve their buildings or may be put in a new lobby instead of doing anything fairly fundamental.And lease frankly, to secondary tenants at lower rents and give away much higher concession packages. And we don't think that, that is a goodstrategy. However, when you look at their balance sheets particularly some of the public ones, they're not in a position really to do more. That'swhat they can afford to do. And I think that there are probably people in the private market who will be looking at that as well. It's difficult to payvery high prices and then have money set aside to do meaningful upgrades to the buildings. End of story. So our hope is that we have higherinterest rates with people less able to plow on leverage, with the skills needed in order to do this kind of work that, that will all combine to ourbenefit from a competitive perspective and also right down to our benefit from a potential yield perspective. I'm going to ask Tom Durels to makea couple of comments on retail just from what we're seeing. Because I do believe that this Armageddon as it were -- I don't think it's coming. I thinka, we're in it. But I do think it's selective in nature. And I think it's worthwhile just to talk a little bit about what we see as far as better locations versusnon-good locations and what's happening in the market place with retail and then I'll have a comment or 2."

If I could take a step back and look what we've accomplished aswe set forth strategies to release our space -- our retail space at 57th Street, Times Square South, 34th Street and the Empire State Building, we setwith the strategy to redevelop all of our street front of 57th Street where we're 100% released 61,000 square feet to tenants like T.J. Maxx, HSBC,AT&T, Starbucks, most recently with the expansion of T.J. Maxx that 61,000 square feet is now on 4 floors fully leased. We've leased all of ouravailabilities on Broadway. You look at the transformation of that submarket and the influx of interesting food and retailers, we leased all of ourspace at 112 West 34th Street and all of our 33rd Street to interesting food users. So now we're focused on our 34th Street frontage at Empire StateBuilding. And I feel very good about the product that we have and retail is going to go where there is pedestrian street traffic and we have tremendousstreet traffic obviously on 34th Street."

Malkin,"Empire State Realty Trust, Inc.",Chairman & CEO,True,False,"In short, John, we know Sephora per square foot basis is one of their, if not, their top per square foot floor in North America -- store in North America.Target is doing great. Foot Locker is doing great. So retail is not dead but there is too much retail in places, which don't matter and then there areplaces where there are certain aspects of retail, which don't really matter at all anymore as the industry and that I think is really seen in SOHO, it'sin some of the tourist areas. It doesn't help for the -- for some of these super luxury locations that overseas travel into the U.S. is down. So overall,I think it's not coming, it's here. You're seeing it. And prices are coming way, way, way down. But I think that speaks to demand.     15     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.
