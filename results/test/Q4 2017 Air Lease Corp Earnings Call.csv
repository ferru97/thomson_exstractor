2,64389883,AIR LEASE CORP,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, AL",Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call,John L. Plueger,Air Lease Corporation,"CEO, President & Director",False,True,"Thanks, Mary Liz. Good afternoon to all of you and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to report that Air Lease closed a strong quarter andanother successful year in 2017. Excluding the benefit of favorable tax reform, ALC achieved diluted earnings per share of $1.06 for the fourthquarter, up 19% from the same period of 2016, and ALC's diluted EPS was $3.65 for the full year, up 6% from the full year 2016.     Including the positive impact of tax reform, for the fourth quarter, we're reporting diluted EPS of $4.22, including $3.16 per diluted share, due tothe remeasurement of our deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As a result of tax reform, ALC's effective tax rate will beapproximately 22% going forward, a decrease from our historical effective tax rate of 35.5%. This means that 38% more of ALC's pretax earningswill hit the bottom line, thereby building shareholder equity faster than previously planned.     As we look around the marketplace, we see good opportunities to deploy this capital to generate strong returns for our shareholders, in line withour current returns. ALC achieved a number of milestones in 2017. To start, Air Lease now has exceeded $15 billion in total assets, up 12% from$14 billion in 2016, and up almost 70% in the past five years. Total revenues exceeded $1.5 billion for the first time in 2017, up 7% year-over-yearalone and up more than 75% over the past five years.     Since inception, just eight years ago, our platform has grown to almost 300 aircraft owned and managed by ALC today. This growth has beenachieved with a focus on profitability and shareholder returns in mind, and without sacrifice to our profit margins. In fact, over the last four years,ALC has averaged an adjusted pretax margin of 42%. IATA reported just earlier this month that, in 2017, global passenger traffic rose 7.6% comparedto 2016, yet again, well above the 10-year average annual growth rate of 5.5%. Load factors were the record calendar year high of 81.4% in 2017.IATA forecasts passenger growth of 6% for 2018, again, above the average annual growth rate. This strong industry backdrop with growing levelsof passenger traffic and an ongoing need to replace aging aircraft has driven all around demand for ALC aircraft. Looking forward with a viewtowards our customers, IATA is projecting an overall growth in global airline profitability for 2018 with slight margin or yield compression forecastedfor the airlines.     Despite this slight expected compression, we believe the industry continues to be in relatively good shape and envision no change in demandgoing forward.     Over the fourth quarter, ALC delivered 12 aircraft, including eight new aircraft from our order book and four used aircraft purchased in the secondarymarkets. Included in our new aircraft deliveries was our first 737-8 Max to LOT Polish Airlines and A350-900 to Malaysia Airlines.     The demand for new aircraft continues to drive our forward lease placements, which remain at a very robust, 97% through 2019 and now 79%through 2020. So, we are nearly done with placements through 2020. These placements, together with the aircraft we already have on lease, resultin ALC having over $23 billion in committed cash flows. We also profitably sold two aircraft in the fourth quarter, one to ALC's managed business,and one to an airline customer. We see continued demand for the used aircraft in our fleet.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 584                As many of you are aware, over the last three years, ALC sold $2.8 billion worth of aircraft, and as a result, only 10% of our current fleet is comprisedof aircraft over eight years of age, which means we now have fewer candidates for sale. So in 2018, we remain opportunistic as it relates to potentialsales, as we always do, but sitting here today, I can tell you that we anticipate no aircraft sales in the first half of 2018.     As to our sidecar platforms and management businesses, they're all performing well and proceeding on track. They continue to complement ourcore business nicely.     ALC has commitments to purchase over $27 billion worth of aircraft, a total of 368 new aircraft from Airbus and Boeing, with deliveries through2023. ALC's fleet will more than double in size over the next five years as we deliver over 300 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing. We expect 45 of theseaircraft to deliver in 2018, accounting for approximately $3.7 billion of capital expenditures.     As should be no surprise to you, we anticipate further delays in our deliveries from Airbus due to engine issues. So as happened in 2017, there maybe shifts from quarter-to-quarter in CapEx. The commitment table in our 10-K includes deliveries as best as we know them today. Right now, weanticipate 10 A320 or A321 Pratt & Whitney-powered neos accounting for approximately 15% of the year's total CapEx delivering in 2018.     In the wake of these ongoing delays, we continue to help our impacted customers by extending existing leases, offering substitute aircraft andseeking other remedies from the OEMs. The leasing industry and ALC, in particular, shines in its ability to solve problems and smooth over roughspots in the industry, acting as a buffer and stabilizer. And Air Lease does so profitably.     As to other perceived challenges ahead, of course, we're looking at higher interest rates, but fortunately, all of you who followed us know that wehave interest rate adjusters in our lease contracts for forward deliveries, which increased our lease rates as interest rates rise. Additionally, 85% ofour debt is fixed on the long end of our maturity curve with 15% floating more on the short end. We continue to issue prudently in the debt capitalmarkets, enjoying very strong demand on our bond offerings, which Greg Willis will talk to you more about. And as a result, you've seen a continueddrop in our overall cost of funds. So, I believe, we're in good shape as to the interest rate environment. We believe lease rates for the industry willrise over time as a result of interest rate increases.     Equally as important as how we left 2017 is how we enter 2018. And I can tell you, we believe in the strength of our business, and with the tailwindsfrom additional capital available through tax reform, the ALC team proceeds enthusiastically and confidently into the remainder of 2018.     I want to extend our heartfelt thanks to our outstanding team at ALC who delivered our results for 2017. They are quite simply the best in thebusiness.     In conclusion, 2017 was a great year for Air Lease. Accordingly, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share on ouroutstanding common stock for the fourth quarter of 2017.     And with that, let me now turn the call over to our Executive Chairman, Steve Hazy, who will provide further ALC remarks and color on the industry.     Steve, over to you."
3,64389883,AIR LEASE CORP,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, AL",Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call,Steven F. Udvar,Hazy,Air Lease Corporation,False,True,"Thanks, John. That was very good. I echo John's sentiments surrounding Air Lease's strong performance in 2017 and the strong outlook for ourbusiness going forward.     Air Lease is firing on all cylinders consistently, and our team continues to execute on our business plans and deliver outstanding financial andoperating results. The strategy that we envisioned at the inception of the company only eight years ago continues to underpin the strength of theresults you see today. We are continuously setting new milestones as we execute with diligence and focus, and we are now concentrated on thelandscape ahead. How we can best serve our airline customers and generate superior returns to our shareholders.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 585                On the back of a strong 2017, fundamentals in the operating environment continue to be very, very healthy. We have now seen several consecutiveyears of overall global airline profitability. Interest rates and fuel are rising but at a manageable pace. Globally, passenger traffic continues to growahead of our expectations, and the substantial replacement cycle for aircraft is further driving demand for our leases. We see continued demandfrom our customers globally. In Asia, for example, this demand is further validated by IATA's report that passenger traffic in the Asia-Pacific regionincreased 10% in 2017. We're also very pleased to observe that demand out of Europe, specifically, Eastern and Southern Europe, is very strongand grew at a fast clip in 2017. And that continues in the first two months of 2018.     For Europe overall, IATA reported that passenger traffic increased more than 8% year-over-year, with load factors of almost 84%. In the Middle East,there has been incremental need from the LCCs and ULCCs, as we have mentioned in the past few calls, there continues to be an improving airlinepicture in Latin America.     So, despite a few airline bankruptcies in 2017, as in most other years, this is nothing new to our industry, and we believe the operating environmentfor airlines remains healthy. Over the last several years, the aircraft lessor community has used our relationships and knowledge of the marketplaceand the various regions of the world to help propel the industry when airlines are healthy or assist with moving our mobile assets worldwide whenairlines need relief.     Moreover, as key players of scale in the space, we have worked hard to validate the strength of the lessor business model, proving that the rightaircraft assets are a strong source of resilient cash flows. The success that Air Lease and other large lessors have had, together with search for returnsin the low interest rate environment, have resulted in new interest and an emergence of new capital, particularly, in the sale leaseback market.There are few items related to this that I would like to touch on.     Throughout 2017, there were key reminders that the protections built into our lease agreements, the flexibility gains from our largely unsecuredcapital structure are vital. There's no better example of this than the Air Berlin and Monarch situations where we were able to find new lessees forthe aircraft quickly and at no loss to Air Lease. That is largely due to the fact that ALC collected substantial cash security deposits and cash maintenancereserves, and that the aircraft were not encumbered so we could act with maximum speed and efficiency. We continue this discipline going forwardon security deposits, maintenance reserves and very strong return conditions.     Another common misconception is that our airline customers are choosing a lessor solely based on price, but that is unique to the sale leasebackmarkets where ALC is not active as a participant.     I remind you that, often times, we have been working with an airline for years before a lease agreement is signed. And that there are other factorssuch as delivery positions, availability of aircraft, which are two of just many items taken into account when an airline is evaluating an aircraft lease.While we remain very competitive on price, most of our campaigns are not won solely on that factor alone.     Finally, I would like to touch on something John noted, interest rates. We are entering a period of rising rates, and we need to see how this newcapital will behave. Meanwhile, our airlines know that Air Lease is a reliable strong partner. And we know that funding for our mostly non-investmentgrade customer base will rise more quickly than our own cost. So, we would expect this to result in incremental and robust demand for aircraftleases, which, ultimately, provide our airline customers with more flexibility and capital relief. So, in conclusion, our view is that there are blue skiesahead, regardless of some noise in the marketplace.     Air Lease's success is driven off the same fundamentals that allowed us to achieve the level of success we have today. And those are choosing theright aircraft types, placing a solid order book years into the future, including appropriate protections in our agreements and continuing to manageour capital structure smartly and conservatively. The dynamics of the industry will continue to evolve, but it is the very consistency of sticking toALC's founding principles and our strong disciplines that allow us to succeed and be a reliable long-term partner to the airline industry that wealways have been.     And with that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Greg, to provide an update on ALC's financing activities for the quarter.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

4,64389883,AIR LEASE CORP,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, AL",Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call,Gregory B. Willis,Air Lease Corporation,Executive VP & CFO,False,True,"Thank you, Steve. As mentioned earlier, we reported another great quarter, generating diluted earnings per share of $1.06 before the effect of taxreform, which added an additional $3.16 to the quarter. The quarterly results were driven by a number of factors, for which I will spend a fewminutes walking you through the details.     First off, our total revenues increased by 7.6% to $398 million, which was driven by our aircraft activity and our portfolio lease yields remainingconstant. The fourth quarter was our largest quarter of the year in terms of CapEx. Our team purchased 12 aircraft, representing $904 million inCapEx, of which 60% delivered in December. Aircraft sales, trading and other activities increased slightly to $20 million, which included $14.4 millionin gains from the sale of two aircraft and insured losses of two aircraft, as well as $3 million in management fees. Also contributing to the increasein revenues was an increase in overhaul revenue, net of amortization of initial direct costs. The increase stems from the recognition of End of Leaseincome from the Air Berlin and Monarch bankruptcies and is a testament to the strength of our lease security packages. These security packagesprotect us against airline and credit events and are used to offset the impacts of lost revenues during the periods of transitions, shelter us from thecost incurred during these transitions and provide us security against the condition of the aircraft. As we said in the last call, we experienced strongdemand for these aircraft and have executed lease agreements with new airlines.     And as you would expect, we anticipate the remainder of these aircraft will be re-delivered in the first quarter. Accordingly, this End of Lease incomehas more than offset the transition costs that elevated our SG&A in the quarter and compensated us for these aircraft not contributing rentalrevenue in the period, which, in aggregate, represented $7 million.     Transitioning to expenses. First off, SG&A was higher when compared to the prior year and prior quarter. And as I just noted, this is partially a resultof the aircraft transition costs. As you'll recall, SG&A was exceptionally low in the third quarter as there were fewer transitional-related items. It'sworth highlighting that we ended the year with 87 employees with over $15 billion assets. We continue to deliver best-in-class operating efficiencyand expect that our revenue growth will continue to outpace our SG&A growth going forward.     Second, interest expense for the quarter was slightly higher as compared to the third quarter of 2017 as a result of higher debt balances. You willsee, however, that we continue to benefit from a reduction of our composite cost of funds. Our composite cost of funds is now 3.2%, down morethan 6% for the year ended 2016, and our fixed-rate cost is now 3.3%, down more than 100 basis points from 2014 when the 10-year treasury wasat similar levels as it is today.     Transitioning to tax, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017, we recorded a net tax benefit of $354 million in the fourthquarter, resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities at a new statutory rate of 21%. This revaluation increased ALC's equitybase, providing us increased flexibility for opportunistic growth. In addition to the effects of tax reform, we recorded an $11 million tax benefitfrom the utilization of foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 22%, as comparedto around 35.5% historically. Looking forward to 2018, we expect to deliver 45 aircraft from our order book, representing $3.7 billion in capitalexpenditures. We are expecting $440 million in CapEx in Q1, $1.25 billion in Q2, $770 million in Q3 and $1.2 billion in Q4. Consistent with prioryears, these numbers do not include any incremental purchases as this relates to aircraft sales. Consistent with John's comments, we're anticipatingno aircraft sales in the first half of 2018.     Moving to the financing side of the business. Since our last call, we issued $2.3 billion in senior unsecured notes across the curve, issuing 3s, 5s, 7sand 10s. The weighted average cost of these issuances was 3% with the weighted average life of these issuances being 6.4 years. ALC ended 2017with a substantial level of liquidity at $3.2 billion including our four-year revolving credit facility, which stands at $3.9 billion.     Looking ahead, we remain committed to our financing strategies of 80% fixed rate debt, 90% unsecured debt and a debt-to-equity target ratio of2.5:1. As of 12/31/2017, we were at 85% fixed, 95% unsecured and a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.35x. As John noted, revaluing our deferred tax liabilityin the fourth quarter resulted in our debt-to-equity ratio decreasing to 2.35x. However, there's no change to our target leverage ratio of 2.5x. Thisconcludes my review of the results and financing activities of the company. I'll now turn it back to Mary Liz.     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

We have already signed an LOI on a couple of additional aircraft, more are on the way. Andwe continue to work with the manufacturers in accelerating anything forward that we can but, basically, we believe in deployment of that capitalconsistently along the same lines as we deploy the rest of our capital."

And then, I guess a follow up, just curious if you can update us on your views around the supply chain. Some of the OEMs are talkingabout some for their production rate hikes and just curious to hear your updated thoughts there."
10,64389883,AIR LEASE CORP,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, AL",Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call,Steven F. Udvar,Hazy,Air Lease Corporation,True,False,"I think the OEMs are making adjustments based on demand and also on the supply chain's ability to sustain that demand. We've seen increases inthe 787-9, 787-10 production rates. We've seen decreases in the Boeing 777 production rates, leading up to the introduction of the Boeing 777Xplanned for 2020. We've seen reduction in production rates on the A330s, as the A330neo comes online later this year. The A350 production ratesare almost now at 10 a month, so that's the target rate that Airbus has forecast. And on the single aisle airplane category, you see the results thatBoeing and Airbus published in terms of how many units they actually delivered in 2017. And you can just divide that by 12 and see what theaverage output was. There was a surge of deliveries for both companies, Airbus and Boeing, in the December month to get as many aircraft deliveredto their customers. We'll see a much slower level of activity in January and February. But both are working very hard to make some small productionrate increases on a progressive basis and, basically, to cure a problem that they have in that they're overbooked right now on single aisle aircraft.They have more orders for the next three years than they can actually produce. So, you're going to see some reshuffling of some deliveries by someairlines. You'll see decelerations, you'll see some postponements, you'll see some accelerations like Air Lease. So, I think, overall, it's a pretty balancedequation."

In terms of anything else that's for sale, I think our answer is, as it always is, we always take alook, and if we see that there's any strategic advantages beyond just bulk purchases of fleets or aircraft, we will act accordingly. But so far, we likeour organic growth and anything that we would do from an M&A perspective, comes with a lot of trade-offs and we look at those trade-offs.

I want to ask you about the new midsized aircraft type that could potentially launch from Boeing. And I washoping to get your thoughts on whether you would expect a launch potentially this year at an air show or if you think it has come down the roadand whether or not you've thought about any launch customers being lessors relative to airline customers?

Boeing would love nothing more than for Air Lease to be a launch customer. Look, for the last five or six years, we've been deeply, and in greatdetail, engaged with Boeing on defining what is the optimal aircraft size and capability, because they do have a gap between the 737 and the 787,an airplane that could replace 757, 767, some of the older smaller widebody aircraft. And I think Boeing is going through a continued refinementof that definition. They're also looking very closely internally as to what the cost of implementing such a program, and then coming up with aneconomical pricing formula that the airlines and the leasing community can actually afford and justify. So that process is ongoing. I know thatBoeing had a lot of resources dedicated to this. But we're just not in the position to make any predictions whether it would be launched at the airshow this year or next year or later this year. It's all got to come together. The business case has to come together for Boeing. The supply chain hasto be properly lined up to avoid the catastrophes of the 787 startup. It's got to be affordable. It has to be an airplane that's capable of filling thosegaps that I mentioned earlier. And it has to be an attractive economic proposition for the lessors and the airlines. And when all those things aresatisfied, then we would hope to see progress. But we just don't see that in the next couple of months. I mean this is a very ambitious undertakingand with lots of moving pieces. And just keep your eyes and ears open to developments."

Just one quick follow-up question. We know we've talked in the past about low-cost,long-haul operators and the disruptive threat they can kind of pose over the Atlantic. Since we've had that conversation, Norwegian, in particular,has seen losses increase and part of that has obviously been driven by the Transatlantic activity. My question is, have you guys thought about kindof that business model having changed over the past several months and years? Or are you still optimistic on that business model and is that anarea where Air Lease wants to increasingly be exposed to?     9     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Plueger,Air Lease Corporation,"CEO, President & Director",True,False,"Yes, well, look I understand your question, and it's always been a classic question about the long-haul low-cost model. But truthfully, we think thattrain has left the station. While there may be property lease squeezes in Norwegian, from a macro perspective, whether a low-cost, long-hauloperator is formed or birth from a legacy carrier, like we have examples of today, or whether it's a standalone Norwegian, there's just too manyexamples. And folding into those examples, even using single aisle aircraft like a number of carriers are doing across the Atlantic, and you pointedout, we believe the long-haul, low-cost model is probably here to stay."

Udvar,Hazy,Air Lease Corporation,True,False,"You do have to observe, however, that the North Atlantic market is very seasonal. It's highly seasonal. So, a long-haul, low-cost operator doesn'thave a network balance to offset some of that degradation in traffic in the winter months, it's going to have issues in the fourth and the first quarter.So, what we'll see is some of these airlines will make adjustments to perhaps capture North, South traffic or entry into the Caribbean or other waysof sort of neutralizing those seasonalities. But -- because when you have a very high capital cost airplane flying 400 hours a month, and you'reflying at a 50% or 60% load factor, there's no way to make money. So, these airlines will have to figure out ways of using those assets, year-roundon an efficient basis. Now what we've seen in other parts of the world, like AirAsia X and Jetstar, which is owned by Qantas, those airlines are nowprofitable on a year-round basis because they have -- they've been around longer, and they've made adjustments to the way they operate theirnetworks. So, we do see some light at the end of the tunnel but Norwegian definitely has challenges. We don't have any aircraft there. But they'llhave to deal with these realities of the market place."

So maybe a couple of things. First, if you can give us a flavor of how quickly should westart to see, maybe lease rates rise. Rental income was strong in this quarter. Just kind of wanted to get a sense for that. And then, broadly speakingfrom your experience, how does rates rising affect how airlines think about the attractiveness of leasing versus other types of aircraft financing?And then, on lessor competition, I'm wondering what you've seen in the past for how rising rates affects competition. You've heard of somecompetitors with liquidity issues, maybe they funded short. And so, you've alluded to ALC being a reliable partner, and so how do you think aboutthe other competition going forward?"

On our new delivering airplanes that have interest rate adjusters, we're seeing the impactsof a rising rate environment show up today, right. So as a function of those adjusters, rates rise, our lease rates adjust at delivery. So, we are definitelyseeing the benefit of those adjusters.     10     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

So just -- I guess how airlines view the attractiveness of leasing versus other types of financing and rising rates. And then also, how doesother aircraft -- the lessor competition that you see out there, how do they behave in a rising rate environment, particularly as some of them mightnot have much fund."

As compared to alternative forms of financing, airlines that finance classically through their balance sheet, whether it's double ATC or whateverfinancing structure, those costs are going to go up. And I think we made the point earlier that most of our customers are noninvestment gradecredits. And so, we believe their interest rate cost will probably go up at a faster clip than ours will as an investment grade company. So, we seethat actually as a net positive in how airlines view the operating lease specifically. Competitively, everyone pays for money. I don't care whereyou're from. And so, I really see everybody on a more equal playing field there with the cost of funds going up. That's a consequence that allfinanciers and lessors have to have. I think the advantage that we have is with our investment grade credit, we're going to continue to enjoy abenefit as to what our -- most of our customers could borrow at."

They have CapEx targets, they like to deploy capital, and if there's otheropportunities that are more attractive to them, they're going to deploy that capital elsewhere.

And even though, on paper, it's the lowest seat mile cost, single-aisle airplane, it didn't sell verywell. I think there are opportunities for Airbus to make some relatively small improvements to the A321neo.

Can you just talk about the overall used aircraft market? Do you think it's more of a buyer or a seller's markettoday? It seems like with some of the actions you're taking here in the first half of the year, it might be more of a -- maybe more of a buyer's market,but would just love your thoughts."
69,64389883,AIR LEASE CORP,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, AL",Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call,John L. Plueger,Air Lease Corporation,"CEO, President & Director",True,False,"No. We still have more people coming to us to buy airplanes than, frankly, we have to sell. What I'm trying to say in our remarks is, with the successof a transfer of a number of midlife aircraft at Thunderbolt that we did last year, we have just under 10% of our aircraft left in our fleet that are overeight years of age. And we adhere to our founding principles which is we like to enjoy the aircraft about the first 1/3 of its useful life or 25 years, sothat's eight-plus years and change. So I would say, no, I would say, it is still a seller's market for aircraft as evidenced by everybody that keeps comingto us and others for a robust demand of all aircraft. Our -- I think Steve framed it well, we're focusing on growth of our asset base. Because we'reearning good yields, good returns on these products, and we have a little bit of capital now additionally through the benefit of the tax Reform Act.So naturally, we're going to utilize that, grow accordingly. But I would not say -- no, I don't think it's a buyer's market, I think it is still a seller's market."

And then a separate question. As it relates to your comments around just lease yields going up with higher interest rates canyou provide maybe some historical perspective? Did we in fact see some pressure on lease yields over the last several years as interest rates werelow such that, if they reversed, we should see some upward pressure?"
71,64389883,AIR LEASE CORP,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, AL",Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call,Gregory B. Willis,Air Lease Corporation,Executive VP & CFO,True,False,"Yes. In our last Investor Day, we show show our chart of our historical portfolio lease yield over the last five, six years, and it was incredibly consistent.We've done a great job of preserving our lease yields as rates went down. Also it graphs out of our average age and our average lease term to showthat those two key variables were also constant. So we weren't playing with the age or the lease duration. And then as I mentioned earlier, right,we're starting to see upward pressure on our lease rates on our aircraft that are delivering with interest rate adjusters as a function of the currenthigher interest rates environment that we're looking at today, right? But it's also really important to point out on the financing side that the lasttime the 10-year treasury was this high, our fixed-rate financing costs were 100 basis points higher. So we've completed the transition to beinginvestment-grade. We have BBB ratings from S&P, Fitch and an A- from Kroll, and I think we're in a really strong position with 85% of fixed-ratedebt."

And so, to the extent that they do, how do power by the hour contracts change how you think about maintenance costs and maintenancereserves? And then, ultimately, how do you assess maintenance risk of these new technologies coming into the market?"

Plueger,Air Lease Corporation,"CEO, President & Director",True,False,"Well, look, the engine care agreements have actually been there for quite a number of years. And yes, of course the engine OEMs are pushing theseengine care agreements. There's a benefit to us in that it helps our airline customers manage the return, the condition of the engines at return ofthe lease. And we are assured also of the quality maintenance pursuant to delivery of these engines to the OEM shops during the course of thelease. So, it actually is a strength to our residual values. As to the reliability, et cetera, well, things haven't started off really robustly, I would just say.But nevertheless, those things are getting fixed. And most of the engine care programs, properly drafted, put the burden back on the engine guysif there's any reliability or performance degradation issues across the board. So, I would say in a nutshell, it helps us with the residual value of ourassets and I think, it helps our operators because the engine OEMs, it's on their nickel, to replace whatever needs fixing or updating or modifyingin the new technology engines."

Udvar,Hazy,Air Lease Corporation,True,False,"Kristine, one of the things that we're very conscious of and watch very carefully is that these packages are transportable from one airline to another.In other words, if we have a lease on an airline and it goes for, say, seven or eight years, the airline has paid in a certain amount of reserves to theengine supplier under this total care program and then we lease the aircraft to another airline, so we want to make sure that those funds that havebeen paid in and have not been utilized by the OEMs are available to the next airline when they have shop visits and other maintenance activitythat's covered under the total care agreement. So that's something that's special and unique to the leasing community to make sure that the assetscontinue to have the benefit of whatever funding went in there to support the engines."

So, for the aircraft that are under power by the hour, does that mean that the lessee pays directly to the engine OEMs or do they still gothrough your maintenance reserves and your balance sheet? And then second, what percent of your total aircraft order will be under power bythe hour?"

Plueger,Air Lease Corporation,"CEO, President & Director",True,False,"Well, let me just start with the first part. We have both. So, three large engine providers, Pratt, Rolls and GE. We have both types of, agreements.We have agreements where we are past the reserves and that, at various points, we pass them on to the OEM. We also have --[agreements] wherethe engine care payments go directly to the OEMs. And sometimes, we receive a separate reserve for, what's called LLPs. So, we have all kinds ofagreements. I have no idea what -- I mean we have 360 some odd airplanes on our forward orders which we have today. I have no idea whatpercentage from that total is going to be covered under engine care programs. I mean just sitting here today, that is the business model of theengine manufacturers. And by the way, that model transfers risk to them as I indicated in my comments. So, it's hard for us to sit here and say howfar forward our order book will be. Not all, not all of our customers, are using the engine care program. So, I would say the majority of the aircraft,     16     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Udvar,Hazy,Air Lease Corporation,True,False,"Yes, the other thing is that as more and more airlines set up their own shops and their own capability to maintain and overhaul these engines, thenit gives other airline operators that could potentially normally sign up for a total care agreement with the manufacturer, they might then shoparound between the OEM's program and airlines that will offer fixed price contracts to do a shop visit. So as more and more shops are able to handlethese engines, these new technology engines that could actually be some headwinds toward an airline, joining this program because they'll havevarious alternatives where to send the engines for heavy maintenance. So, we're seeing headwinds and tailwinds at the same time going forward."
