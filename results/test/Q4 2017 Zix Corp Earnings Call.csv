2,64389962,ZIX CORP,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ZIXI",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,David J. Wagner,Zix Corporation,"CEO, President and Director",False,True,"Thank you, Geoff. Good afternoon and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We finished 2017 with a strong financial performance, deliveringon our commitment to profitable growth. We grew revenue in 2017 by 9%, adjusted EBITDA by 8% and cash flow from operations by 19% to $18.2million.     The successful introduction of ZixProtect and ZixArchive and our cloud-based e-mail protection bundle contributed to these strong results, andwe are pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the market for these solutions.     The fourth quarter delivered an acceleration of the trends that we've been seeing with our customers moving to the cloud and often preferring abundled offering. New first-year orders from ZixProtect more than doubled sequentially, while new first year orders from ZixArchive more thanquadrupled over the same period. These new solutions are increasingly being delivered as an e-mail protection bundle, enabling us to attract newcustomers, and to sell deeper into our installed base.     Quarter-over-quarter, our attach rates for ZixProtect more than doubled to almost 3%, and new first year orders of ZixProtect and ZixArchiveaccounted for over 20% of our total new first year orders in the quarter.     These results demonstrate our ability to successfully execute on our cross-selling initiatives and validate our strategy of transitioning to a broadere-mail security provider from our strength as a leader in encryption. In a market environment that's being driven by the migration of e-mail to thecloud and, at the same time, that is being targeted by hackers as the #1 threat vector, customers are searching for an e-mail protection solutionlike Zix that assures security and compliance in a cloud-based easy-to-use service with outstanding customer support.     We are building the Zix brand and our core strengths to become one of the clear choices for a robust and fully-featured email security bundle.We're still in the early stages of executing our bundling strategy, but the results are beginning to speak for themselves.     Let me step back for a moment though. 2017 was about more than just launching our bundled solutions to address a significantly larger totaladdressable market. It was also about refining who Zix is and, more importantly, what Zix can be. Leveraging more than 2 decades of marketleadership and expertise in the e-mail encryption space, we've successfully expanded our horizon from just e-mail encryption to become one ofthe preeminent providers for a broader set of e-mail security solutions.     Our rebranding at the beginning of the year laid the foundation for our new identify and reaffirmed our commitment to our customers. We createdour customer success team to better serve our customers throughout all stages of their Zix relationship, ensuring that we deliver even more valueto our customers. Embracing this philosophy of driving more value, we then launched ZixProtect and ZixArchive, significantly expanding ourproduct suite. Along the way, we bolstered our leadership team, enhanced our e-mail encryption capabilities with the acquisition of EMS, andmade significant enhancements to our platform, especially our multitenant cloud solution, which grew 87% year-over-year during the quarter.     With all of these accomplishments, our accelerating momentum with ZixProtect and ZixArchive served as the cherry on top, helping us to end2017 on a high note.     Looking ahead to the new fiscal year, we look forward to extending the 87% year-over-year revenue growth we experienced last year in ourcloud-based encryption product as well as the opportunity to accelerate that success with ZixProtect and ZixArchive.     However, the excess churn due to M&A and competitive pressure is slowing our near-term revenue growth and impacting our 2018 guidance. Thisexcess competitive churn we are experiencing is primarily from our on-premise appliance customers, which now represents about 20% of our ACV,down from 27% of our ACV a year ago.     We believe the success we're seeing with our cloud-based e-mail security solutions position us well for expanding our market position and buildinga foundation for stronger levels of growth and profitability moving forward. Later on today's call, I'll expand on how we're making real progress tomitigate and overcome some of these pressures.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Dave?"
3,64389962,ZIX CORP,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ZIXI",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,David E. Rockvam,Zix Corporation,CFO and VP,False,True,"Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Building on Dave's remarks, Q4 was another strong quarter with regards to our bundling,cross-selling initiatives and moving our customers to the cloud. As ZixProtect and ZixArchive continued to gain traction, we believe we're in solidposition to expand our market share in the broader e-mail data protection space.     Turning to our financial numbers in more detail. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 8% to $16.8 million from $15.6 million in the same quarterlast year. Our Q4 revenue came in at the high-end of our revenue guidance range and also represented our highest level of quarterly revenue forthe 15th quarter in a row. The record revenue was primarily driven by the rapid adoption of our cloud-based hosted encryption solution and thesuccess of our new e-mail protection bundled offerings. We did also benefit from a partner-based account becoming current and some compliancerevenue, which together contributed roughly $200,000 in Q4 revenue.     Looking at fiscal 2017, revenue increased 9% to a record $65.7 million from $60.1 million in the same period last year. 9% growth from 2017 continuesto demonstrate our solid subscription business performance and customer momentum. Our new first year orders for the quarter decreased 7% to$2.5 million compared to $2.7 million in the same quarter last year. As David alluded to earlier, new first-year order were up 119% sequentially forZixProtect, and up 323% sequentially for ZixArchive. While new first year orders as a whole were down year-over-year, we are pleased to see ourcloud-based hosted solution and our bundled offerings making up a bigger percentage of this metric and the new customer wins.     Our adjusted gross profit for the quarter was $13.7 million or 81.4% of total revenue, which is an improvement on a dollar basis from $12.9 millionor 82.7% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016. 81.4% was at the high-end of our adjusted gross margin outlook of 80% to 81%, which weprovided last quarter. Similar to the prior 2 quarters, our adjusted gross margin percentage for Q4 was down year-over-year. This is because weincluded a 100% of Greenview Data's cost while not yet capturing 100% of their revenue, which is expected when purchasing a subscription-basedrevenue company. We continue to expect our adjusted gross margins to remain within this range of 80% to 82% in 2018, as we continue to investto provide best-in-class customer support and operational excellence.     For the full year, adjusted gross profit was $53.5 million or 81.5% of total revenue, which was an improvement on a dollar basis from $49.8 millionor 82.8% of total revenue in 2016. Our adjusted R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.7 million or 16.2% of total revenue comparedto $2.4 million or 15.4% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Greenviewdata in our results versus their absence a year ago. The R&D headcount increase accounts for 100% of the overall increase in R&D as a percentageof sales.     Later in the call, Dave will dive into the exciting advancements to our platform the team has been delivering.     Our adjusted selling and marketing expenses for the quarter were $4.5 million or 26.9% of total revenue compared to $4.7 million or 30.4% of totalrevenue in Q4 of last year. A portion of the decrease in dollars was due to the cost-cutting measures we took in Q4 to better align cost and salesopportunities in 2018. The decrease in selling and marketing as a percentage of sales was primarily, however, due to the increase in revenues forthe year.     For the fourth quarter of 2017, our adjusted general and administrative expenses were $2.3 million or 13.6% of total revenue compared to $1.9million or 12.3% of total revenue reported in Q4 of last year. Similar to the prior quarter, the year-over-year increase was primarily due to the additionof a VP of Corporate Development, our investment in new systems to modernize our business processes and the addition of our Ann Arbor office.The systems upgrade project went live on January 5, and we're starting to see immediate benefits from this upgrade. As we've communicatedbefore, these investments are foundational to our plan to grow the company via our build, partner, buy strategy. Due to the 2017 tax reformlegislation which reduces our corporate tax rate as of January 1, 2018, we had to make a one-time adjustment of $12.5 million to our deferred taxasset balance during the fourth quarter. This adjustment was made to reflect the future effect of the lowering the corporate tax income tax ratefrom 35% to 21%. In combination with those adjustment and other deferred tax expense, we recognized a net non-cash charge of $15.2 millionto our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter and $18.5 million for the full year. It's important to note, however, there's no change to our cash     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

We also don't expect this remeasurement to impact us going forward, and we believe we're still in a good positionto utilize our NOLs through the late 2020s.     On a GAAP basis, we recorded a net loss of $12.9 million or $0.24 per fully diluted share compared to a GAAP net income of $1.9 million or $0.04per diluted share in Q4 of last year. For the full year, GAAP net loss targeted -- totaled $8.1 million or $0.15 per diluted share compared to a GAAPnet income of $5.8 million or $0.11 per fully diluted share in 2016. The decrease for both the quarter and year was largely due to the one-timenon-cash charge of $12.5 million that I mentioned earlier.     Our fourth quarter non-GAAP adjusted net income was $4.5 million or $0.08 per fully diluted share. $0.08 per share was consistent with our guidancefor the quarter, and represents an improvement of $0.01 over the amount we reported in Q4 of last year.     For the full year, non-GAAP adjusted net income was $15.6 million or $0.29 per diluted share. $0.29 per share exceeds our 2017 guidance fornon-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share, and represents a 12% improvement over the amount we reported in 2016.     And finally, our adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2017 totaled $4.9 million, an increase of 8% compared to the $4.5 million we reported in Q4 of last year. Asa percentage of total revenue, adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was 29%, which was consistent with the same quarter last year, and above the previousguidance that we would end the year at 28%.     For the full year, our adjusted EBITDA was $18.2 million, up 8% from 2016 and matching last year's 28% of revenue. Cash flow from operations forthe fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.2 million, up 108% from $2 million we reported in the same quarter last year. For the full year, we generated$18.2 million of operating cash flow, up $2.9 million or 19% from 2016. As a profitable growth company, we're focused on building on this strongcash flow generation, which is made possible due to the 100% subscription nature of our business. Because of our ability to consistently generatethis strong cash flow, we maintained our robust balance sheet with $33 million in cash and no debt.     During the quarter, we also reached a licensing agreement settlement with respect to the IP infringement litigation, which should help free upeven more cash flow going forward.     Turning to our share repurchase program, which the Board of Directors approved in April 2017. During Q4, we repurchased 500,000 shares for anaggregate amount of $2.5 million, at an average share price of $4.95. Under the current program, we are authorized to purchase an additional $6.2million worth of shares as of January 1, 2018, subject to certain conditions. Along with the Board, we continue to evaluate the shareholder returnof buybacks as part of our balanced capital allocation strategy, which we believe should drive higher returns for shareholders, both now and inthe future. I will add, we have repurchased shares in January and February of this year.     CapEx for the quarter was $1.3 million, which included costs associated with our business systems implementation project and normal businesscapital purchases. We expect CapEx for 2018 to be between $2.3 million and $2.7 million, and we expect to have approximately $2.7 million ofdepreciation in 2018.     Our backlog, which represents the dollar value of committed contracts, was $72.6 million as of December 31, 2017, which was down 11% from$81.7 million as of the same date last year. The decrease in backlog in total orders was due to a decrease in our renewal rate from last year's recordlevels as well as the shorter-term commitment associated with the new customer pricing in bundled offerings. As we've mentioned before, we arereducing the financial incentives for customers to select longer-term contracts, which helps us increase our transaction volume and future touchpoints with these customers.     Looking at our deferred revenue, we expect to recognize approximately $45.1 million or 62.2% as revenue over the next 12 months. Similar to theprior 2 quarters, you can see the impact of the shift toward shorter-term contracts when you compare the 62.2% of revenue recognition of deferredover the next 12 months to last year's 57.3%. In other words, the 12-month backlog was up 5% year-over-year.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 200                At the end of the fourth quarter, our ACV, or annual contract value, totaled $67.3 million, up 9% from Q4 of last year. From an industry perspective,our revenue breakdown was 50% from health care, 28% from financial services, 7% from government and 15% from other verticals, all excluding2017 acquisitions.     Before shifting gears to our financial outlook, I would like to touch on the new accounting standard, revenue from contracts with customers, ASC606, which were adopted at the start of the fiscal year starting January 1, 2018. The guidance on today's call and all future calls will conform to thenew ASC 606 accounting standard. While we are still in the final stages of assessing the impact, our current work would suggest that for the fullyear 2018, the new standard will not have any impact on revenue, as Zix has recognized revenue for a number of years as a subscription, which isin compliance with ASC 606. In terms of operating expenses, we expect ASC 606 to have a favorable impact to sales and marketing expense ofapproximately $1.5 million to $2 million for 2018 as we start to amortize commissions of both new and add-on business over the average lengthof customer life.     The result of this change will be lower sales and marketing expenses in current periods by shifting that expense into future periods. And note thatthe new standard has no impact on the calculation and reporting of cash flow. Zix plans to adopt ASC 606 under the modified retrospective standard,and as such, we do plan to publish the details regarding historical impact of this new standard as part of our 10-Q that will be filed in connectionwith our first fiscal quarter of 2018 reporting period.     Now for our first quarter and full year 2018 financial guidance. We currently anticipate revenue for the first quarter to range between $16.6 millionand $16.8 million, representing an increase of 4% to 6% compared to Q1 of last year. We are also forecasting fully diluted GAAP earnings per shareto be between $0.04 and $0.05, and fully diluted non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share to be $0.08. For the full year, we expect revenue to rangebetween $67.5 million and $69 million, which represents an increase of 3% to 5% compared to revenue in fiscal 2017.     We are also forecasting our fully diluted GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.17 and $0.19, and our fully diluted non-GAAP adjusted earningsper share to be $0.32 for fiscal 2018.     With the impact of ASC 606, we are targeting a 2018 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 30% versus 28% in 2016 and 2017.     Our full year revenue guidance reflects the excess churn we experienced in 2017, and the roll-forward impact it is having on our 2018 revenue. Aswe have not fully cleared through all the additional churn in our on-premise appliance customers, our 2018 growth rate is somewhat dampened.However, we continue to be optimistic on our growth potential as we migrate and drive growth from new customers in our hosted and bundledofferings. Both of these solutions performed extremely strong in 2017, and have us excited about the future as we continue to execute on ourprofitable growth plan.     This completes my financial summary. For a more detailed analysis of our financial results, please reference our Form 10-K, which we plan to fileby March 12th. Dave?"
4,64389962,ZIX CORP,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ZIXI",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,David J. Wagner,Zix Corporation,"CEO, President and Director",False,True,"Thank you for the financial overview, Dave. Beginning with this call, we are changing our reporting framework to focus on 3 main growth driversthat more concisely consolidate the 7 pillars we've been using for the past 7 quarters. The 3 growth areas are one, new customer acquisition; two,sales to existing customers through adding on and cross-selling; and three, reducing churn and increasing retention.     I'll now spend the remainder of the call going over our financial performance and progress with respect to each of these 3 growth areas.     In terms of new customer acquisition, we're continuing to secure new customers through our direct sales teams, VARs and MSPs and OEM partners.In the first area, we'll also cover international customer acquisition efforts.     So new customer acquisitions was previously addressed by pillars 1, 2 and 7. Our primary measure of new customer acquisition is through our newfirst-year orders metric. As Dave mentioned earlier, our new first year orders for the quarter were $2.5 million. Although down 7% from the same     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 201                quarter last year, this healthy level of new first year orders was once again driven by our success in winning new customers versus the competition,particularly with our cloud-based solutions.     In fact, 89% of our direct ZixEncrypt deployment in 2017 were hosted, this was up from 67% in 2016, 42% in 2015, and 9% in 2014, demonstratingthe rapid adoption of our cloud-based encryption product. This cloud adoption is especially important as it is where we can best attach additionalservices and it is where our retention rates are the highest.     As previously mentioned, a key part of our sales success in Q4 was the increasing momentum of ZixProtect and ZixArchive. New first year ordersfor these products more than doubled and quadrupled respectively on a sequential basis. As a percentage of total new first year orders, ZixProtectand ZixArchive accounted for more than 20% of the $2.5 million compared to 17% of the $2.1 million in Q3.     In terms of our core encryption product, we did see a year-over-year decline due to reduced contribution from our OEM partners and the changeswe made to our pricing and bundling strategy.     Looking more specifically at new first year orders from new customers, $1.3 million or 54% of our new first year orders in Q4 came from newcustomers. 3 of our top 5 new customer wins during the quarter were for our core ZixEncrypt best-of-breed solution, demonstrating that customerscontinued to value our core encryption solution. Of course, that means 2 of our top 5 new customers in the quarter were for our bundle. We'reespecially pleased with this traction and the fact that we displaced key Gartner Magic Quadrant providers in these accounts, demonstrating thestrength of our bundle in competitive displacement scenarios.     Taking a step back and analyzing our new first year orders during the quarter, 52% came from our direct sales efforts; 41% through VARs and MSPs;5% through our OEM partners; and 2% from web sales. Only 5% from our OEM partners means that we experienced another light contributionfrom that channel. With regards to Cisco, we're still not in a position where we can expect consistent new first-year order contributions from themas a channel and we're working with Cisco to find a new and fresh approach to optimize our work together. With Google, we continued to moveopportunistically, and see a stronger opportunity to engage Gmail, G Suite customers through Google's channel partners, [then] with Google'sdirect sales force.     For the full year of 2017, new first-year orders from our OEM partners decreased to 9% of our new first year orders from 17% in 2016, more thanaccounting for the year-over-year decline in the total new first year orders and the majority of the year-over-year decline in encryption orders.     In 2018, we will be continuing to work with our existing OEM partners to optimize our work together, but we will be placing increasing emphasison our MSP and VAR routes-to-market as we believe that they represent a better go-to-market fit for our expanded solutions set.     More specifically, on April 2, we will launch a new managed service provider program that will allow our MSP partners to access our completebundle from a single interface, including the ability for tiered access to ZixCentral and self-administration of their end users. We are also introducingmonthly billing for our MSP partners that move to the new expanded offering. We're excited about the strong early reception of this new offeringby the partners who are previewing it, and we're optimistic about the potential increase to our business, particularly in the SUB 50 mailbox spaceand Gmail space that had been historically underrepresented in our base.     Turning quickly to our progress on the international front. On our last call, we talked about penetrating the Canadian market through our acquisitionof EMS, which helped us secure 3 of Canada's largest banks. Our on-premise and S/MIME capabilities have been particularly effective in this regard,and we look to leverage these capabilities to expand our business outside the U.S.     Last, but not least, we also signed a distribution agreement and our first reseller in the United Kingdom as we look to take advantage of the growthopportunities in this market with the rollout of GDPR later this year.     Now, turning to our second main growth area, which is additional sales through existing customers, which was previously referred to as pillars 3and 4. In the fourth quarter, approximately 44% of our new first year orders during the quarter came from our installed base, which is just aboveour average of 40% and totaled approximately $1.1 million. In the fourth quarter, we focused heavily on penetrating our installed base with     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Onthe other hand, we had strong success selling ZixProtect and ZixArchive to more than 70 existing customers, totaling approximately $400,000 or35% of our add-on sales.     Looking to the rest of 2018 and beyond, selling additional value to our existing customers will remain a focus. We are pleased with the fact thatZixProtect was nominated as the best e-mail security product by SC Media Awards, a great validation of the strength of our offer, which combinedwith our growing list of reference customers, will help us continue to expand our add-on sales as well as addressing new customer opportunities.     The third and final growth area is reducing churn and increasing retention, which effectively summarizes pillars 5 and 6, pillar 5 being customerretention and pillar 6 being ongoing investment in our products.     Looking back at 2017, we achieved a 100% renewal rate on our new EMS solution, which bolstered our already robust e-mail encryption capabilities.Retention of our cloud-based customers was also well above 90%, contributing to our 87% growth in our most important strategic customersegment. However, retention of our on-premise legacy Gateway customers is lagging, as legacy customers transition to Office 365. In spite of theon-premise headwind, we did achieve 90% total dollar renewal rate for 2017, but we were a couple of hundred basis points below historical levels.     As we have stated, the 2017 shortfall was largely due to M&A activity for 3 health care customers and the impact of Office 365 migrations on ouron-premise customer base. We are working diligently to address the excess churn. In addition to the roadmap deliveries that I will describe later,we have armed our customer success team with best-in-class data-driven tools to help us better understand our customers' current usage to betterassess and predict risk of nonrenewal. Where the risk of nonrenewal is highest, we're giving customer success team tools to address customerconcerns by one, commercially incenting migration to our cloud for on-premise customers; two, delivering enhanced value and simplicity with acompelling bundle of cloud-based e-mail protection solutions; and three, when customers aren't willing or able to move to the cloud, we will worktowards longer-term renewals, especially with on-premise appliance customers.     Migrating our on-premise customers to the cloud is our #1 priority because that is where they become stickier and where they can most easily takeadvantage of the additional services we've added to our product suite. In fact, during 2017, we migrated 200 on-premise and dedicated hostedcustomers to our multitenant standard cloud offer. This is up from 14 migrations for calendar year 2016. So you can see the impact cloud e-mailmigrations are having on our customers and how quickly we are responding.     For the last 18 months, the majority of our R&D roadmap has been dedicated to accelerating our cloud offerings. In particular, we're investing inZixCentral, our cloud-based offering, to bring it the feature parity with our on-premise Gateway, and we've made considerable progress on thatfront. We made improvements throughout the year, and completed the first phase of integrating ZixProtect and ZixArchive into a single pane ofglass console and reporting interface. In January, we deployed it across more than 1,600 cloud customers. In April, we'll have our next major releasethat integrates our bundle into a multi-tier MSP interface with 15-minute deployment, and will provide monthly billing options.     Early in the second half of 2018, we will complete the integration of our cloud bundle with a refreshed user interface and integrated policymanagement. The main takeaway here is that we're making meaningful investments to position us even more strongly from a product perspective.     Our strategy is to continue building of our best-of-breed e-mail encryption solution to provide a suite of e-mail protection solutions that are targetedto serve customers and compliance industries in the mid-market segment.     Our solutions help assure compliance and security in an easy-to-use and cost-effective manner. When you put all of this together in a cloud-basedbundle, with exceptional availability and superior customer service and support, we believe that we're on a path to success.     In closing, although we anticipate competitive pressures driven by the impact of cloud migrations on our on-premise customers to continue in2018, we believe that Zix has never been in a stronger position than it is today. We're driving our business forward at an aggressive pace. We arecombating excess churn with focused programs and tools, and we've made the investment in our core encryption offer to intercept the marketmomentum of e-mail for the cloud. In 2018, we look forward to building off the success that we're seeing with the 87% year-over-year growth inour cloud encryption business and the accelerating momentum we're seeing for ZixProtect and ZixArchive.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

6,64389962,ZIX CORP,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ZIXI",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,Michael Fawzy Malouf,Craig,"Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division",True,False,"A couple of things. I'm just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the churn, specifically as it relates to the Office 360 (sic) [Office365] and just give us a sense where? I know you had a number of initiatives that were attacking that, and I'm just wondering if you could just drilldown a little bit more on that? And then, second of all, with 8% growth in this quarter, 4% to 6% next, and sort of 3% to 5% for the year, sort ofsuggests continuing decreasing growth, and I'm just kind of wondering, as you look through the churn risk that you see this year, when do youthink that you'll get through that and potentially get some reacceleration in the numbers?"
7,64389962,ZIX CORP,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ZIXI",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,David J. Wagner,Zix Corporation,"CEO, President and Director",True,False,"Great. Those are great questions. Mike, so first of all, I'll talk about the churn. So we had the health care M&A that we talked about, and the churnin the Office 365 is -- we're seeing it primarily, and as we said, the on-prem appliance offer. And those customers are ones -- some of them areon-premise for good reasons and don't plan to change, some of them haven't been paying as much attention to their e-mail environment asperhaps they should be, and so when this -- the new leader comes in or they look at the cloud, they're taking everything at once, and movingtypically to the Office 365 solution in those instances. So typically, when a customer does that, they'll -- the e-mail manager that we typically dealwith will say, ""that decision was made by my boss. I didn't have any -- even awareness that it was happening."" And that's what we're working toget ahead of, so that -- those customers know that we have an offer. They know that when they move to the cloud with us, it makes the Office 365migration easier when it happens, and so everything we're doing is focused on getting ahead of that trend. Maybe you could see just how quicklywe're able to do that with increase to 89% cloud deployment this year. So we're making -- with 200 migrations, we're making that transition quiterapidly. When you look at the growth rate more specifically, the larger health care accounts that we talked about, even though we're aware of thecancellation, they're moving out at different times, which is what's contributing to that kind of change in the growth rate throughout the year. Andlast, but not least, I think, you asked about, when will this turn? And so what we're really excited about is how quickly we are moving the businessand intercepting this customer migration to the cloud. And we gave you a lots of numbers to evidence how well we're doing that. With 89% of ournew encryption orders being cloud-based, you can see from a new orders perspective, we are largely through that curve.     So -- if the cloud migration continues at the pace at which it's going, then we should see this turn sometime in 2019."

And when you take a look at the overall growth of the market -- I know there are some industry analysts out there that have theiropinions, how are you looking at it as far as growth of the whole e-mail and Protect and Archive -- wherever you participate. How fast is thatgrowing?"

Wagner,Zix Corporation,"CEO, President and Director",True,False,"Well, so the -- it's really a transition from on-prem to cloud, and so that, Gartner would have the secured e-mail gateway growth in the low singledigits. Our perception is the encryption part of that is growing in the mid-single digits. And the opportunity that we're taking advantage of is that,that rotation and being positioned to capture more and more of that cloud migration, which is why that 87% growth, we are seeing our cloud     9     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

And that's because we're coming off a small number, one; and two, we're moving customers. We have theopportunity to move customers from on-prem to the cloud. That's accelerating that. But that's really the piece that we're excited about, that we'releaning into, and we think there is a lot of room left still in this migration to capture share for these compliance-oriented customers, in particularlyin the mid-market segment."
10,64389962,ZIX CORP,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ZIXI",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,Operator,NA,NA,True,False,Our next question comes from Michael Kim with Imperial Capital.
11,64389962,ZIX CORP,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ZIXI",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,Wonchoon Kim,"Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division",SVP,True,False,"With the growth in ZixProtect and ZixArchive, hoping you'll shed a little more light on where you're seeing the earliest traction, especially on thecustomer verticals? And how is that impacting overall deal sizes with the bundle sale?"
12,64389962,ZIX CORP,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ZIXI",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,David J. Wagner,Zix Corporation,"CEO, President and Director",True,False,"So that's a great question, Michael. So ZixProtect and ZixArchive, we're seeing it where you'd expect it, in health care, with half of our installed base-- there you saw the great numbers, 35% of our orders into the base was ZixProtect and ZixArchive. Actually, our largest transaction in the quarterwas a complete sale full bundle offer, which was brought up the ASP in that account nicely. So that's where the real opportunity is. We're exceedingour plan in new customers. So that attach rate is going a little bit better-than-expected than we expected, but it's the new customer opportunitythat we're really excited about. You know, the trend in the market that we talked about is to a bundle offer, and we're competing very effectivelyin certain segments of the total e-mail protection offer. So that's been really good for us."

I think you cited a competitive displacement in a couple of your larger deals -- bundled deals. Without going into maybe too much detail,but can you talk about what led to those competitive displacements? Was it pricing? Efficacy? Did you put your system behind the competitor'sand catch just more malware? Any context on those displacements?"

Wagner,Zix Corporation,"CEO, President and Director",True,False,"Yes, it's in customers that -- it varied by competitor, obviously. So the customers who really know the Zix brand value service would be a commonthread throughout all of them. Yes, prices really have not been the driver. It's been -- it's service and customers feeling like, Zix has done a greatjob for them for a long time, and trusting our brand and our capability with the full suite."

And then just to expand on the MSP strategy. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you need to do there to invest or enable the MSPsto drive that business? Sort of your expectations as we go through the second half of the year and the need to either establish or build upon yourexisting MSP relationships?

The MSP part is -- one of the areas that we're most excited about is the first place where the full bundle offer is goingto be excel -- accessible easily in a single pane of glass with the very rapid deployment with automated key generation, et cetera. So that will rollout on April 2. We've been talking to partners that have literally hundreds of thousands of mailboxes under management that see, particularly,     10     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

And then, similar to what we've been seeing directly, we're having new MSPpartners that weren't previously considering Zix because we only had best-of-breed, they're now looking at Zix as a very attractive option for thefull suite. So I think we're going to see pickup with our existing MSPs, but probably, actually more quickly with new MSPs that we've not yet donebusiness with. So it'll be both sides, that one, Michael."

They'll be putting both[terminologies], ZixGateway or ZixEncrypt into their data center, leveraging our ZixPort in the U.K. to have a solution that will integrate over therewith the DLP standard that they already are using to address GDPR."

20,64389962,ZIX CORP,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ZIXI",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,Zack Turcotte,NA,NA,True,False,"Zack Turcotte on for Catharine here. Just a couple of things real quick. So first, you kind of touched on it, but are you still mainly targeting theless-than-a-thousand mailbox segment or smaller than that? And do you think that with the success you've been having with resellers and strategygoing forward to focus on the channel even more? Is that going to bring you upmarket a little bit and see some bigger competitors and dealsthere?"
21,64389962,ZIX CORP,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ZIXI",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,David J. Wagner,Zix Corporation,"CEO, President and Director",True,False,"Great question. The transition to over-a-thousand mailboxes really started in October. Prior to October, we were not encouraging enterprise salesteam to sell ZixProtect and ZixArchive. With the success we had in our first 4 months, we then opened up back to the enterprise sales team andwe had good success in landing several customers with, I guess, typically less than 20,000 mailboxes -- none were higher than 20,000 mailboxes,but in that greater-than-one mailbox -- 1,000 mailbox space. And where we worked really well is when, again, where customers value ease-of-useand customer support. We're seeing that extending, depending on the kind of customer, up into the tens of thousands of mailboxes. On the resellerside, I see that as being about 3 quarters behind our direct sales team. We focused, obviously, on -- maybe not obviously, but we focused on trainingup our sale -- our direct sales reps first. We've been leaning into training VARs more aggressively since the Fall, and we saw a little bit of contributionin Q4. We would expect that to be increasing. So that's -- those are the areas, the MSPs and the VARs, that we're seeing good opportunity. I'm notsure if that'll take us up so much into bigger deal sizes, but getting deeper penetration into that mid-market segment that we're really focused on."

And the only other thing, I know it's still pretty early in the bundling strategy, but do you continue to still have a strong -- you still have astrong balance sheet, so do you continue to look for M&A opportunities to expand even further in the product line and push even harder into thebundling strategy right from the beginning?     11     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.
