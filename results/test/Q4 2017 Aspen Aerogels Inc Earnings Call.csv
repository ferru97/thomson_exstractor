2,64389981,ASPEN AEROGELS INC,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ASPN",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,Donald R. Young,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","CEO, President and Director",False,True,"Thank you, John. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our Q4 and fiscal year 2017 earnings call. I will start by providing comments aboutthe business and our performance. Next, John will review our Q4 and fiscal year 2017 financial performance and provide 2018 guidance. We willconclude the call with a Q&A session.     I plan to cover 5 topics in my prepared remarks. First, I will comment on our patent enforcement wins at the United States Patent and TrademarkOffice, the USPTO, the United States International Trade Commission, the ITC, and in the German court.     Second, I will comment on the $5 million prepayment that we will receive from BASF during 2018 and the significant progress we have made inour strategic relationship with them.     Third, I will review our actual performance against our 2017 key performance indicators and introduce 3 key performance indicators for 2018.     Fourth, I will discuss the current commercial environment, including our market outlook for 2018.     And fifth, I will provide an updated view of our strategy, which is centered, in part, on our strong capability to help our customers and partnersshape their own strategies around the global mega trends of resource efficiency and sustainability, help them combine economic success withenvironmental protection and social responsibility. I will also describe the strategic opportunities available to us as we leverage our aerogeltechnology platform across our core, adjacent and new markets.     My first topic today is IP enforcement. In April 2016, we initiated a series of legal actions to assert our rights against companies that infringe ourintellectual property. Since that time, we have logged several victories. During the first half of 2017, one defendant challenged the validity of ourpatents at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This challenge was denied by a panel of 3 patent judges at the USPTO, a very favorableoutcome for Aspen.     Then, in September 2017, the ITC judge issued an initial determination, finding our patent claims valid and infringed upon by the Chinese companies.The judge recommended a limited exclusion order as the remedy to prevent the importation of infringing aerogel products into United States.     In early February, the full ITC Commission issued a final determination confirming the judge's conclusions and issued a limited exclusion orderprohibiting the entry of infringing products into the United States.     Also, in January 2018, a German court issued a series of judgments and injunctions against a Dutch distributor, prohibiting the resale of aerogelproducts originating from China. In the settlement, the distributor agreed not to resell infringing aerogel blankets in all European countries wherewe have patents.     We believe these wins at the USPTO, the ITC and in the German court, clearly validate the strength of our patent portfolio and demonstrate theunique value of our aerogel technology platform -- brings to our business partners around the world.     My second topic today is the $5 million prepayment we will receive from BASF in 2018. BASF is clearly among our most important global businesspartners. In June 2016, we signed agreements with BASF that included commercial, technical and financial elements. The financial support wasinitially linked to our capacity expansion plan in Statesboro, Georgia.     Last week, we amended the agreements to receive $5 million in prepayments in 2018, which will be focused principally on 2 initiatives. The firstinitiative is our joint development work with BASF, focused on building insulation. We have made rapid technical progress on an importantnext-generation product, which has world-class thermal properties and is noncombustible and easy to use. We, both BASF and Aspen, are excited     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

The $5 million prepayment will help toaccelerate these efforts.     The second initiative is our new EP20 capacity expansion project. The goal of EP20 is to increase the manufacturing capacity of our East Providencefacility by 20% by the end of 2020. Additional capacity in our existing facility is very valuable. With growth in revenue from our 2017 level ofapproximately $110 million to our current revenue capacity of approximately $150 million, we estimate that our adjusted EBITDA, excluding IPenforcement costs, will increase from breakeven in 2017 to a projected range of between $16 million and $20 million. In other words, 40% to 50%of the revenue we generate from current levels, drops to the adjusted EBITDA line.     The goal of our EP20 project is to expand our current revenue capacity from approximately $150 million to approximately $180 million per year.At $180 million, we project that the East Providence facility would have the potential to generate adjusted EBITDA in the range of $28 million to$35 million per year. The $5 million prepayment from BASF will help to accelerate the EP20 project, which in turn will significantly enhance theprofit potential and economic profile of our existing business.     Our third topic today is to review our actual performance against our 2017 key performance indicators and to introduce 3 indicators for 2018. Ourfirst 2017 performance indicator was to grow revenue each quarter by gaining market share in our core end markets, principally refinery andpetrochemical companies, demonstrating value and growth in our adjacent markets, including LNG, district energy and power and taking apartnered approach in the development of new market, including building materials. We met the goal in 2017 by growing revenue from $23 millionin Q1 to $25 million in Q2, to $27 million in Q3 and to $36 million in Q4. We believe this momentum is an important first step towards achievingour goal to deliver long-term growth in revenue and profitability.     The second indicator was centered on our revenue not comprised of subsea in the South Asia petrochemical project. To provide context, it isimportant to remember that subsea and the South Asia petrochemical project together accounted for approximately 30% of our revenue in both2015 and 2016. However, in 2017, we had anticipated this revenue would account for less than 10% of our total revenue.     Tracking revenue, other than subsea and the South Asian petrochemical project, enables us to gauge our day-in and day-out maintenance in smallproject work, revenue which, we believe, is the base for sustained future growth.     Entering 2017, we knew we needed to grow base revenue to at least $90 million in order to meet our revenue guidance for the year. For perspective,our base revenue has grown in millions of dollars from the low 70s in 2013 and 2014 to the low 80s in 2015 and 2016.     While we reached our target for overall revenue in 2017 and achieved record base revenue of $88 million, we fell short of our 2017 target of $90million. This shortfall is one of the 3 main reasons why we are cautious with our 2018 revenue guidance. We will continue to track base revenue asa performance indicator during 2018, and will increase the target to $100 million.     The third 2017 performance indicator was related to the strategic importance of diversifying into adjacent markets. We launched on schedule inJuly 2017 our new product, Pyrogel HPS, targeting the power industry, an industry that consumes $1.4 billion of insulation per year.     We define success to be our ability to generate $1 million to $3 million of revenue, to build a portfolio of case studies and to begin the typicaladoption progression for maintenance work to small scope project work and then on to larger-scale project work. We succeeded in meeting theseperformance indicators.     In addition, we worked our way into the global specifications of several key players in this market, including the major turbine manufacturers,which is a critical step as we work the adoption progression. And the successful rollout of Pyrogel HPS is an important demonstration of our corecompetency to commercialize innovation, that is, our ability to leverage our aerogel technology platform and to develop and commercializeinnovative aerogel products in adjacent and new markets.     Looking forward to 2018, the 3 performance indicators we will track involve base revenue, year-to-date growth in both revenue and adjustedEBITDA and the EP20 project.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 211                The first performance indicator, base revenue -- again, revenue not comprised of subsea or the large South Asia petrochemical project, is a goodindicator of day-in and day-out maintenance and small scope project work, our version of a recurring revenue stream. We are targeting $100 millionin base revenue for 2018, representing year-over-year growth in base revenue in the range of 10% to 15%.     The second performance indicator for 2018 relates to growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The performance indicator is growth in year-to-daterevenue and adjusted EBITDA as measured at the end of each quarter. After delivering a 30% revenue CAGR from 2008 through 2015, our goal isto return to double-digit revenue growth, and we firmly believe that significant growth in adjusted EBITDA will follow.     We envision a strong energy infrastructure business that generates cash to reinvest in realizing the substantial potential in our core and adjacentmarkets and to fund select business opportunities in new markets, which can lead to breakout value.     The third 2018 performance metric relates to the EP20 initiative. Again, our goal is to increase the capacity in our East Providence manufacturingfacility by 20% by the end of 2020. The capacity expansion to our existing manufacturing assets will be driven primarily by process technologyadvancements, designed to improve manufacturing productivity and capital efficiency.     We believe the EP20 plan is achievable because we have tested the concept in advance in our full-scale pilot plan, which we commissioned in 2016.We will also conduct several studies during 2018 that will lay the foundation for EP20 work planned for the second and third years.     Our 2018 capital budget for EP20 is $3 million, which will be supported by the prepayment from BASF. We will report out on the 3 2018 performanceindicators each quarter. Again, the 3 indicators are expanding our base revenue, driving year-to-date growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDAand increasing capacity through our EP20 initiative.     Our fourth topic today is a discussion of the current commercial environment. While we have continued to diversify our revenue successfully withgrowth in our adjacent markets, we remain linked to oil prices and related energy infrastructure activity levels. WTI crude prices were roughly $55per barrel a year ago and moved $10 per barrel in each direction, up and down, during the year and are now at approximately $60 per barrel. Thisdeal's reasonably stable relative to the $108 to $28 per barrel slide that we experienced during the 2014, 2015 and 2016 time frame.     While the market feels better today than it did one year ago, we remain cautious for 2018 for 3 reasons. First, as I stated earlier, we've slightlyunderachieved on our 2017 base revenue performance metric at $88 million versus our goal of reaching or surpassing $90 million. While we reachedthe upper end of our 2017 revenue guidance, and we have set an aggressive goal of $100 million for base revenue in 2018, we were disappointedthat we did not achieve the 10% to 15% base revenue growth during 2017 that we wanted. This is one of the reasons why we have chosen to becautious in our revenue outlook in 2018.     The second reason we are cautious on our 2018 revenue guidance, again relates to base revenue. While we underachieved our base revenue in2017, we overachieved against our expectations in the subsea market and on the continued supply to the South Asia petrochemical project,reaching 19% of total revenue in 2017. We expect that percentage to be in the 7% to 10% range for 2018, a $9 million to $14 million drop in nonbaserevenue. We expect to make up most or all of that revenue loss in 2018 with significant base revenue growth, but nevertheless it is a big hole tofill.     The third reason we remain cautious for 2018 revenue guidance is because insulation is a late cycle product. The fundamentals and activity levelsof the market are stronger and momentum appears to be building. As you may remember, we were beneficiaries of late cycle activity in Q4 2015,a period of time when WTI crude was heading to prices under $30 per barrel. Even though oil prices were crashing and the market was weak, theflywheel was still turning for us and we posted a record quarter with $37.4 million of revenue and $5.4 million of adjusted EBITDA. If current marketconditions continue to build strength through 2018, we would expect to feel the full positive impact in 2019 and into 2020.     We are encouraged by the -- by market activity levels. We believe, if we can get out in front of business in a timely way, that we will continue towin a growing market share. We are increasing the size of our sales force by 25% in order to take increasing market share in a strengtheningcommercial environment, an action we believe will enable us to outpace the market and result in strong growth.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Our ability to build base revenue, to position ourselves for significant project work and to continue to exhibit strength in entering newmarkets, gives us confidence that over a 2- to 3-year period we can experience substantial and diverse growth, even within the current energyprice environment.     This narrative leads to our fifth and final topic, which is the articulation of our strategy. Our strategy is to leverage our aerogel technology platform.There are 3 key elements. The first element is to grow our core and adjacent markets to fully utilize the East Providence manufacturing facility,including the expanded capacity from the EP20 initiative. At capacity, we would have the potential to be a business generating $180 million ofrevenue and adjusted EBITDA of between $28 million and $35 million.     The second element is to organize around innovation and to leverage our core competency of commercializing innovation. We have world-classaerogel product and process technology and the premier aerogel research science is committed to continuing to advance the science. We havecreated a new business development team dedicated to prioritizing the best opportunities for our aerogel technology platform in order to addresssignificant global challenges and to identify world-class partners and optimal business structures to accelerate value creation.     The third element of the strategy is to maximize long-term shareholder value. With revenue growth in our core and adjacent markets, combinedwith the improved profit potential in our East Providence plant associated with our EP20 project, we believe we can generate free cash to investin 1 or 2 new business opportunities where our aerogel technology platform has the potential to create breakout value. Our vision for Aspen is tobe a prosperous and valuable leader in our core and adjacent markets and to have the potential for breakout value in new markets.     Overall, we are confident that the strength of our technology and the ROI that we bring to our end users across multiple markets will enable solidperformance for our company. Our progress from core to adjacent and to new markets is powerful and creates the opportunity to build a largeand profitable company. We have an experienced team of people, and we are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and to realize ourvision for the company.     Now, I'll turn the call over to John for a review of the financial results."
3,64389981,ASPEN AEROGELS INC,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ASPN",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,John F. Fairbanks,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","CFO, VP and Treasurer",False,True,"Thanks, Don, and good afternoon. I'd like to start by running through our reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 at asummary level.     Fourth quarter total revenue grew 32% to $36.4 million versus $27.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter net loss was $1.7 millionor $0.07 per share compared to $5.7 million or $0.25 per share last year.     Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was positive $2.2 million compared to negative $2.1 million a year ago. We define adjusted EBITDA as net incomeor loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other items that we do not believe are indicativeof our core operating performance.     Patent enforcement costs had a less significant impact on our net loss and adjusted EBITDA during the fourth quarter this year than in the fourthquarter of last year. We incurred $600,000 of patent enforcement costs during the fourth quarter versus $1.9 million in the fourth quarter last year.     For the full year, total revenue declined 5% to $111.6 million. Net loss was $19.3 million or $0.83 per share in 2017 versus a net loss of $12 millionor $0.52 per share last year. And adjusted EBITDA for the year was negative $3.3 million compared to positive $3.9 million a year ago.     Patent enforcement costs had a significant impact on both our net loss and adjusted EBITDA during both 2017 and 2016. We incurred $3.5 millionof patent enforcement costs during 2017 versus $3.6 million in 2016.     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 213                Our performance during the fourth quarter again met our objectives, to build sequential quarterly momentum during the year. Total revenue thisyear improved from a low of $23 million in the first quarter to a high of $36.4 million in the fourth quarter.     As we discussed during our previous conference calls, our gross profit and gross margin are highly dependent on product revenue and capacityutilization level. Principally as a result of the growth in quarterly revenue during the year, gross margin improved from a low of 10% in the firstquarter to a high of 21% in the fourth quarter.     Gross profit dollars also improved from $2.2 million in the first quarter to $7.8 million in the fourth quarter. The adjusted EBITDA improved fromnegative $5.1 million in the first quarter to a positive $2.2 million in the fourth quarter.     With future revenue and utilization growth, we would expect to see percentage growth in gross profit and adjusted EBITDA continue to outpacethe associated growth in product revenue.     I'll now provide additional detail on the components of our results. First, I'll discuss revenue. Fourth quarter total revenue was comprised of productrevenue of $35.9 million and research services revenue of $472,000. Total revenue for the year was comprised of product revenue of $109.6 millionand research services revenue of $2 million.     During the fourth quarter, product revenue increased by $8.7 million, or 32%, to $35.9 million versus $27.2 million last year. Fourth quarter productrevenue growth was driven by strong demand in the U.S. and European markets and a high volume of subsea project work.     During the quarter, total shipments increased by 12% to 11.9 million square feet of aerogel blankets. And our average selling price increased by18% to $3.02 per square foot, principally due to the increase in the mix of higher price subsea products this year.     For the full year, product revenue decreased by $5.9 million or 5% versus last year. This decrease was driven in large part by the conclusion ofshipments to the multiyear South Asia petrochemical project.     For 2017, total shipments decreased by 15% to 37.5 million square feet, while our average selling price increased by 12% versus 2016 to $2.92 persquare foot. Price increase during the year reflected both the increase in mix of our higher-price subsea products and a decrease in revenue fromour lower-price South Asia petrochemical project.     Looking forward, we anticipate broad-based growth across our core and adjacent markets will offset most or all of the expected revenue declineassociated with the completion of the South Asia petrochemical project and a decline in the subsea market.     Revenue generated in the subsea market and from the multiyear South Asia petrochemical project contributed $21 million to total revenue in2017. Our 2018 revenue forecast anticipates a decline in revenue in these markets to approximately $7 million to $12 million, although projectwork can be difficult to predict.     Our 2018 revenue forecast anticipates revenue growth in our base business of approximately $9 million to $14 million, or 10% to 15%, to a rangeof between $97 million and $102 million. As a result, we expect product revenue -- total product revenue during 2018 of between $104 millionand $114 million compared to the $109 million we generated during 2017. This expectation is reflected in our 2018 annual guidance.     We expect our average selling price for 2018 will remain flat from 2017 at $2.92 per square foot, plus or minus $0.05, with the impact of a 2%effective price increase in 2018 offset by the anticipated reduction in the mix of our higher-price subsea revenue. This average selling priceexpectation is also reflected in our 2018 guidance.     I'll now turn to our research services revenue. Our research services revenue is related to contract research performed principally for governmentagencies. Research services revenue was $473,000 during the fourth quarter and $2 million during the year. For 2018, we expect research servicesrevenue of approximately $1.75 million, down slightly from 2017. This expectation is reflected as well in our 2018 guidance.     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 214                Next, I'll discuss gross profit. Gross profit was $7.8 million or 21% of revenue during the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $3.7 million or 13% last year.This improvement in gross profit and gross margin was driven by the 18% increase in average selling prices for our products; the 12% growth inshipment volume, offset in part by a 7% decrease in production volume that we instituted to manage inventory balances; and a volume-relatedincrease in material costs during the quarter.     As a reminder, our variable contribution margin is approximately 45%. As a result, an increase in revenue and capacity utilization will lead to adisproportionate increase in both gross profit and gross margin.     This case held true in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 32% growth in revenue versus 2016 led to an expansion of our gross margin by nearly 800 basispoints and a 109% increase in gross profit dollars.     For the year, gross profit was $18.7 million or 17% of revenue versus $23.3 million or 20% of revenue last year. Declining gross profit and grossmargin this year was largely the result of the 15% decline in shipment volume, the cumulative 25% reduction in production volume enacted tomanage inventory balances, and a small increase in material and warranty costs, offset in part, by the 12% increase in our average selling price forour products and a decrease in manufacturing expenses during the period.     Looking forward to 2018, we expect gross margins to remain in the high teens for the full year, but like 2017, quarterly gross margins could runfrom the low double digits to the low 20s depending on quarterly revenue volume.     This gross margin expectation includes our planned investment in manufacturing personnel to reestablish full-time 3 line operations in the EastProvidence plant, to improve manufacturing productivity and costs, and in support of our EP20 initiative to expand the capacity of the EastProvidence facility by 20% by the end of 2020. This gross margin expectation is included in our 2018 guidance.     Next, I'll discuss operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses were flat to last year at $9.4 million. For the year, operating expenses grewby $3.3 million or 9% versus last year to $37.8 million.     Looking forward, our 2018 guidance includes our expectation that operating expenses will increase by 4% to slightly more than $39 million for2018. This projected operating expense increase reflects our planned investment in sales, research and support personnel, and expense to drivegrowth in our energy infrastructure business, and to develop breakout opportunities in new markets, offset in part by a projected decline in patentenforcement costs of approximately $2.5 million.     Next, I'll discuss our balance sheet and cash flow for 2017. Cash used in operations of $4.6 million reflected our negative adjusted EBITDA of $3.3million and $1.3 million of cash used for working capital during the year. This use of cash for working capital was higher than we had recentlyprojected. In particular, our accounts receivable balance at year-end was temporarily higher than expected due to strong project-related revenueduring the fourth quarter.     Capital expenditures for the year totaled $6.1 million in line with our guidance of $6.3 million and down from $13 million in 2016.     We ended 2017 with $10.7 million of cash, $3.8 million on our revolving credit facility, net current assets of $26.1 million, and shareholders' equityof $101 million. And importantly, we had access to an additional $13.9 million under our revolving credit facility at year-end.     I'll now summarize our full year financial outlook for 2018. Total revenue is expected to range between $106 million and $116 million. Net loss isexpected to range between $16.9 million and $19.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between a loss of $2 million and a loss of $5million. EPS is expected to range between a loss of $0.71, a loss of $0.85 per share. This EPS guidance assumes a weighted average of 23.6 millionshares outstanding for the year.     The 2018 outlook also assumes depreciation and amortization of $10.3 million, stock-based compensation of $4.3 million, and interest expense of$300,000.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

And for the full year, we expect a gross margin in the high teens and an average selling price of $2.92 per square foot, plus or minus$0.05.     During 2018, we'll continue our focus on controlling capital expenditures to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. Our 2018capital budget of $4 million is comprised of $1 million of maintenance-related capital projects and $3 million for our EP20 initiative to expand thecapacity of the East Providence facility by 20% by the end of 2020.     Turning to cash at an aggregate level. Within the context of the adjusted EBITDA range in our 2018 full year outlook, we expect to exit 2018 withbetween $8 million and $11 million of net cash on hand.     As Don mentioned, we have amended our supply agreement with BASF to secure $5 million in advance payments in 2018 to help support ourcapacity expansion plans, our process improvement initiatives, and our new-business development efforts. This $5 million in advance paymentsis included in our 2018 year-end cash guidance.     While we don't provide specific quarterly guidance on a routine basis, we think it's important from time to time to provide our investors with ageneral view to our expectations during the year.     In general, we expect our quarterly financial performance in 2018 to mirror the profile of our 2017 quarterly performance with a significant step-downin revenue and profitability in the first quarter and sequential quarterly growth thereafter.     We're also striving to deliver year-over-year improvement in financial performance during each of the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month year-to-date periodsduring 2018 and to enter 2019 with strong operating and financial momentum.     I'll now turn the call back to Chantel for Q&A."

Just a thought process, is it some of the large project activity that you expect tohit starting in 2019, views of some partnerships on the horizon? Or how should we think about that?"

Young,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","CEO, President and Director",True,False,"I think there are maybe 2 ways of doing it. When we're doing an expansion in a plant -- in this particular one, where we're really improving theprocess technology of our existing assets as opposed to adding new assets to the facility, kind of the brute force method, it's very difficult to dothat kind of work while you're operating the plant full out. And so this is the time to do that work. So we've got the perfect time to do it, one. Andof course, we wouldn't do it if we weren't confident that we could grow our revenues to that $150 million level and to the $180 million level. Youjust wouldn't do this. And so that's in the backdrop as well. So our goal here is to continue to grow that base revenue, and we said a few times inour presentation this evening, in that 10% to 15% range year in and year out, and then put some projects on top of it. As you know Eric, we'veworked that progression from doing maintenance work to small-scope work to large-scope project work, pretty successfully. And LNG is the best     9     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

So we're doing this with purpose, and we also believe that it's justthe right time to do it, and there's no question that having BASF help shoulder the load a bit here financially is really important to us."

And that's a good segue to my second question. Just -- I mean, it seems like the health of that relationship with BASF is in very good shapeis this -- is this a case where -- I mean, should we think about that Plant 2 -- I mean, it would seem that this pushes that off quite a bit, or that BASFdoesn't necessarily care whether their $20 million eventually goes to Plant 2 or it's invested in your plant. They just want to have that capacity?"

Young,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","CEO, President and Director",True,False,"Yes, they would like access to the -- guaranteed access to the capacity. If you go back to the 2015, early '16 time frame, there were points in timewhere we were capacity constrained significantly -- '14, '15 and the early '16, and they were concerned about having that happen to them again.And so that's part of their motivation here in helping us with our capacity expansion. And it obviously, provides a nice sort of baseload activity forus as well as we go out and create this new capacity. So those are the drivers. The relationship is very strong. We've talked a bit here about thefinancial parts of it, but they've helped us with some of the operating improvements that we're making in our facility in East Providence, and ofcourse, working closely with us through the JDA on these next-generation products as well. So it's a strong relationship but we really appreciatetheir help."

Maybe last one from me. Just on subsea yesterday, Technip had their call, and they had pretty positive commentary on activity continuingin 2018 and going forward. Is your view of 2018 more a case of -- I know you don't report a backlog, but that the backlog for subsea as it standstoday isn't necessarily there, and it's more about if you were to get awards, you're late cycle, and so that would be more late '18 and -- or 2019 work.Is that the reason? Because I mean, what Technip said and what you're looking for, those are different views."

Young,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","CEO, President and Director",True,False,"So Technip has been our largest customer in the subsea dating back to 2004 and '05, so they've been a great partner of ours through that period.And I was encouraged to hear their report. I listened in and read their work. Subsea is really difficult for us to project. We are bird-dogging morethan a dozen projects today around the world in the subsea. And those could break anytime. So the hard part is predicting it. And we just -- if youjust look at the last 3 years, and John correct me if I'm wrong, if I remember correctly, the subsea numbers were $24 million, $4 million and $14million. So they're just banging all around the place. So it's really difficult to kind of want to hang your hat on any particular number. And so whatwe do is we take a longer-term view of it and just try to find kind of an average number. And if you go out 5 years, the average number is kind ofin that 7, 8, 9 kind of range, and we're sort of just projecting that forward here in 2018. Look, we hope Technip is spot on. I mean, they are reallyright in the middle of that market, obviously, so they know a lot. Yes, we do come a little late cycle, so maybe it would have the biggest impact onus late '18 and into 2019. We feel good about 2019 for a lot of different reasons and that's one of them."

We'll obviously focus on projects that weget the best bang for the buck initially with that money. So that original -- that initial $3 million will go a long way towards gaining some fairlysignificant capacity during the year. And we'll apprise you of our progress during the year as we go, rather than setting expectations, but we'll letyou know what advances we're making and what we're seeing in terms of capacity improvement. And the $15 million to $20 million is that long-termmessage, principally capital spending. So it would be -- it's in the initial $3 million out of essentially a minimum of $15 million. So we'd expect toincrease our spending in 2019 and 2020 to ultimately complete that project."

That's helpful. And it seems like a nice flexible approach. And maybe if we can touch just a little bit more about some of the markets.It sounds like you've seen pretty broad-based growth across all the different areas, but maybe if you could just give us a little more color on someof those individual markets?"

Young,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","CEO, President and Director",True,False,"Well, let me just -- I can just make a couple of comments. We had nice growth in 2017, in both the United States and in -- and across Europe. Goodgrowth numbers, very significant numbers, in fact, in the U.S. and continuing good momentum in that market. And I talked about increasing thesize of our sales force. I'm really -- after a good amount of travel in the second half of 2017, I'm convinced that if we can get in front of business ina timely way, our products are now well accepted. They're well proven. They're no longer exotic or novel products, and if we can get in front ofbusiness -- and when I say in a timely way, I mean, getting the specifications early on of some of these mid- and large-size projects. I think we'll winmore than our fair share of that work. So I'm feeling good about -- through the maturation level of our product or of that adoption cycle, and sothat's been good. I feel good about that. I've talked in the past a bit about the LNG market. Again, we were very successful delivering the 3 projects,and the engineering companies and the asset owners gave us very high marks for doing what we said we would do and for that product to bevaluable to them. And as you look forward, some of those very same engineering companies and end-users, asset owners, have next-stage projectsright on the drawing board. And so we're in a terrific position to compete, not so much for the size that we did in 2017, you'll remember, thosewere $3 million, $5 million and $8 million in size, but for projects that could be measured, you know, in the $10 million, $20 million, even $30 millionkinds of range, so we've done a terrific job doing that. And also, I just want to focus on the adjacent markets in addition to LNG. Our district energybusiness and the launch of our HPS project -- product have continued to be successful. So getting incremental growth from those segments isreally critical to us as we grow base revenue and position ourselves for some good project work."

When I step back and I think about, we've got a core business where, initially last year, you were looking to do $90 million to $100 million.That got pared back. Then we were looking to do $90 million, and then we were beneath that. We're looking, as an aspiration, to hit $100 million,     11     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

The other aspects of your business and looking about -- or looking at the project orientation,was a lot of variability there. And so it almost seems like we're really kind of building some flex capacity to accommodate a few LNG projects thatare going to be fairly finite. I may be misinterpreting things, but can you help me to better understand this, because once we expand, if we're therein 2020, I would want to think that we have a good base to our core business that is justifying that, versus the project side. Any help around thatwould be great."
18,64389981,ASPEN AEROGELS INC,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ASPN",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,Donald R. Young,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","CEO, President and Director",True,False,"So our target for base revenue this year is $100 million, and we're going to put all our resources into achieving that number. And I would anticipatethat, that number continues to grow in that 10% to 15% range, year in and year out, as we move forward. And if you start to put a couple of projectson top of that level, over the course of 2018, 2019 and 2020, we are pushing up hard against that 150 number. And second, as I said earlier, theonly time we can really make these investments in the East Providence is not when you're running full out at 100% capacity, but as you lead up tothat, where you have a little bit of flexibility in your management of that facility. And so we are making that -- we have a strong conviction thatwe're going to grow in the way that I just talked about, and that's why we're making those investments now."
19,64389981,ASPEN AEROGELS INC,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, ASPN",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,John F. Fairbanks,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","CFO, VP and Treasurer",True,False,"And one other point, Sean. Some of the advancements that we'll make this year with that $3 million in capital expenditures, will be to improveyields in our plant. And that -- those yield improvements increase our output, but it also drops our costs, and so there'll be a benefit to the bottomline that will accrue later in 2018 into 2019 and '20. So we -- it will help us becomes more profitable. The other piece of it is the EP20 projectsthemselves are principally capital. So it's capital expenditures. Yet this will not require us to increase the operating expense levels in our business,and that's why that incremental profitability associated with the increase -- the potential profitability associated with that increase of $30 millionfrom $150 million to $180 million is so profitable to us. So I think this -- that the investment we're making in 2018 is limited to that $3 million ofCapEx. It's the right time for those projects. When we start to fill the plant, we won't be able to accomplish those projects. We'll get an immediatebenefit from yield improvement, and then we'll get the benefit of improved profitability and cash flow when we do fill the plant. And so from thatperspective, we felt it was the right time to make the investment."

I follow that, and I suppose that perhaps what it then comes back to me is where the confidence is in the growth factor for thatcore business, because again, last year we ended up in a very different place versus where our expectations were going to be. And again, this yearas you guys are targeting that $100 million, unless I heard you incorrectly, it sounded like you were explicitly stating, we want to be cautious andconservative. And there are asterisks that you're putting around that.
