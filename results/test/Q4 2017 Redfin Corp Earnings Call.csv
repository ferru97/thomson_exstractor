2,64389860,REDFIN CORP,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, RDFN.OQ",Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call,Glenn Kelman,Redfin Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",False,True,"Thanks, Elena, and hi, everyone. Redfin's year-over-year market share gains continued to accelerate in the fourth quarter, and our revenues exceededthe range we gave you last November. More importantly, we invested in fundamental improvements to our customer service while reducing ourloss from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017.     Our fourth quarter revenue was $95.8 million, an increase of 43% over the fourth quarter of 2016. A more fair comparison excludes new businessesto consider only the sales through our own agents and our partner agents. These revenues were up 36% over the fourth quarter of 2016. Excludingrevenue from new businesses is especially important because our new experimental service for buying homes outright from consumers, RedfinNow, counts the entire sale price of a home as revenue, even though our gain on the sale is only a tiny fraction of that price. Our first Redfin Nowsales closed in the second quarter of 2017.     We still lost money for the quarter and the year. While this was by design, we have to soberly account in this call for what we're buying with thoselosses: technologies to make our brokerage better, faster and more efficient; new products to broaden our customer appeal; new businesses togive each customer more value. I've never worked so long in a business where there are still so many ways for it to grow.     The most important measure of our performance is our customer satisfaction. In a November 2017 survey of nearly 2,000 Americans who workedwith an agent over the past year to buy or sell a home, Redfin's net promoter score was 52% higher than traditional agents. A net promoter scoreis a measure of customer satisfaction. This was the fifth consecutive survey in which Redfin's customer satisfaction was higher than our competitors.     Our market share by home value was 0.71% in the fourth quarter, the same as in the third quarter, but a gain of 0.15 percentage points over thefourth quarter of 2016. Year-over-year share gains accelerated steadily throughout 2017 from 0.10 percentage points in the first quarter to 0.11 inthe second, 0.14 in the third and now 0.15 in the fourth quarter. We believe that share is the best measure of our competitive position because itexcludes the housing market's ups and downs.     As we predicted in our last 2 earnings calls, traffic growth moderated in the fourth quarter, mostly because our audience has become so large inabsolute terms. But redfin.com continued to be the U.S.'s fastest-growing real estate website. Our year-over-year growth in online visitors was 33%in the fourth quarter compared to 38% in the third quarter. We expect strong traffic growth in 2018 but with percentage gains continuing tomoderate. Beyond 2018, we believe our traffic growth will come from the 77 markets that Redfin opened less than 10 years ago, from Googlesearches on real estate terms where we haven't been competitive before and, as Redfin becomes more well known for listing search, from morepeople bypassing Google to come directly to our site. We also expect that our business will depend less on our growth as a listing search site andmore on our growth as a brokerage, with gains in repeat customers continuing to accelerate and more people coming to Redfin for on-demandhome tours and lower fees.     More advertising is also likely to contribute to our growth. As our conviction deepens that we offer the best service, we want America to knowabout it. In the fourth quarter, we prepared the most comprehensive marketing campaign in Redfin's history, with our first major radio and billboardads both promoting our 1% listing fee. To illustrate the power of on-demand home tours, we also developed a new TV ad that shows a coupleinstantly moving from one listing to another via magic doors activated by our mobile application. Starting February 5, these ads began to run inmore than a dozen U.S. cities.     Beyond traditional media, we plan to continue drawing on our unique data about which online visitors actually buy or sell a home. This will let usmake better investments than we believe any broker can in online video, search engine ads, retargeting and other digital media.     Finding advertising channels that we can profitably spend lots of money on continues to be a strategic priority for Redfin. Most of our potentialcustomers still don't know about us. In November 2017, we asked thousands of people buying or selling a home in long-established Redfin marketsto name their top 3 real estate websites. Less than 1 in 3 named redfin.com. When asked to name top 3 brokerage, less than 1 in 10 named Redfin,even in markets where we've run TV ads for 3 years. One of the only reasons we may defer improving profits every year is to spend more on ads.We spent 20% of 2017 gross profits on advertising placements, but if we find a winning formula, in 1 year, we might spend nearly double thatpercentage to get our name out there. Those ads aren't going to be immediately profitable, given that it typically takes 6 months to buy a home     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

No mass-market advertising is going topay for itself the year it runs. Even if an ad doesn't bring us enough customers to immediately offset its expense, our bet would be that we'd benefitfrom the increased awareness for years to come.     Over time, our ad spending would grow much more slowly than our business, likely returning to between 10% and 20% of gross profits. But if thisincreased awareness accelerated listing share gains, it could create a virtuous cycle with yard signs reinforcing other forms of advertising.     Already, we've seen evidence that we may be able to create this virtuous cycle in Seattle, where we have a hometown advantage but also thehighest listing share. Nearly 1 in 5 Seattle real estate consumers named Redfin as the top 3 brokerage, which is double the rate of our next bestmarket and significantly higher than it was 6 months ago. We'll have data from our 2018 campaign across many markets by August, and we'll letyou know if Seattle's awareness gains hold up and broaden to other markets.     For homebuyers, the simplest benefit we can tell in our ads and on our site is speed by instantly scheduling home tours, and we're getting faster.We updated our scheduling software so that we could automatically find the time for an agent to meet a customer on 83 -- excuse me, 83% of ourDecember home tours, up from 68% in September. Confirming a tour request without any phone calls between coordinators, agents and customerslets us capture more would-be customers with less work. Just as a retailer increases revenues through elaborate systems to get the right productsto the right shelves, we've worked for years to ensure the right Redfin agent is available for each customer at the right time.     The next step for us is rapidly confirming the availability of the listings the customer wants to tour. Typically, the buyer's agent calls the seller'sagent to see if the owner can get the house ready for a showing. But starting in the third quarter, Redfin began using a combination of softwareand call center employees to do this more quickly and efficiently. By the last week of December, we confirmed 9% of home tours without requiringa Redfin buyer's agent to do anything except show up. A major 2018 focus will be confirming listing availability for nearly all tours. Our goal overtime is to convey a competitive advantage, not just to Redfin, but to our homebuying customers, who should never have to wait on an agent tosee a hot listing.     This commitment to speed is why we've also invested in our own offer writing software, which lets our agents put together a bid on a listing in afew minutes. In the fourth quarter, we expanded the markets the software supports from Chicago, D.C. and Virginia to Maryland. The localizationinvolved for each market is extensive. Different states, counties and cities require different offer forms, and local customs around earnest moneyamounts and other deal terms require different default values for the forms field.     In Maryland alone, we have to support 30 addenda. For these reasons, it will take us years to adapt our offer writing software to every major U.S.market. But as we do, we believe we'll be able to move faster than any other broker at lower cost and with comprehensive data about what it takesto win in each neighborhood.     Even as we automate the opening and closing stages of the homebuying process, we're investing in more personal service during the long searchin between to give our homebuying customers more guidance on how to win in an increasingly competitive market. As we discussed in our lastearnings call, we want shareholders to understand this investment, which is a bet that spending more on our service could not only lead to happierhomebuyers and more sales but ultimately to more gross profits per sale. For that bet to pay off, we'll have to buck an increasingly competitivemarket. When home prices rose in the last boom, easy lending standards and lots of new construction let homebuyers keep up, but now that themarket is so much tighter, our job as agents is to work harder at finding a way for each homebuying customer to win.     Over the years, the number of customers that a Redfin agent has met in order to generate 1 sale has varied widely as we've made changes to ourservice, which tells us that what we do can increase or decrease our customers' rate of success. And since most of the customers our agents spendtime with don't end up buying a home with us, we know that any improvements in our customer success rate can save our agents plenty of time.The stakes for customers are even higher as our service can be the difference between winning or losing a house. In an industry where referralsand repeat sales are so important, we believe the only way to be America's most successful brokerage is to have the most successful customers.     Our investments in personal service began in the third quarter of 2017, with modest agent hiring in a season when we usually hire no agentswhatsoever. But then in the fourth quarter, we developed an entire program for asking agents to meet homebuying customers more often and to     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Coming into 2018, Redfin plans to lower the number of homebuying customers eachRedfin agent supports by 10%, hiring more Redfin agents than we would have in 2017. The ratio of customers to agents will still be slightly lowerthan it was in 2016, a year when our buyers' agents were nonetheless more productive than in 2017. If this new level of personal service doesn'tmake our customers more successful in 2018, agent productivity and profit per transaction will decline.     But the dwindling number of homes for sale notwithstanding, we have reason to believe our 2018 homebuyers will in fact be more successful. In2012, when the market first swung sharply in sellers' favor, reducing the number of buyers supported by each Redfin agent increased our customersuccess rates. We saw the same correlation in 2017. The agents who served fewer customers had higher customer success rates. We've also beenencouraged by more recent developments, including a successful trial last fall of coffee shop strategy sessions with our customers for comparingthe terms of winning and losing offers.     To help our agents give customers more personal service, we also upgraded our software with a new online calendar that shows an agent what'sgoing on with each of our customers this week, whether that's a home tour or negotiating deadline or a closing. Other software released in thefourth quarter made it easier for Redfin agents to focus on customers who most need attention based on the customer's online search activity andbrokerage interactions. This lets our agents immediately see the customers who signed up for one tour with Redfin, but not a second, or whichcustomers have engaged a Redfin agent without subscribing to alerts for new listings in their price range. We developed this software using theReact JavaScript library, pioneered by Facebook for high-performance and easy porting from desktop browsers to native mobile applications. Weknow of no other brokerage taking such an aggressive approach to mobile software for ensuring that on-the-go agents deliver the right serviceto each customer. By the second quarter of this year, we'll get our first data on whether these new programs and online tools help more buyerswin an offer and what the effect will be on profit per sale.     We're also working hard to serve home sellers better, primarily through lower prices. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, we lowered our listingfee for a full-service Redfin agent from 1.5% to 1% in 18 markets -- excuse me, 18 additional markets. We offset that savings with a fee increase forour homebuying customers by refunding a smaller portion of our commission as a buyer's agent. The 1% fee is now available in a total of 26 markets,which accounted for 87% of 2017's brokerage transactions, but we do not expect to expand it further anytime soon as home prices are too low inthe remaining 60 markets for it to be viable. At the beginning of 2017, 1% pricing was available in markets that accounted for 54% of our transactions.     Years of testing in Washington, D.C., then in Seattle, Chicago, Denver and San Diego have shown that this pricing increases our overall share, andit's easy to see why. Sellers contractually agree to a fee in advance when hiring a seller's agent, whereas buyers have treated our commission refundlike the tooth fairy. They're skeptical or oblivious until discovering the money as if under their pillow only once they've closed and months aftermeeting their Redfin agent. The 1% fee is also easier to promote in ads and on redfin.com.     We're also exploring other ways customers can benefit from our efficiency by experimenting with a level of service that we believe no brokeragehas been able to consistently deliver before at a fee that is still lower than the commission typically charged by traditional agents. We call this ourRedfin Concierge Service and charge a fee of 2% rather than 1% to coordinate and pay for staging and other cosmetic improvements that webelieve can increase the final sales price. Redfin Concierge is only available for homes expected to sell for $500,000 or more.     We began testing the service in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. to see if it can broaden our customer appeal and also to determine if the 2% feecovers our cost. We expect it will take at least a year to iterate on the offering and how we market and sell it and then to see how customers like it.     The second experimental offering for selling our customers' houses is Redfin Now, in which Redfin buys a consumer's home outright, letting theowner move on with cash in her pocket, while we try to spruce up the home to sell it at a profit. The owner typically nets less money than she wouldby hiring a Redfin agent, but gets this money sooner with more certainty and less hassle.     Redfin Now began buying homes in January 2017 and recorded our first sale in April. We've limited ourselves to affordable parts of SouthernCalifornia and did no more than $10 million in home purchases at any one time either on our books or under contract to be bought by Redfin. Aswe said in our last earnings call, we're no longer divulging exact transaction counts.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

But at the same time, we experimented with payinghomeowners less for their homes in an effort to -- excuse me, in an effort to widen our profits on the subsequent sale. It didn't work. More homeownersrejected our offers, and we bought far fewer homes in the fourth quarter of 2017 than the 19 we reported in the third quarter.     In January and February, we're now paying slightly more for Redfin Now homes and completing purchases at a brisk pace. But since we came intothe first quarter of 2018, with few homes to sell, we expect fewer sales. That said, it now seems likely that purchase activity will continue to accelerate.So by the second or third quarter of this year, we expect to allocate $20 million rather than $10 million for purchasing homes from consumers.Given our success so far at selling all the homes we've bought, we view this as an acceptable risk.     We still haven't hired enough engineers and businesspeople to run Redfin Now at any scale except as an experiment, but we'll continue to run itas such, evaluating each quarter, whether Redfin Now can appeal to more than 10% of would-be home sellers at prices that compensate us for ourrisk.     The other new business we wanted to update you about is Redfin Mortgage, which we launched in the first quarter of 2017, to issue loans to ourhomebuying customers. We believe integrating a lending operation with Redfin's existing brokerage and title businesses, all running off our ownsoftware, can ultimately lead to an entirely digital closing, where Redfin borrowers can compete almost like cash buyers. As with Redfin Now, we'reno longer disclosing exact transaction counts. But we were pleased to see loan volume increase during a season when purchase is slow. Fourthquarter loan volume in Texas grew by nearly 40% over the 13 loans we closed in the third quarter, in large part because Redfin Mortgage advisersworked harder to pre-approve loans faster and connect with our customers and our agents on nights and weekends, when deals usually cometogether. We also expanded to a second state, Illinois, where we closed a few loans. And near the end of the year, we expanded to Washington,D.C.     And with that, I'll turn it over to Chris."
3,64389860,REDFIN CORP,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, RDFN.OQ",Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call,Chris Nielsen,Redfin Corporation,CFO and Principal Financial & Accounting Officer,False,True,"Thanks, Glenn. We finished 2017 with solid fourth quarter results that were above our guidance range. Revenue was $96 million, including a $5million contribution from Redfin Now. Our revenue grew 43% year-over-year. Real estate revenue, which excludes Redfin Now, Mortgage and otherservices, was $89 million and grew 36% year-over-year. Brokerage revenue, or revenue from home sales closed by our agents, was up 37%, drivenby a 34% growth in brokerage transactions. Revenue per brokerage transaction grew 2% year-over-year. We reduced our sell-side commissions to1% in 18 additional markets the beginning of the fourth quarter. To offset this reduction in brokerage revenue, we reduced refunds to homebuyers,doing so slightly ahead of the continued mix shift to our faster-growing listings business. Revenue from our partner agents grew 24%, driven by20% growth in partner transactions and a 3% increase in revenue per partner transaction. Other segment revenue of $7.1 million was up from $1.6million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This revenue includes Redfin Now sales as well as revenue from title services, mortgage originations and otherproducts. We had no revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 from Redfin Now or mortgage originations. These businesses are new.     Gross profit was $29 million, up 37% year-over-year, including a very small contribution to gross profit from Redfin Now. Gross margin on thecombined partner and brokerage business, known as our real estate segment, was nearly flat, increasing 10 basis points from 33.4% in the fourthquarter of 2016 to 33.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was driven by a 59 basis point decrease in personnel expenses, a 30 basis point decreasein occupancy expenses and a 19 basis point decrease in stock-based compensation. It was partially offset by a 50 basis point increase in transactionbonuses and a 33 basis point increase in tours and field events.     We continued to invest in the businesses accounted for in our other segment, including Redfin Now, Mortgage and title services. We don't breakout the results for these businesses, but combined, they lost $524,000 in gross profit compared to a gross profit loss of $475,000 in the fourthquarter of 2016.     Operating expenses showed continued leverage, growing 18% year-over-year, representing 33% of revenue, down from 40% of revenue 1 yearago. This reflects our continued commitment to growing our fixed costs slower than revenue, and we expect this trend to continue into 2018.     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Our net loss, including stock-based compensation and depreciation, was $1.8 million, an improvement from a $5.3 million net loss in the fourthquarter of 2016. The new tax regulation had no impact on our fourth quarter earnings because we currently hold a full valuation allowance againstour deferred tax assets and liabilities.     Diluted net loss per common share was $0.02 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with an $8.08 diluted net loss per common share in thefourth quarter of 2016. The prior year loss was primarily driven by the fair market value feature of our redeemable convertible preferred stock whichconverted to common stock in connection with our IPO. Excluding the impact of the redeemable convertible preferred stock, which is now convertedto common stock, adjusted diluted net loss per common share for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $0.08. Adjusted diluted net loss per commonshare included stock-based compensation.     Before I move to our 2018 outlook, I'd like to briefly recap our full year 2017 performance. Our customers booked over $21 billion in real estatetransactions. Compared to a 5% commission, we saved our brokerage customers over $121 million. We delivered full year revenue of over $370million, up 38% year-over-year and gross profit of over $111 million, up 35%. Our total operating expenses grew 21%, and net loss for the yearnarrowed from $22.5 million in 2016 to $15.0 million in 2017.     Now turning to our financial expectations for the first quarter of 2018. Revenue is expected to be between $74.6 million and $78.4 million, representingyear-over-year growth between 25% and 31%. We expect Redfin Now to account for $2.3 million to $3.1 million of total revenue. Net loss is expectedto be between $38.7 million and $35.9 million compared with a $28.1 million net loss in the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, our losses areseasonal, driven in part by the timing of our revenue. From 2015 to 2017, between 15.4% and 16.2% of our full year revenue came in the first quarter.And March is, by far, the largest month of the first quarter given the seasonal ramp. It's also the month that we have the least revenue visibility toas we speak today. This guidance includes approximately $4.5 million of stock-based compensation and $1.8 million of depreciation and amortization.It assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements are concluded and thatthere are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates.     And with that, we will open up to your questions."

So we expect inventory to continue to decline and that the market will continue to get more competitive, as I said in the preparedremarks. We do think, though, that we can increase close rate modestly over the next 12 months. And the reason we think that is that every timewe've made a change like this in the past, we've had a similar effect. So if you look at cohorts of agents who had fewer customers in 2017, you seethat those agents closed at a higher rate, even if you look in markets where inventory was extremely low. If you look at years where it was also astrong seller's market, but we limited the number of customers each agent met, we saw higher close rates. So I think this is going to have a positiveimpact on close rate. What isn't understood is how positive that will be. So the market is going to work against us, and we're just going to fight thetide."

There are ways to save agents' time and then there are ways to increase close rate. And mostof our labor-saving software is really focused on the support staff because those folks are performing a high number of repetitive tasks where wecan either automate it or simplify it so that we can take $10, $20, $50, $100 out of the deal by just having fewer support staff per agent. But withthe agent, the name of the game is really to increase close rate. And the way that we do that is giving agents better tools to serve our customers.So if you notice that a customer is online on our website, but just hasn't been active with the brokerage, that's a signal that you probably need toreach out and see what's going on. If you notice that the customer is searching often but hasn't set up online alerts, that's a sign that you need todo that for the customer. So I think most of the software that we're developing over the course of this year is to personalize the service so that weknow more about what that customer needs at any given moment and can be there to deliver that service at the right time. And we think that itcan significantly increase close rate because we still spend most of our time with people who don't end up buying a house."

Making a reasonable range of assumptions, it looks like you're predictingthat real estate revenue is going to grow high teens, maybe to low 20s, something like that, which is a pretty sharp deceleration from the growthover the last 4 quarters. Is that really all due to macro conditions? We've seen the January housing supply indicators get tougher. Is that -- and -- isthat what's really driving it? So just spell that out a little bit more.

Certainly, many of us still live in the Bay Area have seen the billboards. Justcurious, from a quarter or 2 back, are you finding this to be a more expensive endeavor than maybe originally planned and you -- did you plan onaccelerating these investments on the advertising side or has this been kind of in the books? I know you mentioned this is the largest campaignthat you've run. I'm just curious if you could kind of walk through how you're thinking about the expense structure."

So we just wanted to put everyone on notice that if we see that opportunity to grow faster,we'll take it. And the reason that we have increasing confidence in advertising is because we have started to see some durable awareness gainsfrom ads that we ran last year. We have a campaign that we really believe in. The simplicity of the 1% message lends itself well to billboards andradio ads. And we think it's really going to result directly in more sales. So just having seen some encouraging results, we wanted to maintain ourdiscipline this year, but also let everyone know that there is the possibility that we will invest more aggressively in the future. So that is the mostlikely outcome that we would see an opportunity in future years. It's also possible that we would say, ""Actually, this is going so well. We want toinvest more aggressively now."" But that's not what we had in mind when we prepared the remarks. So our main thesis was that, in future years,we could see a larger opportunity to advertise.

Glenn, it sounds like you guys aren't planning on doing the 1% across the boardanytime soon. But just 2 questions. Do you ever envision a day where that 1% would be across the board in the U.S.? And then I guess, secondly,as the industry starts to mimic your pricing, do you ever envision maybe even going below that 1% percent mark?"
24,64389860,REDFIN CORP,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, RDFN.OQ",Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call,Glenn Kelman,Redfin Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",True,False,"Interesting question. So first of all, we are always focused on lowering our cost of goods sold so that we can expand our addressable market, sellhomes that are very inexpensive and still make a profit or pass the savings on to our customer by offering 1% to more markets. But I don't thinkwe'll do that in the next 6 months or 12 months. That's a long-term grind to make that pricing work in places where homes sell for $150,000 a year.We do think that more competitors are going to try to match that price. That is obviously ground on which we like to fight because we've been sofocused on efficiency for so long. So if the market begins to agree that consumers really care about price, I think that's a world where Redfin canreally prosper more than any other brokerage. To go below 1% is possible. I think you have to start thinking about other ways to sell houses thataren't so labor-intensive. A long time ago, for example, we asked customers to host their own open houses. And back in that day, they did not likeit. They want us to be there, putting the directionals out on the corner and bringing in flowers and everything else. So I think it's possible that thereis a new type of customer out there who wants a new product, but I would think about pricing that's significantly below 1% as inviting a new listingproduct. It would be a counterpart on the other end to the concierge product that we developed, which really is serving a customer who wantsjust a new level of convenience. And we thought we could take the economic advantage we've developed to actually let us invest more in thehouse, more in the service than other brokerage traditionally have. So we would just take that and look at it a different way if we were to try to gosignificantly below 1%."

How much of that -- what should we think about as being sort of the underlying driversfrom that -- for that? Is it an increase in the value of the homes being sold? Is it a function of moving up market in certain areas? And then as wethink about the efforts around driving more traffic to the site and sort of brand-building, should we expect that that's largely going to take theform of television advertising? Or do you see opportunities in online beyond the performance-based advertising that you've been doing thus far?."

I may ask Chris to weigh in with some additional detail. But the pricing or the revenue per transaction isreally a function of mix shift. So we save customers a lot of money when they sell a house through us. We save them a still significant, but lessmoney, when they buy a house through us. And so we're always calibrating our pricing, especially the refunds that we give to buyers, there's acommission that's paid to us as the buyer's agent, and then we give a portion of that to the buyer. And we change that amount as the mix shiftstowards listings. So we're trying to keep revenue per transaction steady quarter through quarter through quarter. And if the listing business growsa little faster than we expected, then we have to lower the commission refund a little faster than we expected. And so what you saw happen nowis just pricing ahead of that. So we know that listings are going to continue to grow very quickly, and we wanted to price ahead of that. And I wouldexpect that, that will neutralize as listing share catches up to that so that revenue per transaction basically remains constant. And what that meansis that much of our gross margin upside comes from lowering cost per transaction, not trying to increase prices on the consumer. I think it's possiblethat we can move up market. Generally, as we do that, we also move down market. We're fairly acquisitive about share. And so if we sell moreexpensive houses, it gives us a little bit of latitude to also take on customers who are buying more affordable houses, too. Chris, do you want toadd anything to that?     11     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Everyone sees that coming. More peopleare spending more time online. It's just that the major Internet platforms are pricing that into their ads. So we will probably see some of our mediamove online, but we're still definitely interested in learning about all the ways we can reach people through traditional media. So we've just begunwith radio and outdoor. And the reason we did that is we just thought we had such a good message for, say, a billboard.

So I just want to make sure I understand how the seller mix, which sounds like it's still growing as an overall mix versus the buyer mix, how theseller mix actually impacts the gross margins of the business. Could you have higher agent productivity because you're more or less guaranteeda sale representing the seller and you don't have as much of an impact from the homebuyer taking longer to find a house or close on a house? SoI'm just trying to understand the dynamics of the growing seller mix and how that impacts the gross margin."

And that's just because our fees are higherwhen we represent a buyer than when we represent a seller. We keep more of the commission in that situation. So what you're seeing as we havemore and more listings as a percentage of our overall sales is that we have to keep more of the commission that is given to us, rather than refundingsuch a large portion to the buyer. And that's how we keep revenue per transaction between buyers and sellers basically flat year-to-year. And whathappened last year is we got a little bit behind that because listings grew a little faster than we expected. And now what we're doing is trying toprice just a little bit ahead of that, but the goal is to keep revenue per transaction flat. And trying to answer your question, just remember, we makemore money from buyers than sellers. So as the mix shifts toward sellers, we have to charge buyers just a little bit more to pay for that.     12     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

And that's, aswe said, because the seller is so much more price-sensitive. She signs a contract before listing her house. She agrees to a price before listing herhouse when she chooses an agent. And so in Denver and San Diego and Seattle and places like that, we had run 1% pricing for years. And wecarefully studied whether that hurt our share among buyers, whether it helped our share among sellers. And what we determined was that, overall,it had a positive effect. And it's possible, of course, that as the market shifts, which inevitably it will, toward buyers, that we want to recalibrate thatpricing to benefit the buyer more.
