Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call today.     2017 was a good year for Stepan Company. The company delivered record reported and adjusted net income for 2017, and we now have hadrecord income for 7 of the last 10 years. Reported net income in 2017 was $91.6 million, up 6% versus last year despite the $14.9 million unfavorablenet impact of the new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's legislation.     Adjusted net income was $108.7 million, 11% higher than 2016. Adjusted net income as a percent of net sales was 5.7%, an increase of 10 basispoints versus 2016.     Improved product mix, increased asset utilization and enhanced internal efficiencies continued to drive results. Both Surfactants and Polymersbenefited from our diversification strategy, and we anticipate further contributions in 2018.     2     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Sales benefited from our diversification efforts into Functional Products, higher sales within the household,industrial and institutional end markets and continued growth in more specialized applications.     During the fourth quarter of 2017, the company approved a plan to restructure a portion of our production activities at our Fieldsboro facility. Wetransitioned impacted products to other Stepan sites in North America, and we expect to benefit from improved asset utilization and a reducedcost base going forward.     Polymers delivered its second best full year results despite increased competitive pressure and higher raw material costs within our North AmericanPolyol business. Global Polyol volumes were up slightly, despite share loss in North America. The market for insulation materials remains strongdue to continued global energy-conservation efforts.     The definitive agreement with BASF to acquire its surfactant production facility in Ecatepec, Mexico is on track to close this quarter. We believe theacquisition will significantly enhance our market position and supply capabilities for surfactants in Mexico and position us to grow in both theconsumer and functional end markets.     Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on Stepan's common stock of $0.225 per share, payable on March 15, 2018.     At this point, I would like Matt to walk through a few more details about our fourth quarter and full year results."
3,64388371,STEPAN CO.,02/22/2018," 3:00PM, SCL",Q4 2017 Stepan Co Earnings Call,Matthew John Eaken,Stepan Company,"Corporate Controller, Interim VP & CFO",False,True,"Thank you, Quinn. My comments will generally follow the slide presentation. Let's start with Slide #5 to recap the quarter. As Quinn stated, adjustednet income for the fourth quarter 2017 was a record $24.6 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, a 100% increase versus $12.3 million, or $0.52 perdiluted share, in 2016. Because adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure, we provide full reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measuresand these can be found in Appendix 2 of the presentation and Table 2 of the press release.     Specifically, regarding adjustments to reported net income, this quarter included deferred compensation income of $1 million, or $0.04 per dilutedshare, compared to deferred compensation expense of $2.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Naturally, all employeecompensation expenses are reflected in our normal operating income. However, we allow employees the opportunity to defer their incentivepayouts until some future date and the future payment changes based on the company's stock price. When the stock price declines, income isgenerated as we mark this item to market value. Because the future liability of employee compensation only changes consistently with the changein the stock price, we exclude this item from our operational discussion.     The new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation resulted in a net onetime expense of $14.9 million, or $0.64 per diluted share. The current quarterresults also included $800,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, of after-tax business restructuring charges. These charges related to decommissioningcosts from the closure of our Canadian plant announced in 2016 and severance costs associated with the partial restructuring of our Fieldsborosite. We expect an additional $2 million to $3 million of after-tax restructuring charges in 2018 related to decommissioning cost at these plants.     Slide 6 shows the total company earnings bridge for the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, and breaks down the increase inadjusted net income. Because this is net income, the figures noted here are on an after-tax basis. Fourth quarter 2016 results were negativelyimpacted by $8.9 million of pretax nonrecurring costs, of which $8.3 million impacted Surfactants and $600,000 impacted Polymers. In addition,fourth quarter 2017 results were positively impacted by $4.7 million of pretax income related to the favorable resolution of a Surfactant productclaim in Europe. We will cover each segment in more detail, but Surfactants and Polymers were up, while Specialty Products was down versus theprior year.     The bridge on Slide #6 excludes the impact of the new tax reform legislation because the onetime cost was excluded to arrive at adjusted netincome. Therefore, excluding the onetime impact, our effective tax rate did not significantly impact results for the quarter. For the full year, oureffective tax rate was 34.3% in 2017 compared to 24.3% in 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

The onetime net impact was comprised of a $19.4 million transition tax expenseon certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a $4.5 million favorable impact related to the remeasurement of a netU.S. deferred tax liabilities at a lower future corporate tax rate. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 was partially offset by favorablenonrecurring discrete items.     We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 23% in 2018.     Our material on Slide #7 focuses solely on the Surfactant results of the segment for the fourth quarter. Surfactant net sales were $324.2 million, up15% from the same quarter a year ago. Prices were 11% higher due to the pass-through of certain raw material costs. Sales volumes were up 2%,mainly due to higher demand in the Functional Product end markets and higher sales through our distribution partners. This increase in volumewas partially offset by lower consumer product commodity volumes. The positive translation impact of a weaker U.S. dollar increased sales by theremaining 2%. The segment delivered $28.3 million of operating income, a 94% increase over the prior year quarter, mainly driven by $8.3 millionof nonrecurring expenses in the prior year, settlement of a European product claim, savings from the Canadian plant shutdown and improvedproduct mix and growth in agriculture end markets in Europe. The prior year acquisition in Brazil also contributed positively.     In the bridge, we showed North America and Asia in the same category because our Surfactant business in Asia is relatively small and much of theSurfactant production in the region is used to support business in the United States. North American results were positively impacted by higherdemand for oilfield products, sales through our distribution channel as well as savings from the Canadian plant shutdown. Latin American resultswere up slightly due to accretive income related to the Brazil acquisition in 2016. European results were higher year-over-year due to improvedproduct mix and growth in agricultural chemicals.     The $11.4 million of nonrecurring costs primarily relate to the year-over-year impact of the Surfactant product claim commitments in Europe,recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the positive impact due to the favorable resolution of one of the claims in the fourth quarter of 2017.     Now turning to Polymers on Slide 8. Net sales were $131.1 million, up 13% from the same quarter a year ago. An 8% increase in selling prices wasrelated to the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Sales volume was up 1%, primarily due to higher European Rigid Polyol volume and higherglobal Specialty Polyol volume, which was partially offset by lower North American Rigid Polyol and phthalic anhydride volumes. Foreign exchangetranslation positively impacted net sales by 4%. Operating income was $19 million compared to $16.5 million in the same quarter last year. Theincrease was primarily due to a 2% increase in global polyol volumes.     Global Rigid Polyol volumes increased despite share loss in North America. Global Specialty Polyol volumes increased supported by the capacityaddition in Poland. Operating income in North America was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs during the quarter. European resultscontinued to improve due to higher Rigid and Specialty Polyol volumes and slightly higher margins. Phthalic anhydride results increased despitelower volume and margins due to the nonrecurrence of costs associated with the scheduled maintenance shutdown in the fourth quarter of 2016.The nonrecurring expense of $600,000 represents remediation costs in the fourth quarter of 2016.     Specialty Product operating income decreased $2 million for the quarter, primarily due to the timing of orders in our flavor business and lowervolume and margins in our food business.     We will now take a moment on the Slide #9 to recap the full year 2017 financial performance. Adjusted net income was, again, a record of $108.7million, or $4.65 per diluted share, an 11% increase from $98.2 million, or $4.25 per diluted share, in 2016.     Surfactant operating income was a record $120 million, up 20% from 2016. The increase was due to $10.2 million of nonrecurring expenses in theprior year, settlement of a European product claim in 2017, growth in key global markets and savings from the Canadian plant shutdown.     The Polymer segment delivered $82.8 million of operating income, a 14% decrease versus prior year. Polymer results for 2017 were the secondbest on record. The decrease versus last year was primarily due to higher raw material costs despite higher European Rigid Polyol and globalSpecialty Polyol volumes.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Slide #10 shows the total company earnings bridge for the full year 2017 compared to 2016. Like the quarterly bridge, the figures here are notedon an after-tax basis.     Turning to Slide #11. It is important to note that our balance sheet remains strong as we had no net debt at year-end. The company generated$101 million of free cash flow during 2017, a 10% increase versus prior year. The company entered into a $350 million unsecured revolving line ofcredit in January 2018, which will provide the company with flexibility to fund future growth opportunities.     In 2017, we also increased our cash dividends for the 50th consecutive year, placing us in a very select group of companies.     Beginning on Slide #12, Quinn will now address our path forward to further increase shareholder value."
4,64388371,STEPAN CO.,02/22/2018," 3:00PM, SCL",Q4 2017 Stepan Co Earnings Call,"F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.",Stepan Company,"Chairman, President & CEO",False,True,"Thank you, Matt. After record results in 2016 and 2017, we believe our Surfactant business will continue to benefit from our diversification effortsinto Functional Products, new technologies, expanded share into our broad customer base globally and the stabilization of commodity surfactantvolumes.     However, headwinds in our North American Polymer business related to last year and lower margins will continue to challenge us in 2018. Resultswill benefit from the lower U.S. corporate tax rate. Longer term we believe that our strategy to leverage our market leadership positions to diversifyour products and end markets, to collaborate with customers on new chemistries and to focus on operational excellence will drive shareholdervalue.     Turning to Slide #13. We believe that our market leadership position in several of our businesses is a strong foundation from which we can grow.First, we are the largest producer of anionic and amphoteric surfactants for the merchant market in the Western Hemisphere. And we will advancethis position with the acquisition of the BASF plant and associated business in Ecatepec, Mexico. We believe our commodity anionic position shouldstabilize and potentially grow in 2018.     Next, we are the second-largest supplier of biodegradable fabric softener actives globally. Esterquats are the preferred technology in the developedworld and are being adopted in the developing world. With plants in all 4 regions of the world, Stepan is positioned to capture market growth.     Finally, as a leading producer of rigid polyester polyols globally, we remain optimistic about the continued growth of the market due to increasedinsulation standards, energy-conservation efforts and growth in construction.     Although we experienced headwinds in our North American Polyol business during 2017, our European business remains strong.     Now turning to Slide #14. Our diversification efforts continue to be a key component of our long-term strategy. First, over the last several years,we have worked very closely with many large agricultural companies, and we believe Stepan chemistries will be included in many of their productlaunches over the next 36 months.     With regards to surfactant chemistries for oilfield, Stepan has a relatively low market share today. But we have significant opportunities to grow.Stepan's portfolio of chemistries including biocides and foamers are well suited for use in the production of oil. And in fact, volumes on thesechemistries grew over 20% last year, albeit from a small base.     Next, growth within the Tier 2 and Tier 3 customer base continues to be a key priority for our Surfactant business. And our sales to this segmentgrew 8% in 2017.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 628                Our Surfactant customer portfolio includes many large consumer product customers, which cover a significant part of our overhead. But today,Tier 2 and Tier 3 customers generate 35% to 40% of our Surfactant operating income. As such, our strategy to expand this segment to reach, todelight and to acquire more new customers, local heroes, if you will, around the world is the top priority for our Surfactant team.     Our knowledge and expertise in applications within the consumer product industry positions us well to help smaller companies create productsso that they can compete and win in their local markets. In order to reach these customers effectively, we are adding sales personnel and enhancingour digital strategy.     Finally, with respect to our CASE Polyol business, we experienced double-digit growth in 2017. We remain optimistic about the growth of the globalmarket and our business, in particular.     Production from our new specialty polyol reactor in Poland, which began production in the fall of 2016, contributed to the strong volume growthduring 2017. In addition, a new specialty reactor in Columbus, Georgia began production in January of this year.     Turning to Slide 15. Collaborative chemistry is a key foundation of our long-term strategy. First, as a leader in the Rigid Polyol market, we continueto work on developing the next generation of value-added technologies for our customer base. We are excited about a few advances in our researchpipeline today. We continue to innovate and create more environmentally friendly green solvent chemistries, including our partnership withElevance, a metathesis-based technologies for the agricultural market. We recently launched a new solvent for the personal care end market thatallows customers to replace more expensive solubilizers while maintaining performance and reducing cost for liquid cleansing applications, suchas shampoo, body wash and hand soaps.     Finally, within the oil market, stimulation segment is projected to grow at 13% per year over the next 5 years. Although U.S. oil producers havereduced the cost of hydraulic fracking over the last decade, new chemistries can help reduce production costs further. Stepan has developedpatent-pending technology for use in fracturing including flowback modifiers and friction-reducer boosters that offer significant cost advantages.Use of biocides is growing in the fracturing market due to regulations that restrict the use of freshwater, which should provide opportunities forour biocidal quaternary products as is in blends.     Turning to Slide 16. Our continued focus on operational excellence is a key aspect of our long-term strategy. We continue to actively pursueopportunities to reduce excess capacity in our networks. Our 2017 results benefited significantly from previous actions in Canada, Brazil andSingapore, and will from our plans to restructure our Fieldsboro plant. We will continue to examine our asset base for opportunities to furtheroptimize and improve our capacity utilization and more effectively serve our customers around the world.     Next, we are delivering on our plans to increase our polymer production capacity by focusing on process improvements. We recently completeddebottlenecking project at our Wesseling plant, which should increase capacity by 20%. We believe we have further opportunities to increase ourpolyol capacity at our Millsdale and Wesseling sites in 2018.     DRIVE, our internal efficiency program, is now ingrained in our culture and is part of the way we do business. The DRIVE program will continue tofocus on supply chain optimization, procurement opportunities and SG&A expense reduction.     Finally, we will continue to focus on improving Stepan's working capital and free cash flow by standardizing and streamlining our processes andby optimizing our inventory position.     The market provides challenges and opportunities. We feel we are well positioned to capture opportunities for you, our shareholders.     This concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we would like to turn the call over for questions. Lena, please review the instructions for thequestion portion of today's call.     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

If we look at 2018, the cost savings that we will generate will primarily be offset by some of thetransition costs in 2018. We anticipate it to be beneficial in 2019 going forward. So minimal impact in '18. In terms of capacity utilization of ourNorth American network, we're getting to a position where we think we still have some excess capacity that allow us to grow in the marketplace.But we have a comfortable amount of excess capacity today the way I would describe it."

And then on the Polymers business, just trying to dig in a little bit on the challenges that you're dealing with in North America. Youmentioned some share losses.

So every year we have an objective that's passed on throughout the company that we want to try to generate $25 million of benefits from ourDRIVE program. And we break that down into kind of which we're looking for at least $10 million of cash savings. Generally targeting kind of anumber little bit higher than that. So $10 million to $15 million of cash savings, $25 million of benefits. And we look at that trying to offset otherinflationary aspects of our business. So we feel good about the opportunities in the pipeline, and we believe that will help us maintain our currentcost structure."

I think generally speaking with the improving economy, we would tend to think that most of our input prices would potentially increase. Asyou are aware, and I think as most shareholders are aware, that we have a large percent of our contracts are tied to and include raw materialpass-through agreement. So we believe we can maintain our margins, potentially increase those in the Surfactant market in 2018. But we do believethat there will be some challenges to do that in our Polymer business.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.
