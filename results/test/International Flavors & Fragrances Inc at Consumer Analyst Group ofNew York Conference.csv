So I'm sure many of you will remember the wonderful dinner that IFF hosted for us at CAGNY last year. We were treatedto an interactive education on the science and artistry of the flavor and fragrance world. Since then, the company has accelerated its growth againstthe backdrop of decelerating industry volume trends, thanks in part to a keen focus on health and wellness and the resurgence in demand fromlocal and regional customers. We're delighted to have both the company's CEO, Andreas Fibig; and CFO, Rich O'Leary, here with us today. Thankyou both for joining us at CAGNY again this year."
1,64390302,INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS &amp; FRAGRANCES,02/22/2018," 8:00PM, IFF",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Andreas Fibig,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,Chairman and CEO,False,True,"Thank you, Lauren, for the intro and good afternoon to everybody. I would like to encourage you to read first the cautionary statement before weproceed for the presentation.     What we want to do today and what we have on the agenda is, we want to show you what kind of progress we have made in terms of executingtowards our Vision 2020. We want to show you as well what are the adaptations we have done last year to make sure that we are really current inthe things we're doing, particularly on the pipeline and on the customer side. I want to show you what our go-forward priorities are. And we willgive you a sneak peek what we have in our pipeline, what kind of products we have to help our customers, and you have seen many of them overthe last 2 days, to be successful in the marketplace. And then certainly, we want to show you the financial performance.     Let me start with a slide we have built in 2015. That's when we started to roll out our Vision 2020, our strategy for the next 5 years. We are now wellwithin the planning cycle. The first pillar was and it's still the innovation piece. How can we make sure that we come up with the right amount oftechnology and molecules and products to help our customers to be successful in the marketplace? I want to remind you we spent between 8%and 9% of our sales in R&D to come up with these solutions. And we're really looking for differentiation here. We have defined where are the areasand the regions of the world where we want to win. In particular, North America was on the list, but also Africa and Middle East. We have definedwhat are the core lists, which are relevant for us going forward. And what are the customers we really aim for, whether they are big or midmarketcustomers. And then how can we strengthen our portfolio in a sense of geographic presence, but in a sense of technology as well? And that's whatI would like to show you in the next slide.     That's what happened until end of last year already. Our pipeline in terms of innovation and molecules is probably as filled and as rich as it wasnever before in the history of IFF. We came up with 11 new captive fragrance ingredients, all patent protected, 9 new naturals, and with the firstcradle-to-cradle fragrance as well to underline the sustainability efforts we're doing as a company as well.     Technologies like modulation and encapsulation are growing double-digit and they are by far not at the end of their life cycle. We are still innovatingin these areas to come up with better solutions for the customers and the consumers. We have made considerable progress in terms of our homemarket, North America. We are meanwhile the #1 flavors house for the mid-tier market. And mid-tier is so important because that's where thegrowth is at the moment, particularly in the food area. We have made also good progress in Africa and Middle East.     2     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

And we made progress in a sense of expanding our portfolio as well intoan adjacent area, which is the active cosmetic ingredients. And you see it, we have made 5 acquisitions since 2015. Some of them are in adjacentareas like Lucas Meyers and PowderPure. Some like Fragrance Resources, Ottens and David Michael are more in the traditional area to strengthenoutreach to certain customers, but I will come to that.     So you see good progress here on the execution of our 2020 strategy.     Coming to the financials. We have posted the 6% 3-year component average growth rate on the sales side, which is certainly outperforming themarket because you have seen that, particularly in the last 2 to 3 years, there was not much volume growth with many of our customers. And alsoan 8% 3 years' CAGR on the EPS front as well.     And that turns to the total shareholder return over the last 3 years, which certainly has outperformed our benchmark, the S&P 500, but our maincompetitors in Europe as well. So you see so far we are making good progress in a time which was very, very volatile for us because not as muchgrowth as we saw when we started to come up with our vision. And currency with the U.S. dollar stronger than we had planned for as well. Andwe're actually very happy right now that this tide is turning and we have a little bit of a tailwind here.     Let me talk about the go-forward strategies. What do we want to achieve in the next 2 to 3 years until 2020?     We've looked at how can we adapt our strategy from 2015. So what stays and what has to be adapted. First of all, driving differentiation is still avery super-important headline for us because innovations drive our business, innovation drives the business of our customers. And that's the reasonwhy we want to stay focused and even being more differentiated than we have been in the past, and the examples will come. We really want tobalance our customers. You might remember from our last presentation -- or presentations, we have 50-50 small customers, local customers, 50%global big customers. And that's our base. What we try to do right now is to look how can we supplement our customer base with more of themidsize customers to make sure that we capture the growth, which is in these companies, whether it's in the U.S., in Western Europe, but in theemerging market as well. And I will talk to that in a minute.     Maximizing the portfolio. So really looking what are the categories we really want to go forward? Where is the profitability which we can moveforward? And interesting enough -- and I was very happy that Kiehl's has their little outlet over there, which is a customer as well -- these are areaswhich are incredibly profitable also for us to deliver our active cosmetic ingredients for them to come up with good solutions, and then generatereturn to make sure that we keep our cost base as much under control as we can.     Let me start with the R&D piece. And I'm really excited about it. What we have done is, we have looked how we can focus our R&D in the areaswhich really matter. What you see here is certainly naturals because you have heard it probably from many of the food companies, clean label,naturals -- also in the cosmetic sector is super important. So focus on this part, active cosmetics, I talked to that. And health and nutrition and,particularly the health area super important for us as well. And then delivery system modulation and ingredients, that's kind of a standard for usbecause we believe that, particularly in natural modulation like sweetness modulation or enhancers or delivery systems, capsule systems forfragrances, we're really on forefront compared to our competitors.     So let me give you a couple of examples. The first one is the fragrance ingredients. The fragrance ingredients are usually the molecules we comeup with and it takes 2 to 5 years to invent some of them, to come up with a patented molecule, which our perfumers can use to come up with newfragrance solutions. And if you take Fine Fragrance, then have usually 80 different molecules in one of these fragrances. And you need new moleculesso that the palette of your perfumers gets bigger and bigger so that they can pick and choose and come up with really great, great, great solutions.     Here you see fantastic pipeline, rollout of the first molecules and you see at the last line, we have the strongest pipeline in our history and we expectto launch 8 to 12 molecules until 2021. And again, it's a 2- to 5-year cycle to come up with these new molecules as there went a lot of work intothat to get them to the state where they are right now.     The next one, clean label. Super important topic for all of the food companies. What can we do to help the food companies, small or big, to comeup with clean label solutions. We acquired a company last year in Oregon called PowderPure. What they take, they take food swipe screens -- and     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

So they take, let's say, food swipes from tomatoes, pepper. And then they have a dryingtechnology called Infidri, which is a patented technology which takes very softly, very gently the water out of the system, out of the product andmakes powder out of it. It is 100% natural, 100% organic and you can use it for taste solutions and for color solutions at the same time. And this isa super important platform for us for clean label. But mainly for some of our cosmetics as well, and we're talking right now what can we do in termsof lipsticks, even flavors for dental solution or for oral care solutions. So it's important technology, and you will see over the next years more tocome out of this technology.     The next is graying hair. It's certainly an important topic for most of us, despite Mike. He was certainly not in the clinical trial. But we have roundabout 8 years -- or took us almost 8 years to come up with a solution here with a molecule, which is a biomimetic peptide which can reverse thegraying of the hair. This molecule is not on the market. Next quarter we will roll it out to all the beauty companies like the L'Oreals of world to lookwhat we can do to put this into action with some of their solutions. So you see very much still in an adjacent area where we were not before. Butnow we are moving into the cosmetic area much stronger because we believe there is good profitability to be get out of this segment.     The next thing, again, active cosmetics. Many of the millennials, certainly not me, but the millennials, they do selfies like there's no tomorrow. Andwhat is the statistic? 75,000 selfies in their lifetime. And what is an issue is that it particularly adds to pollution. In many of the cities of the world,you get a little bit of an oily skin. And we have developed out of an Australian lemon myrtle 4 biological targets we can use to effectively reversethat oiliness on the skin. And we will find a solution in some of our customer products as well. And we believe it's spot on, because it's natural, itcomes from one of our natural facilities in Australia. We're the only one who have access to them. And it is towards the target group of the millennials,which is certainly a growing group as well to make a good business proposal here.     So you see even in the active cosmetics area, good progress in terms of our pipeline. And you will hear more over next couple of months whetherwe are buying into a technology solution or coming up with our own solutions. Stay tuned, more to come, particularly in the next 6 months.     Balanced customer. I talked briefly about it. 50-50, at the moment 50% of our sales was global customers, 50% was local and regional customers.So what are these local customers doing or what do they need different from the big companies? What we see is that many of them like to workwith smaller companies, smaller outlets, because they play a bigger part with them. They like to have customized service levels. They like morespeed in the development of products. And it's very, very clear. If somebody comes like a Chobani and they want to have a new blueberry flavor,just picking an example, they want to have the solution maybe in 2 or 3 weeks to launch this product quite quickly, which is very different fromother bigger companies where it takes more time.     So we said what can we do at IFF to build an outlet, which exactly can serve the midmarket? And we created a platform. It's called Tastepoint herein the U.S. And I can tell you what we have seen so far is double-digit growth out of Tastepoint. So we took 2 of our acquisitions, Ottens and DavidMichael, both in Philly. We united them under the label of Tastepoint and rolled it out since last year and it is growing quite dramatically comparedto the core business. And I'll show you a quick video of what we did here.     (presentation)"
2,64390302,INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS &amp; FRAGRANCES,02/22/2018," 8:00PM, IFF",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Andreas Fibig,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,Chairman and CEO,False,True,"And so far, we see good success, double-digit growth in the U.S. market towards these customers. Now the challenge for the team is how can weroll it out on a global base? What can we do to do it in Europe and some of our other bigger markets as well? But we are not stopping in the U.S.We inaugurated a new creative center in Cairo, particularly for the North African customers. We're investing in Sri City, which is north of Chennai,into a new flavors and fragrance facility for our local customers in India, which is a super important market to us, double-digit growth as well. Andwe're building a new factory in China as well.     You see there is more to come, in particular, towards the small and midsized customers.     So how do we maximize the portfolio to harvest the profitability we need going forward? These are the 4 categories, particularly the first 3 wherewe put some emphasis on it because they're incredibly profitable for us and for our customers as well. I always touched on the active cosmetic     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

And I think the mostimportant thing is the value added here because that what makes the difference compared to regular seasoning solutions.     On generating return. We generated $125 million in total savings over the last 4 years -- over the last 3 years and that's '18, the estimate. We usedit to help to both for the bottom line but as well to look where can we invest it, particularly in the R&D field to make sure that we have enough drypowder in our pipeline. We did a couple of exercises with 0-based projecting, acquisition of integration synergies, procurement, the usual things.It's a lot of homework, but it's yielding results in the last 3 years and certainly going forward here as well.     So and that's already the summary of the first part of the presentation you see. We had our strategy in 2015. We executed on the strategy. Weadapted last year because of the volatility of the market. And you see the 4 new elements in there like drive differentiation, balance customers,maximize portfolio and generate return, they are all in the confines of our -- hovers on the confines of our 4 pillars.     And I hope that gives you an idea what we have done in the execution of these and what kind of results that has yielded so far.     But I know that Rich will talk about more results to come going forward. Rich?"
3,64390302,INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS &amp; FRAGRANCES,02/22/2018," 8:00PM, IFF",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Richard A. O'Leary,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,CFO and EVP,False,True,"Thanks, Andreas, and good afternoon to everybody. It's a pleasure to be here again. Somehow I missed the demo day for Greyverse in New York.So I'm going to have to get that the next time it comes around. It's my objective today, walk you through a quick recap on our 2017 results that weannounced last week, but the bulk of my discussion will be forward looking around 2018 and how we think about our financial perspectives andthe capital allocation on a long-term basis.     Under the recap, our 2017 results, again, on the right side, you see full year results on currency neutral basis, top line growth at 9%, includingacquisitions. Currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 5% during the year. And currency neutral EPS grew 9%. We did have the benefit inthe fourth quarter related to a substantially lower tax rate related to some valuation allowances that we eliminated in the fourth quarter. As I stepback and think about 2017, it was a solid year. I mean, we continue to make progress against our performance after 2 difficult years in 2015, 2016.I think we certainly exited 2017 with more momentum than what we saw entering 2017, the first half of the year. And I think that sets a goodfoundation for our plan in 2018 and going forward.     From a cash standpoint and cash generation, I'll talk about cash flows in a couple of slides, but overall when you think about our capital allocationand what we used cash for in 2017, from a CapEx standpoint, which is our first priority, what are we going to do to grow the organic business. Wespent about 4% of sales on CapEx in 2017. Andreas highlighted some of the key projects as we continue to make investments, particularly in GreaterAsia and our creative centers around the world.     From an M&A standpoint, as we talked about, we've spent a little over $200 million on the acquisitions of Fragrance Resources and PowderPure.Andreas certainly walked you through the strategic logic behind both of those acquisitions. And those 2 businesses on a run-rate basis are expectedto add about $90 million in revenue to our top line.     And the third key pillar of our capital allocation strategy, returning cash to our shareholders. A little over $260 million in cash returned to theshareholders in 2017 right within our long-term targets of 50% to 60% at 56% of sales. And we continue to make that a priority. And our cash flowsenable us to do that and balance the internal aspects of the business as well as our shareholders, stakeholders and their interest in our business.     So enough of the past looking backwards, let me just focus now going forward. This is a recap of our financial expectations and our projections for2018. On an adjusted currency neutral basis, we expect to have a top line growth of 3% to 5% in 2018, improve leverage in the business betweentop line and operating profit with operating profit on a currency neutral basis adjusted growing 5% to 7%. And a little bit of pressure betweenoperating profit and EPS, with EPS growing on a currency neutral basis 4% to 6%. The bit of the drag between operating profit and EPS, the effectivetax rate is expected to go up a little bit in 2018. We've got higher interest expense and lower pension income that are driving the deleveragebetween operating profit and EPS. But still good strong improved performance and sequential improvement from what we've seen from '15 to '16     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Currency expected to be a tailwind based on current exchange rates, a tailwind in 2018 versus a headwind in 2017, adding about 3percentage points to top line and about 1.5% to both operating profit and EPS. So on a reported basis adjusted, expect to see 6% to 8% top linegrowth in 2018, 6.5% to 8.5% on the operating profit line and 5.5% to 7.5% at the EPS line.     Two of our key priorities for -- from a financial perspective and operating perspective, 2 of our key focus areas for 2017, first -- or 2018, first, clearlycontinue to deliver on the operating profit acceleration. You can see on a reported basis, the improvement that we've made over the last 3 yearsexpect to make -- again, clearly 2015, 2016 were challenging years -- we made some improvement in 2017, and we really want to accelerate thatgrowth in 2018. And so including -- as I said on previous slide, including the favorable tailwinds we expect to get from a currency standpoint, Iexpect adjusted operating profit to grow between 6.5% and 8.5% this year.     That profitability in improvement and profitability in acceleration is really driven by top line growth that Andreas talked about earlier, driven bothby innovation as well as a balance in our customers, and as I said earlier I think from a macroeconomic standpoint, sort of big picture standpoint,we feel the foundation is stronger as we head into '18 than where we certainly were as we headed into 2017.     We will continue to focus on and manage the things that we can control our best, which is our productivity program, ZBB, and our spending as wemonitor performance on the top line in a margin standpoint and we balance our internal priorities with our external commitments.     2017, looking back, there is no other way to say this, but it was a disappointing year from a cash flow standpoint. Some of it was event driven,whether it is a litigation settlement and some of the cash outlays related to restructuring programs and profit improvement programs. But thesimplest measure of looking at our cash flow from operations as a percentage of adjusted net income, we were about 85% in 2017. Now for somebusinesses, that might be pretty good from a quality of earnings standpoint. Historically this business in our company, and that's not where wewant to be. So we're going to focus on improved cash flow generation and, particularly working capital in 2018. You see here it's going to encompassall 3 key elements of working capital whether it's accounts payable, accounts receivable and inventory. So I do expect to see cash flow fromoperations in 2018 much more in line with historical norms and at or above 100% conversion versus where we were in 2017.     Taking a step back and thinking more sort of big picture. Our priorities in terms of what we do with our cash flow haven't changed. Our first focusarea again is to grow our organic business and that's investing the necessary funds from a CapEx standpoint. Second, we want to continue toexpand on and execute against our M&A strategy. And, third return cash to our shareholders consistent with our 50% to 60% target. And thatframework hasn't changed, and I don't expect it to change going forward.     So deep in -- a little bit of a deep dive into those 3 elements. Again, here is a recap of CapEx. 2017, we came in 3.8%. That is below where we expectedto be, I expected it to be closer to 4.5% in 2017. Couple of big projects were delayed whether it was from a regulatory or approval process standpointor from an operational standpoint where we had to wait until the operations side of the business was ready to support the change in the CapExand transfer the business.     So '17 was below where we wanted to be. That's certainly going to put pressure on '18 and '19. You see here we expect to be somewhere between4% and 5% of sales into both 2018 and 2019. I would expect this to be at the higher end of those ranges certainly for 2018 given some of the bigprojects that Andreas alluded to earlier. And our ability to execute and move forward operationally on the CapEx in '18 and '19 will largely driveour ability to get back to a more normal level of CapEx of 3.5% of sales in 2020. And that's really our long-term expectation on needed CapEx tosupport the business going forward.     From an M&A standpoint with the 4, 5 deals we've done over the last 2 years -- 2.5 years since we announced Vision 2020, we are on target versusour long -- our Vision '20 target of adding between $0.5 billion and $1 billion in sales through our M&A program. We're about 60% of the waythrough the end of 2017. We're continuing to look at targets at various stages through our pipeline. The lenses that we look in terms of evaluatingtargets and evaluating M&A haven't changed in terms of the strategic drivers, where we see the value creation. And certainly from my perspective,the criteria we use to evaluate whether a deal is executable or not in terms of the financial returns, we have not changed that a bit from when westarted the journey 2.5 years ago.     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

The components and mix has changed over time. 2015, 2016, we were wellabove this 50% to 60% target. 2017, as I alluded to earlier, was about 56% split between, primarily dividend and share buybacks had come downsignificantly from prior year periods. For 2018, I would expect this to be in a similar range and somewhere between 50% and 60% with the primarydriver being dividends as opposed to share repurchases.     With that, let me turn it back over to Andreas."

Let me summarize what we have presented here so far. So what really makes us optimistic going forward towards '18 and thenthe last 2 years of our strategic planning cycle is we believe we have the right strategy in place. We're executing the strategy. We've demonstratedrobust progress in most of the elements and the pillars of the strategy. We've very focused priorities whether is it in the R&D piece or in the pipelineto come up with right solution for our customers, or whether it is the outreach to the new customer groups or more dynamic customer groups tomake sure that we really capture that growth as well. And as you have seen from Rich's presentation, we have made progress on the financial sideas well.     So that's what we wanted to present to you, our vision, our execution and how we see 2018 and probably, a little bit of a peek of '19 as well becausesome of it will basically reach into '19 as well. So thank you very much, and we are open for questions. Mike?"

What would be a typical rate of contribution?How do the economics work for that? And how much financial contribution does that kind of progress make? What impact does that have on you?"
7,64390302,INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS &amp; FRAGRANCES,02/22/2018," 8:00PM, IFF",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Andreas Fibig,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,Chairman and CEO,True,False,"That's a good question, but a hard question to answer as well because the quantity of the molecules is just one element. The second one is thequality and how fast and quickly a molecule is already used by the perfumers. So I can't answer that question. But it will help us to propel the $300million to $400 million Fine Fragrance business in a good growth rate going forward and all encumbered without going to every single moleculebecause it really depends how frequently it's used by the perfumers. But I can tell you we had in the past roundabout 1 to 2 new molecules andnow we're having a much higher rate. And we've adapted our ingredient strategy as well because we are selling some of our ingredients to othercompanies as well, even our competitors. And in the past, we've kept the captured molecules for a longer period just to ourselves. Now we havejust 6 to 12 months where we have them and then we sell them to the outside world as well, which helps us with our Ingredients sales and putsmore pressure on the internal organization as well to use them as long as they are really proprietary to them.     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

EBIT is bit of an extra situation because of the tax reform, but that will basically pan out over the next 1 or 2 years as well,which means basically in sales and operating profit, we are back to our long-term targets."

O'Leary,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,CFO and EVP,True,False,"Yes, I think for me, I would say the challenge in our primary objective in my mind for myself and Andreas is how do we balance the short-termprofitability versus the long-term goals of the business. And it's a constant conversation we are having across the executive committee as we getupdated views and evaluate the trade-offs. I think what's going to long term drive it is continue -- more sustainable growth on an ongoing basis.We'll continue to invest in innovation that will enable us to maintain a strong and improving sales mix. We continue to focus on productivity everyyear. But it's not -- I'm not going to sit here and tell you we're going to have another -- the kind of improvement we had over the last 6 or 7 years.That's where we have to manage it. We have to make sure that we continue to drive our productivity agenda so that we can be competitive in themarketplace and make then -- have the internal ability to fund incremental investments that are going to drive growth in the longer term."

So while we have a good pipeline in place as well to get andcreate some extra goals, particularly out of this area. Maybe there is one thing as we get frequently the question, are the smaller customers lessprofitable than the bigger customers? It's not the case. They're actually even slightly more profitable than the bigger ones, just as an FYI."

So could you talk more about kind of profit changes there may have been to drive thatbetter yield? And then 2 areas where you are reinvesting in the business outside of the CapEx you just talked about and R&D?"

What we did in terms of R&D, we have streamlined our R&D platforms. So we have now less platforms than we hadbefore, to really put the funds and the resources behind the most important projects. And I spent my life in research intense industries. It's aboutthe process and where you really put the money behind. And secondly, we have more invested into outside R&D like PowderPure. We bought thiscompany for, what is it, $55 million. And that's -- it's actually considered an R&D investment as well because we basically bought the technology.So if you would put these things we have done on the M&A side into the R&D budget, you actually would see a growth, but it's not reported likethat.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Just is there anything different in the environment that you see today versus 12 months ago, kind of the sustainability of the recent trendsand outlook, as you think, into later this year and '19?"
15,64390302,INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS &amp; FRAGRANCES,02/22/2018," 8:00PM, IFF",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Andreas Fibig,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,Chairman and CEO,True,False,"Let me start -- that's very important. Let me start with the big picture. Actually I went to a Goldman event, and we talked about GDP growth in allthe regions. And I think that Rich mentioned it. It's probably since 2006, the first time that we see all regions have good and solid growth in termsof GDP, which is seriously very helpful for us as well. So that's a positive momentum. The second positive momentum finally after so many yearswith currency drag, we have some tailwind here as well. And what we have seen in the fourth quarter already is the pickup in volume. And I canbe very blunt and very honest to you. We saw it at the beginning. Is it just an inventory rebuild for many of our customers. But I said it on theearnings call last week is what we see is it continues into the first quarter. So an elaborated guess is that we see some volume growth, in particularin some of the emerging markets like Brazil, it's coming back for us in the fragrance business and it's a super important market. So volume growthis happening. But what we see more is even more bifurcation of our customer growth. We have still customers, which have really a hard time togrow their business, maybe because of the categories, maybe because how they approach the market, but others are actually very, very, verysuccessful going forward. Let me take 2 of these companies, L'Oreal and Est�e Lauder, for example, it's just going very well and they are big customerof ours. So I think for us it's super important to figure out what are the right customers that we want to put our efforts behind and help them withall the solution going forward. So again, a lot of macro factors are now in our favor. And we see a volume pickup. But it's not unisonal, it dependsalso on the customer. I hope that helps."

Astrachan,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",Director,True,False,"Wanted to ask just firstly, how do you think about developing market growth? We have heard some companies talk about expectations forimprovement. I guess, how do you see it from where you stand? What might be a reasonable rate of growth as you sort of look out at that pieceof your business, which is obviously a pretty big chunk of what you do over the next year or 2 or 3? And then switching gears a bit, I wanted to askyou about consolidation within the space. Not specific to you all engaging in it, very broadly, how would you think about value-add and doingsomething like that where there would be, from a customer standpoint, opportunities to cross-sell products, create sweets, for example, of thingsbeyond just flavors and fragrances, and maybe, broadly as well how do you think about consolidation within the F&F Group inclusive of whetherthe customers who are all talking over the last few days and tomorrow about cost savings, productivity, how does that work in terms of trying tokeep a consolidated group of suppliers honest or do they invite more folks to start bidding on their business and, therefore, reducing the need orwant of consolidating?"
18,64390302,INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS &amp; FRAGRANCES,02/22/2018," 8:00PM, IFF",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Andreas Fibig,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,Chairman and CEO,True,False,"Okay. That's a lot of questions, Mark. Let me try to answer them all. Let's start with the emerging market. We see a revival. You see it and I talkedabout Brazil. But we see it in Asia as well. India, very, very strong for us. That's one of the reasons why we're investing in U.S., sits on the groundthere. It's coming back. Interesting enough, even regions like the Middle East and Africa. Anyway that's good growth. So that's good because that'ssupplementing our growth rate, in particular because we have 50% of our sales in emerging markets already. So that's really, really helpful. Andthat was not helping in the last 2 years. On the consolidation front, in this space you have probably the 4 big players and then a couple of medium-sizeplayers or small players. What we have done is with Ottens, David Michael, for example, Fragrance Resources, we did a rollup strategy of some ofthe smaller assets to get geographic size or, let's say, focus on smaller customers. So that will probably continue. The big move, we discussed it's     9     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

But you mentioned something which is really important. Ibelieve that it is very wise not to look into your super narrow home turf of the F&F business, but to look a little outside as well, as we did with theactive cosmetics, are there areas which are really helping, could help us to grow our market and to grow, let's say, the whole piece of the area wherewe're playing in? And that's something as long as it creates synergies in terms of R&D or in terms of our customer base, because usually they arethe same customers for active cosmetics, it makes a lot of sense. So we're looking at adjacent areas and if the opportunity presents, we are certainlywilling to go forward. On the cost savings side, we see certainly that, in particular, many of the bigger customers are very in the cost savings modestill. I actually believe it is dangerous if you look at the top line they want to produce. And you could say, it's actually good for us because then weare the company which has to deliver the innovation, which hopefully makes the products -- product grow. But it's not always the case. But wedon't see it in many of the midsize customers, which are quite investing in what they are doing. So I would say, again, here, it's a very mixed pictureand we have to figure out with whom are we playing and how we're playing. And another recipe against, let's say, cost pressure on our side iscertainly innovation, which can't be substituted. And as more innovative you are, better is your pricing position as well. And believe me, we certainlydo a lot in terms of putting a lot of pressures on our suppliers as well to make sure that if we get, let's say, some leverage on that side as well. Yes,Lauren."

Oris it becoming an expectation that just they need a broader range of options and you need to provide it at the same cost structure?"
20,64390302,INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS &amp; FRAGRANCES,02/22/2018," 8:00PM, IFF",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Andreas Fibig,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,Chairman and CEO,True,False,"It's a typical answer. It depends. So if you have some of these very premium brands or premium customers, which you see in the Est�e Lauders ofthe world and some of their sub-brands, they are very much willing to pay for this extra because they know that they get a new ingredient, whichis 100% natural and specifically, harvest and they can make also a marketing story out of it. I can tell you that there will be a perfume of FineFragrance, which will be launched end of this year, early next year where we have a plant of rose in India where it makes a huge difference whereyou harvest it in the morning or in the evening. We are harvesting it in the evening because it has much more of an animalic smell because it attractsall the insects for the pollination. So we have customers who want exactly that and they pay a lot of money for it. And we have to figure out whoare these customers? What are these products? And how can we sell this in a best way? Is it going mass market? Probably not. And I give you anexample where it is fitting out right now. Everybody wants to have natural vanilla. But all of you who know a little bit about ingredients, naturalvanilla out of Madagascar was USD 20 per kilogram 3 years, 2.5 years ago. It was $550 last quarter. So it's very clear that many of them can't affordthat. Big staple products can't afford it, and they need more synthetic solution. So sometimes the wish is there, they want to do it. But they can'tafford it. So for us is to figure out who really can afford which product category and what can we offer, whether it's the India plant captured in theevening or do we need something we have to provide to our customers, which is a synthetic solution, which I'm not against because profitabilityof synthetic solution is pretty good as well. So that -- and you know we have 35,000 SKUs. Maybe for all the people who are not so familiar withour industry, almost all of our products are tailor-made for these folk. And that's where we have to find out what fits to whom. Makes sense?"

I would say that's in probablyin the receivables area where we had an increase in overdues -- not at risk of nonpayment. I think on the payables side, it's continuing to stay closeto what's going on in market trends and market benchmarks in terms of our payment terms. We've got to get to a point where we have balancebetween what our customers are paying us and what -- and what we are paying our vendors in terms of days payables or days sales outstanding.     10     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

And if that means we're going to have to bring inventories up in the first half of the year, we're going to dothat. So I think it's going to be -- the improvements will probably be back-ended. I would see -- I expect to see the greatest amount of improvementon the payable side. And then we'll see how things evolve in the second half of the year on inventories."

Just curious if you think about category growth, F&F, at least the big 4 companies in the space,if you go back, I don't know, 3, 4 years ago, were growing well in excess of what the overall category was growing, so clearly taking share. If youback out acquisitions amongst that group, it seems like the rate of growth has slowed. I guess, is that fair that maybe some of that category growth-- but if true for all these -- [seems that way] -- does that mean then that you want to go into more adjacent categories to try to stimulate growthexternally or inorganically, however you want to think about it. And then what categories if you think about enzymes, probiotic, color, et cetera,would be most interesting to go into? You obviously, talked about (inaudible) the ingredients?"
