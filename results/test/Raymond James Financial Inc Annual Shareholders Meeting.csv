We appreciate being heard. Because a majority of the outstandingcapital stock entitled to vote at the meeting are present or in proxy, I declare a quorum and the meeting has been officially convened. Transactingbusinesses -- here to transact the business that comes before it, I'm going to call this annual meeting of the shareholders to order.     So the first item is to introduce our Board of Directors. The first one is always the hardest, a good director, but because of his name, CharlieArentschildt, I got actually a lesson from our corporate securities attorney because he's German, how to say it in German with an accent, but Icouldn't pull it off. So Charlie, could you please stand? We're going to have all the directors stand.

Bo Godbold, Bo didn't need any introduction. He has been here almost as long as Tom. And Tom's successor oncehad told Bo, told him he was going to retire. And for Tom's vocabulary, so the first time he ever had to get a dictionary and look up a word, he didn'tknow what retirement meant. I don't think he still understands the word. Bo, thanks.

John Crish, he is the Lead Engagement Partner, and Julie Barba. Julie just made partner.Congratulations, Julie. You now have liability. I'm signing the report now that you're a partner. The representative of KPMG are here to answer anyquestions during or after the meeting.     So the next area is the proxy review. Now I'll present the proposals included in the proxy for your consideration and then we'll open the floors toquestion -- the floor to questions. While the proxy votes are collected, I will deliver my Chairman's report, and then I'll introduce Jim Bunn, theCo-Head of our Global Equity Capital Market business, at which he's going to speak about that business, and the newest member of our executiveteam. I will take a few questions and then close the polls, and then Tom James, our Chairman Emeritus, will speak about current market environment,industry trends and whatever Tom wants to talk about because he will anyway. So that's one of the great things about Tom, whatever's topical,we'll hear about.     There are 3 agenda items set forth. First is the election of the Board of Directors. The board has been nominated following the 11 board membersto serve on the company's board until the annual meeting of 2019, and until their successors shall be elected. The proxy statement containsinformation on the backgrounds and experience of the board members: Charlie, Shelley, Jeff, Ben, Bo, Gordon, Rod, myself, Bob and Susan. So youshould have enough material to decide whether they're qualified; we believe they are. Second is to approve the in-advisory non-binding vote ofresolution on the company's executive compensation. The shareholders are required by Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer ProtectionAct to be given the opportunity to vote to cast a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation for 2017. And the third item is to ratifyKPMG, LLP as the company's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year 2018. KPMG has served in that capacity since 2001.     Are there any questions or other discussion items regarding the motions proposed? If not, the polls are now open. If you desire a ballot, pleaseraise your hand and one will be delivered to you by the Inspector of Elections. You don't have to vote again if you vote -- if you've already voted,but you can change your vote if you wish. Once you've completed a ballot, please submit it to the Inspector of Elections. Anybody need a ballot?No? Okay.     So I've seen -- you've seen our 2007 (sic) [2017] annual report. I'm going to go make a few remarks. Jim will be next. We'll close the polls and thenTom will speak.     So first, 2017 was a very good year on almost any measure. Our revenue was up 18%, both total revenue and net revenue, over 2016. So it was avery strong revenue year growth, partly by things we did like our recruitment and retaining of advisors, partly because we had a good market thatyear, but we had a very good revenue production. And when you look to the net income line, it was up 20%, about the same as revenue. Andusually you expect positive leverage, but we did have an unusual, hopefully very unusual item, $120 million of legal expenses on a case that year.And some acquisition cost going back to our acquisition of Alex Brown. If we remove those items as an unusual one-time item, we're actually up35% for that year on the bottom line. So the results from a top line and bottom line were very good. And what's really impressive is all 4 majorbusiness units had record revenue and record net income even with the charge. So it was a very, very strong year by all the pieces of RaymondJames.     That translated in earnings per share. With those items in there, still up 19%, which is certainly great growth. I wish I could tell you we couldabsolutely do that every year. We hope to, but it's a very, very strong number. And if you add those items back, our earnings per share as adjustedwere up 33%. So certainly a strong year. Traditionally, with Raymond James, one of the things we pride ourselves is a strong conservative balancesheet with a equity of $5.6 billion, well-capitalized, which I'll talk about in a little bit. And our market cap, our stock price really rose dramatically,and we had an over $12 billion market cap at the end of the fiscal year.     If you look to the 4 major business units, Private Client Group certainly had a strong growth, 5-year compounded growth rate over 12%, and netincome of $373 million was over -- almost a 12%, 11.6% compounded growth rate. And again, the secret of -- a lot of people in the industry talkabout our success in the Private Client Group through our recruiting, but we're mostly proud is our regretted attrition is very low. The secret, I think,for Raymond James is made a great -- make it a great place for advisors to do business by the great support our associates give them. They don'tleave. They tell everybody else about it and we're able to recruit. And again, we've been on a very good growth rate, and you can see that both inthe growth of the advisors on the right, where we added 200 net advisors. Now we have a lot of advisors, a couple of percent a year that get outof the business, retire, ill, some pass away. So you're recruiting to fill that, plus to grow the firm, so the results were outstanding. And certainly, the     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Again, over a 12% growth rate over those 5 years and versus our-- any of our competitors, very, very good result.     Our Capital Markets had a record year, but barely. As you can see, revenue and net income really comprised of 2 pieces. The fixed income markethas been very difficult. Its interest rate has been low, and the yield curve, the difference between 1-year, 10-year and 30-year, not very steep. It'sbeen a difficult environment for our fixed income business. Yet, they continue to generate double-digit margins. So they were down a little bit buthad very good performance relative to the industry. But our Capital Markets, our equity capital markets, had a very good year and a very strongfourth quarter to end that year, especially in the M&A business. And Jim Bunn will talk about that in a little bit.     So our fixed income business tends to be a counter-cyclical business. When equity markets are good, it tends to be down. And as they say, our --as John Carson, our leader in that area says, you don't want us to have a great year because it means rest of the businesses will be down, whichtypically happens. So -- but a good contribution by that business. Our Asset Management continues to grow, and our Asset Management businessis really comprised of 2 pieces: one is the amount -- the money we manage for our advisors through our various platforms; and the other half ismoney we manage for outside people in our funds and our investors. So through Carillon Tower associates, whether it will be Eagle, ClariVest,Cougar, or recently joining, Scout and Reams, after this year end. Again, market appreciation, great flow of assets, great results, as we've had over15% growth in revenue and over a 20% compounded growth in the net income of that division.     And last but not least is Raymond James Bank. Raymond James Bank has become a major part of our earnings stream. A very big revenue year.Now in banking, when interest rates start to move up, the revenue moves up. Doesn't mean your profit always moves up in tandem. It dependson the spread, what you earn on your loans versus what you pay out. But their pretax income also had a very strong year. Again, a 12% 5-yeargrowth rate. On the revenues, a little over 11% growth compounded on net income. The bank assets continue to grow, and more importantly, wethink the quality of the loans are very good in the bank.     The bank continued diversify its loans this year with tax-exempt loans from highly-rated municipalities becoming a bigger part. Our what we callsecurity-based loans, which are loans which are secured by stock for our Private Client Group clients, also become a bigger, bigger part of thebalance sheet. So we've moved from really C&I loans or corporate loans over the last few years to a much more diversified balance sheet acrossreal estate SBA loans, single-family home loans and tax-exempt loans. So we've had very, very good results.     For the first quarter, even though it's past the year-end, just as an update, again, we had very, very good revenue growth as compared to the quartera year earlier. Again, keeping that pace of around a 16% growth, fueled by really 2 big areas: One is the stock market continued to perform and goup through year-end. But the other factor is, as interest rate starting to rise, we get a significant lift in our bottom line from interest rates. So forevery basis point spread we can earn over our cost, it's $4 million of profits. So as rates have been rising, we continue to earn more off that interestspread. And that's become a big driver, which traditionally, up through the financial crisis, was a big part of our earnings. And after the financialcrisis it kind of went away for a while, and it's coming back.     Our net income was down 19% over the year-ago quarter, but that was for really one reason, the tax act. We had to take a $117 million chargeagainst deferred tax assets. So things we'd put on the books before, we had to tax-adjust, and you can read companies had billions of dollars ofthis. We had $117 million, which we'll earn back in the next few quarters. So it's a good thing but a one-time hit. If you took that out, earnings wereactually up 35% over the quarter a year ago. So again, if you really look at it adjusted, a very good quarter. And the same on our earnings per share,down 20% if you don't take into account the one-time adjustment, up 33% if you do.     Our balance sheet continues to be very, very strong. Even with the earnings, the equity only went up a little bit from year-end because of that taxcharge was a charge to equity, but our earnings stream remains very, very strong. Our stock price, again, was up at the end of the year and ourmarket cap was over $13 billion. So it marked our 120th consecutive quarter of profitability for the firm, which is really a record very few firms cantalk about. And even in '09, the worst year in the industry, where most firms lost a lot of money, we had an 8% return on equity. I always point outin March of '09, we barely made a profit but that when I was announced to be Tom's successor. I think it scared everybody. Now when we hit 100consecutive quarters of profitability, I give Tom 100 quarters on stage, and to congratulate him, told him he owed me 1 quarter for every quarterafter. He had it give it back to me. So Tom, it's been 20 quarters. You owe me $5 and I'm not going to forget it. But I also told him I hope he wasaround to get all 100 quarters. I hope I was around to get all 100 quarters.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Just forget the dollar amount. We get into the $90 a share range. The growth versusthe S&P 500, which we're in now, or versus the Financial Services Index, if you look -- go back over the 5-year change, and we do this every quarter,the graphs look very similar. We outperformed the competition. And this is Tom's favorite slide, which is, if you had bought 200 shares of RaymondJames when it went public, you'd have almost $600,000 if you looked at dividend reinvestment, and almost a 17% compounded rate of return.Now I knew Tom in '83. He never told me to buy any shares back then, I wish he had. But very, very successful stock performance of the company.     Return on equity, something we pay attention to, for many years, the firm always looked at trying to earn at least 15% or better as an ROE. Andgiven the industry with no interest rate earnings, we were down double digit but in the lower double digits. Now we outperformed most of ourcompetitors even with the most capital, but we were lower than normal. If you looked at this last quarter with interest rates starting to kick in, yousee we have the potential again to be at that 15% level or above, which is really our target in this environment, is that -- to try to get a 15% returnon shareholders' equity. So with interest rates coming back, hopefully we'll be able to start, longer term, closing back on that goal.     Now we had a lot of success over the last -- throughout our history. And most recently there's a lot of press on us, whether it's a big investmentbanking deal, like Mobileye, our profits, Moody's upgrading us, joining the S&P 500, which is really an honor. To me, the biggest honor this yearwas S&P upgraded us. And our credit rating is the same as Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. And it's really quite a story thata company of this size could really be recognized, and a company here in the financial capital of the world, St. Petersburg, Florida. So it's a testamentto Bob and Tom and Bo and a lot of people, Dick Averitt's in the room, people that really helped build this company, to allow us to get the pointwhere we could achieve those types of successes, and mainly through organic growth.     Now in the last few years, we've had a few acquisitions too. We've been very opportunistic with a number of strategic acquisitions, Morgan Keeganbeing the largest, where we had about $1 billion event where the Morgan Keegan family joined us. It's been great. They've been great for ourbusiness. It's continued to help us spring our fixed income business. Our public finance business went from #24 to #8. We have great financialadvisors, and we've seemed to been able to pick very good strategic acquisitions like 3Macs, which is a 200-year old firm in Montr�al that allowedus to had French and compete in Eastern Canada and the Qu�bec province. Scout and Reams joined us this year. Alex Brown, where we've gottena lot of press, where we've been able to increase our penetration in the Northeast and really show that we are in the ultra-high net worth businessalso. So there's been a lot of success. But as we look at that, we remind ourselves that the average period of time for a company to be in the S&Pgets shorter and shorter and shorter.     Lot of companies succeed, but can't continue to be successful through long periods of time. So it's great to appreciate what we've accomplishedand the work we've done, but we can never forget that we're not automatically allowed in this position. We have to earn it every year. And thefocus has always been first is on our values, people. We have great people that really make this firm work and the focus of our clients. Client-firstfocus, the philosophy I think has kept us out of trouble in times of '09 and it's kept us growing as people and advisors and others joined us becausethey know we truly care about clients. So the core values that have been in this business really, forever, we need to keep the focus. Now we needto evolve as the industry evolves, competition evolves, regulation evolves, but we got to keep focused on who we are and why really people arehere because they know we're here to take care of clients.     With that, we still have a conservative balance sheet, something the analyst community gives us a hard time about. They think we have too muchcapital. We don't. We use capital to do those strategic acquisitions, but we also want to be conservative because there will be another '09 of sometype, maybe not as bad, hopefully, but we know there'll be downturns and we want to have cash. Our cash was only a little over $900 million today,so -- but we keep around $1 billion of cash for liquidity. And our focus is been, as Tom always been is, how do we grow smart? Because we growsmart and profitably, you can invest those profits into people, into technology. If you get good people, good technology, good products, you canimprove your business. That helps fuel growth. If you don't, the opposite happens. If you can't grow and your margins are shrinking, you stopinvesting. Then you start losing people. They don't have opportunities. So we gotta say, how do we grow smartly long term? And it has to be smart.We look at the opportunities we have and the risks. So at our off-site, our Board has asked us to look at a few things. First is to focus on not just thegrowth, but the risk management parts of our business. We've continued to invest a lot in technology and how technology interacts with people.So we need to keep doing that, but they asked us to look at some specific kind of long-term things that are impacting our business. The movementof active to passive or from high-cost funds to low-cost funds has an impact on our profitability. So whether we argue active or passive is good forclients, not for clients, we're not going to get through that. We understand there's a trend. And how does it impact us? And how are we going todeal with it? They also asked us to look at our kind of noncore businesses and services, we have a lot of them, not get rid of businesses, but to say,     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

And they -- are they profitable enough for you to pay attention to? So we're goingto take them through the screen of some 70 kind of products and services on the off-site, and I know our board, we will be very, very challenged.And we're also going to talk about our diversity and inclusion, as we continue to grow and is to make sure this is a safe place for all people to work.And they've asked us to present kind of our diversity and inclusion efforts, where we are, what we need to accomplish? So -- and last but not least,Sunday, we go over succession planning. It's not that everyone is planning to leave, it's that we've done this for years now, and Sunday, and ourboard retreats as we go over every position starting from mine on down and to say who is the successor? Are they ready? Are we training themproperly? Are they going to be ready for the position? Who's going to take their jobs if they move up to the next job? And it's really, really a greatexercise. Because at the end of the day, the success of the firm is by all the great people and leaders. So maybe excluding Tom and I in the top leftthere, we've got a great executive committee. They're very focused, very dedicated, they've driven this business for a long time. Some people likeJeff Trocin, who has been here -- running his business for over 25 years; Dennis Zank, both have been working on their succession plans; Jeff nowco-heading it with Jim Bunn; Dennis really working with Scott and Tash and those changes in developing them. You know really have contributedlong term to the firm. And they want to make sure, not that they're going anywhere now, but they want to make sure that when they do, or whenI leave, or anybody else, the firm's in good hands. So we have a great team of people. Maybe the most -- the nicest accolade we got was actuallyin the Wall Street Journal, you don't expect to get it in the press, and that's Jeff Julien, who was honored as the longest-serving CFO of any Fortune500 or S&P 500 company.     And so the title is, finance chiefs are staying longer in the job, and that's good for companies. And that's because this is the profits over just 30-yeartenure.     So I'm sorry to say, if you think Jeff can retire, he needs another 30 years just to keep this chart going someday. So Jeff, you're -- we're going to keepyou here for a long time. With that, it's a great firm, built on great values, built on great -- built on a solid financial platform. It's an honor to be here.It's -- I hated to be the first James -- non-James to open up the shareholder meeting, right. Yes, I can change my name. So I get in the world toothen.     So thank you all for attending, and I'd like you now to give a warm welcome to Jim Bunn. Jim came with us in the Lane Berry acquisition and hasworked his way through our equity capital markets on the M&A side. He was an outstanding M&A professional, really grew that business, took overand now he's co-head -- co-heading with Jeff. So Jim, come on up and..."
3,64390036,RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL INC.,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, RJF",Raymond James Financial Inc Annual Shareholders Meeting,James E. Bunn,"Raymond James Financial, Inc.",Co,False,True,"My first name is James, so if that -- that's me. I'll take what I can get. I'll also note that when Paul commented on a record year, he caveated by sayingbarely a record year and I would just want to point out that when they study the record books and say, for example, who's the all-time winning asquarterback in Super Bowl victories, Tom Brady would show up. He's barely the leader with 5 over couple of guys with 4. But he's still the #1. Sothe record books don't always denote barely. And for those wondering if I'd work in a Patriots with Tom Brady reference into the presentation andall, there you go. I'm Jim -- go pass. I'm Jim Bunn. I co-head our Global Equity Capital Markets business or as we often refer it to an internally equitiesin Investment Banking. As Paul mentioned, I joined the firm in 2009 through the acquisition of Lane Berry. It was a Boston-based M&A advisoryfirm. It was a, I think by all measures, a tremendous success. Almost all of the senior folks from that firm who were with me as part of the team whenI joined the firm, are all still here and many have assumed leadership positions and found this to be just an absolute fantastic company to work for,and there's been a lot of growth that I'll talk about over the time period. So it's been a pretty exciting period and I was part of the best thing thatcould have happened to our firm was to be acquired by Raymond James coming up on 9 years ago. It's hard to believe it's been that long time,time flies. I will talk about our Capital Markets businesses and in particular our Equities and Investment Banking business, or ECM business. Thatbusiness has shown very strong growth over the last 5 years on the revenue line and even stronger growth on the earnings side. Revenues haveexceeded $1 billion in each of the last 2 years, fiscal '16 and fiscal '17. Both records, both all-time highs. And earnings have grown faster thanrevenues because our margins have been expanding. The margin in our Capital Markets business has reached 13.9%, almost 14% in fiscal '17. Andthat compares to 9.4% back in '12 and 11% in '13. So together with that revenue growth has been some pretty strong expansion in our margins.     If you look at the constituent parts of what makes up our Capital Markets businesses, it's a pretty balanced business overall. ECM represents justover half firm-wide Capital Markets revenues last year. Fixed Income is about 40% and our Tax Credit Funds business is about 7.5%. If you look from'16 to '17, you can see that North American and European ECM revenues grew pretty strongly. That was offset by some declines in our Fixed Income     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

To some extent, the growth rates of those businesses tend to offset each other. Net revenues related to our LatinAmerican joint ventures were lower. We sold our interest in those in early 2017, that affected the overall top line. And the result of all that is, overall,roughly flattish Capital Markets revenues, but with a mix shift towards U.S. and European ECM revenues.     In the U.S. and Europe, ECM revenues reached $464 million in 2017. That was a 27% increase over 2016 and a record revenue level. I'm fortunateto be able to stand here and present the results after such a terrific year. From 2012 to 2017, our ECM revenues have increased at a compoundannual growth rate of over 10%. And the growth in 2017 did follow declines in each of 2015 and 2016. Each of -- our ECM revenues are made upof several different business lines and advisory business and underwriting business, sales and trading business. Each of those businesses have theirown growth profiles and trajectories, opportunities and challenges, and I'm going to detail some of those over the next several slides.     The most significant catalyst for our recent growth in ECM has been the Investment Banking business. Since 2012, those revenues have almostdoubled, that's a CAGR of more than 14%. Revenues grew by almost 50% in 2017, the biggest growth year we've ever experienced. Within theInvestment Banking business, we have a pretty diversified franchise. We've got a presence and a focus across really 9 sectors as we organizeourselves: technology, financial services, healthcare, industrials, real estate, consumer, transportation, and the defense and government servicesbusiness. And our bankers in each one of those 9 industry groups are supported by product group experts in several areas: M&A, public equities,debt, private capital solutions, restructuring, and a team that covers financial sponsors exclusively, which is a really important client constituencyfor us that I'm going to talk a little bit more about later.     The biggest driver of all that growth in Investment Banking has been our M&A and advisory business. Specifically in the U.S, that business almosttripled in size over the last 5 years. It's grown from $80 million in 2012 to almost $230 million in 2017. That's a 23% compound annual growth rate.     M&A and advisory made up more than 75% of our Investment Banking revenue attributed to ECM in 2017, less than 25% came from underwriting.My guess is that's probably a little bit of surprising fact to some of the folks in the room and some of the people who've known Raymond Jamesfor a long time, who probably perceive that our Investment Banking business would be very Capital Markets underwriting driven. But that wouldmask the fact that over the last several years, we built a very strong advisory business with a great reputation and doing bigger and bigger andmore prominent transactions, particularly over the last 5 to 7 years.     That growth has really been the result of a focus on developing and recruiting M&A and advisory-oriented bankers to the firm and then successfullycompleting larger transactions with larger fees, creating productivity gains. The number of transactions that we worked on with a fee of over $1million has grown from 25 such transactions in 2012 to 66 in 2017. And our average M&A fee per completed transaction has grown from $1.2 millionin 2012 to $1.6 million in 2017, and this demonstrated pretty consistent year-to-year growth over that time frame.     We worked on several transactions last year that were notable for a few reasons: one, their size, as multi-hundred million dollar valued transactionslike the sale of ECA compliance, which is a portfolio company of a private equity firm, New Mountain Capital, to Starr Investment Holdings; the saleof the business for global cash card to ADP transaction values which of those don't appear in the slides because they weren't publicly disclosed,but each of those were north of $500 million transactions. They were very large deals. Secondly, a number of these are prominent for their significancewithin the industries in which they occurred. Paul mentioned a Mobileye transaction earlier, that be the single largest transaction we've ever advisedon, period, much less as the sole advisor to the company. That was a $15 billion transaction. Mobileye was a leader in autonomous driving technology.Business was acquired by Intel. Another good example is our work for Roadrunner Transportation Systems, a public company, where we led a $540million recapitalization for that business by Elliott Management. And I see a couple of members of the banking team, who worked on that, actuallyin the audience. Lastly, some of these are notable for our representation of significant public companies in large and important transactions ontheir behalf. Good examples are the sale of Datalink. It's a publicly traded technology company and their sale to Insight; the merger of UnitedInsurance with American Coastal Insurance; and the sale of Sage's Payment Solutions business, Sage being a public software company, to GTCR,which is a very prominent Chicago-based private equity firm. So lot more transactions in these we were proud of but just a few that are kind ofnotable for some of the key things that we focus on.     All that said about our advisory business, our underwriting franchise is very strong too. And importantly, when you -- we look at revenues betweenadvisory and underwriting, it's important to note that only a portion of the ultimate -- the total underwriting fees that we earn at the firm getbooked to Investment Banking, others get booked to private client depending on how the deal was distributed. Our underwriting transaction     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Our revenues in activity tends to follow what's happening in the broader market. We did complete 109 underwritings lastyear. That's up pretty significantly from 2016, which was a very slow year in the IPO and follow-on markets, in particular, for some of our -- historicallyvery strong underwriting sectors like oil and gas and like real estate. But still last year was down from the peak levels that we experienced in 2013to 2015. One area where we have been successful in growing our role is in growing our role on the transactions on which we participate. We werea bookrunner or a lead manager on 52% of our transactions in '16, 47% in '17. That compares to roughly 30% to 40% in the '12, '14 and '15 timeframe. So we've been able to consistently move up the ranks, if you will, and command greater positions and greater economics on our transactions.All that has led to increasing recognition in the industry for Raymond James and our standing in the Investment Banking community. I won't detailall of these awards, but they're bestowed upon us in the investment banker's version of the Oscars which -- there's a few of those that we take placein every year. And we're very proud of a number of the awards we've won, whether it be cross-border deal of the year between $500 million and$1 billion, financial services deal of the year, divestiture of the year. Some of our investment bankers have won -- young and upcoming investmentbankers have won Emerging Professional of the Year type of awards. We've won firm of the year award. So we're really proud of this.     One of the most important initiatives that we've undertaken in the last few years has been the expansion of our Investment Banking business andspecifically our advisory business overseas to Europe and the U.K. A couple of years ago in this meeting, my partner, Jeff Trocin, described ourintent to expand to Europe and the importance of that had on bolstering our cross-border capabilities and continuing our track record of growthand success in winning important M&A mandates.     At that point in time, we were in amidst of a pretty comprehensive review of what are all of our organic and inorganic opportunities to expandinto Europe. And at the end of that, we acquired a Munich, Germany-based business called Mummert & Company that occurred in June of 2016.We have known the Mummert team for quite some period of time. There was some kind of activity between some of our senior professionals andtheir founder, Mel Mummert, and we had the opportunity in late '15 and early '16 to work collaboratively with them on a transaction, German-basedcompany, where we brought domain expertise from our U.S. teams. We had a great experience. We got the transaction done and completed verysuccessfully. We found that we worked very well together, had a similar approach to the business and style and that led us to conclude that theywere the right partner with us. And they -- more importantly, they shared our ambition to build a leading middle market advisory business inEurope. Since that acquisition, which is now about 19 months ago, we've more than doubled the scale of our European Investment Banking business.We've grown MD headcount from 6 at the time of the acquisition to 14 today. We've created an advisory board. 8 senior executives, all CEOs orformer CEOs from the industries in which we operate. Really designed to kind of expand our network and help keeping our industry expertise andour ability to compete and win and get to the right levels within the corporations that we're trying to reach. We opened a Frankfurt office in October.Really, Frankfurt is a closer and more of a financial hub for the private equity firms that brought us closer to the private equity community, and acouple bankers opened there. We have deep domain expertise, and then we followed that shortly by opening our London office. London focusedspecifically on technology. London is really a hub for investment banker engagement decisions for U.K.-based companies and really leverages ourstrength in technology M&A in the U.S. and in Europe. That was a core focus of Mummert. So our European Investment Banking business is focusedon fewer industries than is our business in the United States, and that really reflects the areas where cross-border M&A activity is the highest. Soin Europe, we're focused on technology. That's our largest industry vertical there, consumer, healthcare and industrials.     The tougher part of our overall ECM business for the last 5 years has been the institutional commission side of the business. This was actually thepart of the business that grew the fastest after ECM was formed in 1996. These figures reflect the totality of our global ECM commissions. Themajority of this is U.S. equities, but this also includes Canada, Europe and Latin America. It's been a very challenging environment for the last severalyears. Industry data shows that the total U.S. institutional commission lot has come down 40% roughly from the peak in 2009. That's really becauseof several factors: one, lower volatility, that's changed a little bit recently. But generally speaking, for last several years, lower volatility, which resultsin lower trading volumes.     Two, profitability pressures on the investment management industry as a result of the shift from active to passive management that in turn affectstheir ability to spend on research with sell-side providers, such as ourselves. Three, competitive factors causing a compression in commission rates.And lastly, a pending regulation that's affecting Europe, but it's going to have an impact on this business in the U.S. called MiFID II. And a lot ofinvestment managers started to reduce their research spend in advance with that to start to prepare.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

It's important to note thatthe revenues reflected here do include a portion of our underwriting fees. So when you look at the revenue levels in '13 and '15, those do includethe underwriting -- portion of the underwriting revenues in those years, and those were stronger overall underwriting environment in those years.So on this side of the business, we're carefully monitoring our investments. We're intensely focused on gaining market share at the expense of ourcompetitors. We're committed to a very high-quality team that's positioned to grow our market share with key accounts and really leverages thisbusiness more than any of our others, leverages our world-class equity research product. And that's a great product.     Our research team is very, very highly regarded globally. We have almost 80 senior research analysts that cover 1,300 public companies. That's atop 3 footprint in terms of covered companies by equity research amongst all firms, inclusive of the bulge firms. And as you can note from thesome of the commentary in the awards bestowed upon our research department on the left-hand side of the slide, the industry services andconsultants all rank Raymond James as one of the top research teams in our industry, inclusive of the bulge bracket and global bank competitors.This is particularly true within our market focus, which are growth industries, growth companies and small and mid-cap and the investors whoinvest in those companies.     So I'll wrap up and talk about some of the growth initiatives that we have in place to continue to drive the type of growth we've enjoyed over thelast several years in ECM. In the advisory business, we're intensely focused on improving our core operating metrics. Those metrics being deal andfee sizes and productivity, as we measure by revenue per managing director and revenue per banker. I mentioned that we've grown our MD andbanker headcount in Europe quite a bit since the Mummert acquisition in 2018, and we expect that headcount growth to yield revenue growth inthat business this year and next that will meaningfully benefit us. We're always focused on attracting and retaining and developing advisory-focusedbankers to the firm. And within every one of our industry and product groups, we have identified opportunities to develop or add senior bankersto continue to grow those businesses.     Mandates for private equity firms and their portfolio companies make up about half of our advisory business. And we focus very intensively oncovering those firms whose investment footprint matches up very well with our industry coverage footprint and we invest in size of companiesthat we tend to focus on when we tend to be successful. A new initiative we have underway is the formation of a leverage finance capability that'sparticularly valued by private equity firms that should allow us to deepen our ties and our relationships with the number of our most importantprivate equity firm clients. At the same time, we're very focused on growing our public company advisory practice, as those generally representlarger transactions. To help grow that practice and really reflecting a trend we've noted towards increasing prevalence of investor activism in middlemarket companies and, in particular, within our research footprint, we formed a team a little over 1 year ago, we call the Activism Response &Contested Situations team, or ARCS, to focus on advising public companies that are either under attack or have the potential to be attacked byactivist investors. Right at the shoot in the first half of 2017, Thomson Reuters ranked us as the #2 activism defense advisor globally. So we werethrilled to get such an award so quickly after starting the practice.     And then looking more globally, I've talked about Europe, and we've also completed several transactions between Chinese and Asian buyers andinvestors and companies or our clients in the U.S. and Europe. We expect such activity to grow in volume and importance in the middle market, inparticular, and we're not planning or anticipating putting a big team on the ground in Asia at any point soon. We did add a banker to our Europeanteam, native Chinese, focused on facilitating cross-border deal flow between the U.S. and China, and we expect to add a similar resource in theU.S. in a hope to help us expand that business more broadly across Asia.     In the underwriting business, we expanded into the Life Sciences business in 2015. We're pleased with the progress we've made in the first coupleof years of that practice. The Life Sciences market is very important. It's 15% to 20% of the entire underwriting -- U.S. equity underwriting wallet inmost years. And so we have a lot of opportunity to continue to grow that practice. So we're very focused on expanding our team on both thebanking and the research side of the house to capture a greater share of that enormous market. In other sectors -- underwriting sectors which arereal historical strengths for Raymond James, oil and gas, real estate, financial services, technology, we're continuing to focus on increasing ourshare of the target transaction fees noting that an increase in percentage of the activity within many of those sectors is in the form of large boughtdeal formats, which is generally not actually in our focus because of the: A, generally lower profitability and; b, higher risk associated with thosetransactions. We'll do them selectively but a number of them that we've seen in our footprint have been multi-hundred million dollar deals, whichwe tend not to have the appetite for.     9     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

We're focusing our resources to capitalize on those opportunities. MiFID II will represent a significant headwind this year inEurope, and we expect that to affect our U.S. equities business this year and next as well. We're monitoring that pretty closely and we will respond.One of the things we'll be seeking to do in a post-MiFID world, as we refer to it, is to add new types of differentiated research different from thetraditional industry-oriented research. We recently added, as an example, a Public Policy Analyst to our team, and that analyst has already beenhugely impactful at a number of our largest and most important accounts. So I would expect to see us to continue to look for differentiatedopportunities to grow our research practice and expand our research focus along those lines.     So with that, I'll be happy to take any questions at the end of the meeting, and I will turn the podium over."

Of course, you're a Miami grad. Is that an upgrade? I'm not sure. So we have all these football rivalries. I've been on the losing end of allof them but that's all right. So I will now open up for questions from the audience. Please raise your hand if you have a question about any of theitems on the proxy statement. If you have general questions, we'll also be around after the meeting, you can ask us. But if there are any questionsthat you want to bring before, please raise your hand.     Last chance.

5,64390036,RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL INC.,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, RJF",Raymond James Financial Inc Annual Shareholders Meeting,Thomas Alan James,"Raymond James Financial, Inc.",Chairman Emeritus,False,True,"Thank you, Paul. I'll turn myself on. I think Paul thought since I turned over this chairmanship a year ago that I might have postpartum depressionif I didn't have the chance to get up in front of the group and talk, which I'm prone to do. So I thought I would deal with some subjects that oughtto be of interest to investors as well as employees of the firm that we don't normally talk about. But I did want to make a comment about Jimbecause Jim is a member of the team of people who have joined us, who are a younger management group from a different generation, andcertainly I am, and maybe even Paul in some cases. But I think you can tell that he has excellent capability which, of course, was honed by hisassociation with Jeff Trocin over these 9 years. But he's a terrific M&A banker himself before he managed this effort, and you can see that he has agood grasp of a business that you may not have thought was nearly as important to our firm as it is. I mean, the fact is all of those core groups thatyou saw listed in Paul's presentation were -- are very important to the firm. They all have different interrelationships with each other. But moreimportantly, they serve new complements of clients for us to serve. And our old words are that our business is you, and your financial well-beingapplies not just to individual clients but applies to corporate clients, it applies to institutional clients. You heard about ECM equity clients here. Ifyou heard from our other half in Fixed Income and Public Finance, you would be equally impressed with their ability to operate in a time framethat has been very difficult for Fixed Income because rates are so low. I mean, it's not a very attractive alternative for a lot of people to own whenthe old dictum was you need to be 60% equity and 40% debt. And there are a lot of us who have found other ways on the equity side to replacedebt because it wasn't very attractive to own. And if the current Fed activity is included, we may well find ourselves back in a position with morebalance in sometime in the not too distant future. Although, clearly, the Fed has not been quick to draw the gun to raise rates. They're being verycareful in terms of their lift. So what I would encourage everybody to do. This are big document, somewhat foreboding, I would tell you. This istypical of most annual reports, except that we have a lot more detail than your average public company does. Many companies today give you a10-K, which, to be frank, is so complex, so many pages that you really have to be an analyst to understand it or a CPA to interpret the financialresults. And so what we try to do is tell you what the company is really doing between this shareholders' report and the part of the document thatprecedes the 10-K. And so I want to make a plea to all of you that when you own companies, if you ever talk to those companies, many of them     10     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 230                just send out the 10-K with a one sheet of shareholder report, which you'll find difficult to finding any facts in of value to your assessment of thecompany. And it's -- one of the most important communication vehicles for a corporation to discuss how well it's doing, what it plans to do tomorrow,you heard both Paul and Jim talk about some of these factors going forward, and that's what makes companies different. So I just want to makesure that you've think a little bit about those kinds of things and read the shareholder report because there's a lot of information in there in thatcouple of pages. And you can see in chart form, as you saw on the presentation, a lot of detail. But in this annual report, for example, you can seereports from all of our major departments that enable you to understand some of these segments for business. And it's key, I think, for those ofyou that invest. And I would tell you, one of the things Jim didn't mention about new issue business being done as levels that have dropped off isone of the key causes is that we in the industry for good reason have tried to increase diversification through offerings of packaged products andthere's less focus today on individual stocks. And I would tell you, I regret the complement of having reduced individual stock business becausethat's one of the things that, I think, makes our free enterprise work better. And the fact is that it's fun. If you're an investor and you spend time onindividual securities, don't have to be serious part of your investment at all, could be a small portion of your investment. But you can have a lot offun doing that individual stock investment. And when you do that, the house odds are in your favor unlike Las Vegas. So you can essentially haveyour fun and end that with more cash in your pocket, which is not the normal rule in Las Vegas. Now you will notice here, I tried to stop this. I lovethis photograph, by the way. I've had this photograph for a long time, needless to say, with my father. And all it does is remind me now of how oldI've grown. It's kind of like looking in the mirror in the morning only and in the adverse side when both my father and I were young and had a lotmore energy, a lot -- but it is important, I think, that you recognize what Paul always focuses on when he gives presentations to our employees,not just our shareholders, is that he focuses on core values. And core values are what has remained constant overall these years and a very importantthing. So when you read these documents, there's a lot more to see than just the comparison between the last year and this year's results. As amatter of fact, I would point you in your reading of this document and that first section on Page 22 and 23, there's a 10 year history, maybe thenext -- yes, there it is, you did it for me. That's very nice. I appreciate that. I have a hard time pushing buttons. I even have a hard time closing buttonsin my shirt. It's getting harder, this stuff. Now this is the short form of what you'll find in the annual report. There aren't as many horizontal numbersthat you can trend over this 10 years. This was not the best choice of first year for comparison in 10 years because if you remember, we had thedecline in '08 and a further decline through the first quarter of '09 and we hadn't recovered by the end of the fiscal year for us in September of '09.And so actually, revenues declined during that picture. And yet for that time frame, we had a calculated growth -- a compound rate of growth,average rate of growth during that period at 7.7%, but 9.3% net revenues. So that it was reasonably good growth for corporate America, I wouldtell you. If you look at that S&P 500, they have a hard time with growth at those kinds of rates, and net income match that during the period butonly because of the ramp-up at the end. And I would tell you if you went back to the beginning, you would see that -- Jeff is that for me, no. The..."

7,64390036,RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL INC.,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, RJF",Raymond James Financial Inc Annual Shareholders Meeting,Thomas Alan James,"Raymond James Financial, Inc.",Chairman Emeritus,False,True,"Yes. So -- well, at least, Mary's safe. She's here. The -- so what I would tell you is that if you want that before this time, which probably only Bo andI remember, Jeff remembers some of that, the fact is that we -- and Dennis certainly remembers, that these numbers were faster growth. And partof that is the natural function of growing a little slower when the organization gets bigger because you have a lot more to deal with and it's hardto create new products, if you will, new services, et cetera, at a rate that affect the base as much as you could when the company was new. Andthat's why we're always trying to find new people like Jim that can put a little fire under the growth rate. But any measure here, if you look at it, thenumbers have grown consistently. We always say we're conservative. We actually have a good growth rate and we have probably one of the highestreturns over this time frame over the last 10 over this time frame since we weren't public that he showed you for stock performance. There's thereason that $2,800 grows to $600,000 which was -- were those numbers that we always show you. And that's just for 200 shares of stock which hasbeen a good thing, I would say, personally. But there are reasons why this corporation has done well. And I want to talk about one other, it's veryimportant to those of you that like to buy stocks and that's quality of earnings because earnings are a thing that everybody thinks when you getnumbers, there's only one way to present, nothing could be further from the truth. Actually, when you think about the quality of numbers you lookat, you see today mostly non-GAAP earnings that are reported, which means that there are adjustments made the way we did last year. But in 2017,the one we had was a one-type event. There are always a few of those every year, so it's hard to say you never have and you just don't have thatbig is what I would tell you on that particular adjustment that Paul mentioned. But the rest of the time, we're kind of a GAAP reporter, and we do     11     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 231                that because we're conservative in laying out the numbers. And so it's extremely important, I would tell you, that the numbers you read are reliableand comparable to other companies so that you really know how to make comparisons. And when Jim talked about quality, I personally haverecommended our research staff, they spend a lot more time looking at quality of earnings just to add value to those -- to whom they report becausethese GAAP adjustments, which include things like paying your employees in stock and then adding that back to earnings. I mean, that's realmoney. You're giving them stock but it has a value, and if effectively you have the cash to do it admittedly but you're causing dilution to yourexisting shareholders and nobody wants to talk about that as being a real cost. It is a real cost. And when you see people focus just on EBITDA, thatfamous list of -- which is a way we all track something close to operating earnings, the fact is that you can't really go by just one measurement. Youhave to look at a series of measurements and one just as important that you never see is free cash flow, which, I would tell you, subtracts out yourcapital investment from those earnings to show you how much cash you have you can actually add to the bank account that year to invest in otheractivities. And very important how much cash flow you generate. We happen to had -- we had one small offering back in Morgan Keegan day ofequity and we did some debt and we added debt to the balance sheet. We haven't really grown that equity except by retained the earnings byand large, and we've used that cash to fund all those acquisitions in addition to the organic purchases of new -- of -- I mean, in addition to thepurchases of companies or acquisitions that we add to the company. So it comes from both growing internally and growing by acquisition, whichbecomes harder the bigger you get if you stay in narrow field of business. We're in the financial services business and even if we didn't want to bein the financial services business, the Fed would say to us, you need to be in the financial services business because they don't want anybody thathas to be money-good losing money in other activities. So I think it's important that you understand that from our standpoint because we have alot of regulation by many regulators to ensure that our business is fiscally sound, and we have to have a lot of liquidity. So Paul added just to handleall these transactions every day that we handle. So earnings quality is a very important thing. And when you see these reports by the CNBC headsthat they beat the analyst estimates, do you realize that, that might have been an analyst estimate that was updated 2 weeks early -- earlier andnot the analyst estimate at the beginning of the year for that company's results. It's not really an important comparison. The most importantcomparison for you to look at is historical comparisons, the year-to-year comparison. Sure, you can compare to the prior quarter or prior quarters,but the fact is, if you do that, you've got seasonality and a lot of other factors that enter in -- that make those less reliable indicators of long-termgrowth. So I really think it's hard to believe all this gets to be fun when you talk about this much of detail and confusion that can happen but whenyou're investing serious money, you ought to have a serious interest in what you're investing in. So we believe that we try to help clients make theright decisions in these things but it isn't all easy.     Now I want to talk a little bit about share buybacks because you hear a lot about that on CNBC too. And essentially, it's important in a sense thatbuybacks indicate there's demand for stock, and if you have future demand, there's a more opportunity the stock will go up than if there is nointerest in buying stock. And if the company is adding to the third-party market to buy back stock, there are potential buyers of the stock. The --you can't really look at a corporation and say that you're furthering its mission by buying back stock. I mean, you're in business in a corporationthat's public to make more money for your shareholders through following your chosen business activity and doing it the right way, serving yourclients and earning their business every year going forward. When you're looking to buy companies and part of that activity is some years, therearen't any that you would buy. So you can't feel pressure to do that. You can't feel pressure on this quarterly earnings comparison stuff, especiallyin our industry when the market action has such a large impact on overall results. Our individuals start commission activity was up 2.5x when wehad this recent core action which -- that's fairly a large change from some volatility occurring in the market. So what I would tell you is it's importantthat you take the long-term view, hence, look at those 10-year type numbers, look at 5-year earnings, don't think about just -- and listen to whatpeople say about the plans for going forward. Are those companies that kinds of companies you want to own? It is true that you will increaseearnings per share when you buy stock back because there are less shares to divide by. But let me tell you, if you buy another company at a muchhigher ROE on your investment or even invest in your existing businesses for equipment, for people, for all the things that you have to invest inevery day, as we do in financial advisors, one of our biggest investments is recruiting, the fact is that return, if you retain your people like we do, isterrific. So those are the things you have to think about when you're a board member. And one of the things I wanted to do here is thank theemployees who are in the room, members of the executive committee who aren't directors, and say thank you. Because this year doesn't happenwith 1 year's effort. I can tell you that. It's earned over a long period of time. And they are doing a terrific job and our directors understand ourbusiness. And if you look today at what it takes to be a public company director, it's like night and day from a decade ago, much less when we wentpublic in 1983. So they do a lot of work, and what are we doing? He's talking about this meeting we're going to. It starts tonight and finishes onSunday afternoon. So we're not just doing a board meeting tomorrow morning and partying. We have a lot of work to get done over the next fewdays, and dealing with the subjects that were pointed out to you by Paul is no small task, I can tell you. And that's what makes this company betterbecause our directors take serious interest in this. We hire the kind of people who will debate, criticize, complain, but all with the direction ofimproving the corporate actions, so that we deliver better results. So I really want to thank all of you also who are shareholders. Many of you were     12     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.
