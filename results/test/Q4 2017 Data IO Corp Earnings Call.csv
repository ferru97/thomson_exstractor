Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by commenting on 2017's fourth quarter and full year results, and ouroutlook on the overall market, and then I'll turn it over to our CFO, Joel Hatlen for more detail on the numbers, including some more detail specificson the recent tax law changes and their impact to Data I/O.     2017 fourth quarter highlights include $7.6 million in bookings which represent an 11-year high for us in the fourth quarter. Revenues were $8.1million, another multiyear high for us in the fourth quarter. We had continued strength in our automotive and programming center segments, andalso realized our first revenue from the SentriX security provisioning platform. Once again, our operations delivered a very strong performance,     2     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

We ended the year with $18.5 million in cash. We also received our ISO9001-2015 certification for both our Redmond and China manufacturing locations.     Net income for the quarter was $1.5 million, including the onetime benefit from tax reform, and again, I'll let Joel talk more specifically about thetax benefits later on.     When we look at the full year for 2017, it was one of those years where everything aligned very well for us. We had strong market conditions, theright products and outstanding execution across the company. These results that we enjoyed in 2017 are the result of our multiyear plan and thehard work of all of our Data I/O employees and partners. For the full year, revenues of $34 million were the highest level in 17 years, and thisrepresents our fifth consecutive year of revenue growth. We also had $34 million in bookings, which also represented the highest level in 17 years.     Net income for the year tripled to $5.4 million, and this represents about $0.65 per diluted share, including effects from the recently passed taxlegislation. Automotive bookings for the year were up 46%, and now represent over half of our orders at 54%. Programming centers grew 20% in2017, following a very strong 2016. 24% of our orders went to the programming center market. We also continued our growth in our new products.We've shipped over 180 PSV family automated programming systems through 2017, and our operating model continued to perform exceptionallywell. Our gross margins for the year were 58.5%, growing substantially over the last 4 years.     Switching now to our long-term outlook. When we sat here 2 years ago and discussed results, we reviewed our long-term market forecast, whichat the time showed us looking at a doubling of our available market for Data I/O in 5 years, or about 15% per year compounded from 2016 through2020. We discussed how this was driven by automotive electronics, the Internet of Things and factory automation. I think it's time to update our-- look at that and take a look at our progress on that long-range outlook.     From 2015 to 2017, our revenue increased by about 55%. Our bookings in automotive more than doubled during this time, and our bookings inprogramming centers also more than doubled during this time period. We grew substantially faster than our industry in the past 2 years. And as Imentioned earlier, automotive now represents over half of our revenue and programming centers represent about 1/4 of our revenue. Our long-termthesis about automotive growth is unchanged. As we said before, we're in the midst of new and exciting electronic content, including automotiveinfotainment and instrument cluster applications, Advanced Driver Assist Systems that come and support both autonomous driving and connectedcar strategies from all of the leading automotive OEMs. We plan continued investments in the automotive space in all areas of our business:Programming technology, handling technology, systems integration, factory automation software, global service and support, marketing andsales.     Industry forecast from leading automotive OEMs show about a 10% to 15% compounded annual growth rate for semiconductor content in cars,and a larger increase of about a 30% compounded annual growth rate in the total market for flash memory in cars, growing to about 1 terabyteor more of flash memory in the next 7 to 8 years. Leading-industry flash memory suppliers are also planning to migrate from the current standardcalled eMMC to UFS interfaces in cars. We recently announced our UFS solution for automotive and have already earned our first customer. We'vealso mapped out a multiyear strategy to maintain industry leadership in automotive and keep our customers competitive as their flash demandsharply increases.     The IoT market continues to grow but is lagging today in security solutions. The opportunity for Data I/O is to simplify the security provisioningprocess and make solutions available to customers of all sizes. To simplify security provisioning, we've developed the SentriX security platform.We're investing to lead the industry here in the potential market of nearly 4 billion units in the next 5 years according to ABI Research. We've beenvery successful partnering with the leading silicon suppliers of authentication ICs and secure microcontrollers. As you probably noticed, we'vemade several recent announcements in this area, and expect more in the next week as part of the Embedded World event in Germany. We're alsoworking with leading tools and security software suppliers in this ecosystem to simplify and streamline the security process for IoT devices.     Given the traditionally long lead times for new designs, 2018 will continue to be primarily a market development year for SentriX. We're very pleasedwith the progress made to date, which includes our first deployment and initial revenue generation from this SentriX system.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters.

This is driven by labor costs, reduced component sizeand increasing quality demands worldwide. We're investing in software and systems integration capabilities to accelerate the move to automationand support major global initiatives, such as Industry 4.0 and the China Smart Factory.     For our 2018 growth outlook, we see signs that our largest programming center customers are still absorbing capacity purchase last year and willnot be adding new capacity at the same rate as the past 2 years.     The test industry, which may also provide some useful comparisons, is forecasting a moderation of growth as well in 2018. Furthermore, we sawa return to more seasonal patterns at the end of Q4 and the start of 2018, and our order patterns can be lumpy from time to time. We start the yearwith about $4 million in backlog and we anticipate the systems in backlog will become revenue in 2018. We also expect gross margins this yearwill remain in the mid-to-high 50% range, depending on revenue mix, factory utilization and sales channels.     We expect an increase in our overall spending, primarily in R&D and marketing, to support our automotive and Managed and Secure Programminginitiatives. At the same time, we remain vigilant in looking at ways to reduce our ongoing operating costs. We have kicked off internal programsto reduce material COGS by another $500,000 over the next 2 years, with some of that benefit planned for 2018. We start the year with over $18million in cash and no debt.     As it was discussed on my blog at www.dataio.com, 2018 will be the year of security and the year the UFS starts the transition in automotiveelectronics. We plan to extend our lead in both. I'd like to now turn over the call to Joel Hatlen, to discuss our -- in more detail the numbers. Joel?"
3,64400116,DATA I/O,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, DAIO",Q4 2017 Data I/O Corp Earnings Call,Joel S. Hatlen,Data I/O Corporation,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",False,True,"Thank you, Anthony. Good day, everyone. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $8.1 million as compared with $6.4 million for theperiod last year. As Anthony noted, the 26% year-over-year increase was primarily a result of automotive electronics demands from both OEM andprogramming centers, primarily related to our PSV family of programming systems. Revenues from adapters increased $212,000, or 14% from theyear-earlier period. Total revenue was comprised of capital equipment, 70%; adapters, 22% and software, 8% in the fourth quarter. On a geographicbasis, international revenue represented approximately 92% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with 88% in the fourthquarter of 2016. Revenue growth was the strongest in the Americas, which increased 59% from the prior year. In Europe, revenue grew by 24%year-over-year while Asia experienced a 12% increase. Order bookings were $7.6 million in the fourth quarter, which is an 11-year high for thecompany, and an increase of 4% from the same period of the prior year. The variation in revenue percentages versus order percentages relate tochanges in backlog, deferred revenues and currency translation.     Data I/O had $1.8 million in deferred revenue at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.6 million at the end of the third quarter, andcompared to $1.9 million at the end of the prior year. Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4 million compared to $4.6 million atthe end of the third quarter of 2017, and $3.2 million at prior year end.     For the fourth quarter of 2017, gross margin, as a percentage of sales, was 58.5% compared to 56.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increasewas primarily due to sales volume, which resulted in better fact -- fixed factory cost utilization, along with a favorable product mix, a favorablechannel mix, and reduced unfavorable factory variances. Throughout the year, our manufacturing teams in both Redmond and China continuedto demonstrate operational excellence in execution in a virtually investment-free delivery of increases in capacity during the year.     Operation -- operating expenses were $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $3 million in the same period of 2016. The increasewas due to additional engineering and R&D spending of approximately $356,000 associated primarily with our new security provisioning or SentriXplatform, and other automotive-related technology innovations. R&D increased 25% for the fourth quarter year-over-year, although as a percentageof sales, the expense category was marginally lower. Sales and marketing expenses increased $204,000, or 27% for the fourth quarter year-over-year,which reflects higher sales levels as well as our heightened efforts in promoting our new security provisioning solution. Included in sales andmarketing are variable incentives, sales and commission compensation, along with additional trade show and other marketing activities.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters.

As apercentage of revenues, operating expense categories were lower this year as compared to the prior year period. As compared to the third quarterof 2017, total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined, due in part to revenue level and a return to more normal channel mix,resulting in less commissions and incentive compensation.     In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.5 million, or $0.18 perdiluted share compared with net income of $755,000, or $0.09 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in the fourth quarter of2017 net income is a net benefit of $531,000 from the recent tax reform. Included in nonoperating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was again of $140,000 for sales of non-core internet domain assets. Excluding the Q4 tax reform benefit and the Q4 '16 nonoperating income gain,non-GAAP net income was $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an improvement of $390,000, or 63%, from the non-GAAP net income of $615,000in the fourth quarter of 2016. EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, another non-GAAP measure, was approximately$1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to EBITDA of $962,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016.     Equity compensation expense, a noncash item, in the fourth quarter of 2017 and '16 respectively, was $174,000 and $111,000. Adjusted EBITDA,excluding equity compensation, was approximately $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of2016.     Please see our press release or SEC filings for discussion and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures.     Now let's move on to the discussion of our annual financial performance. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net sales were $34.1 million,increasing $10.7 million or 45% compared with $23.4 million in 2016. International sales were approximately 92% of total revenue in 2017 comparedwith 87.5% of total revenue for 2016. For the entire year of 2017, bookings were $34.3 million compared to $26.9 million in 2016. These increasesare due to the same factors discussed previously for both the fourth quarter and in Anthony's discussion.     Gross margin of $20.1 million, or 58.9% as a percentage of sales for all of 2017 increased from $12.9 million, or 55% in the prior year. Operatingincome for 2017 was $5 million, an increase of approximately $3.6 million or 254% from $1.4 million for all of 2016.     The balance of our income statement and non-GAAP performance measures on a comparative annual basis are included in our press release. Insummary, our expense categories, while up in dollars as a percentage of sales, were each down in 2017 compared with 2016, and our operatingand net profit on a dollar basis tripled.     Now I would like to talk about the tax reform impact for Data I/O. As you know, on December 22 of 2017, the U.S. government signed into law, theTax Cut -- the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which among other things reduced the federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January1, 2018. The impact from tax reform may differ from our estimates due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions orfurther guidance that maybe issued. Our initial assessment is complete, and we recorded a $531,000 net benefit in our fourth quarter of 2017results. This was made up of $67,000 of additional tax relating to the deemed repatriation of previously deferred foreign subsidiary, post-1986earnings and profits and recognizing a tax benefit of $598,000 relating to refundable alternative minimum tax credits and carryforward. We haveapproximately $13 million of U.S. net operating losses in carryforward at December 31, 2017, as well as other credit carryforwards in the UnitedStates that are available to continue to offset our future U.S. net income. And we will continue to analyze and manage taxes to take advantage ofthese tax attributes, particularly amid the recent tax reforms.     On other balance sheet performance matters, receivables of $3.8 million at the end of 2017 were reduced from $5.2 million at the end of the thirdquarter, as well as from $4.7 million at the end of 2016. Day sales outstanding were very good at 45 days, down from 61 days at the end of the thirdquarter. The company's cash position as a result, at December 31, 2017, was $18.5 million, up $7 million from the end of the prior year as comparedwith the $15.2 million at September 30th of 2017. $12.4 million of our cash was in the United States and the balance in foreign subsidiaries.     No actual cash movements took place as part of the tax reform deemed dividend. Working capital was $19.5 million at the end of 2017, animprovement from $18.4 million at the end of the third quarter and $14.6 million at the end of last year. As a reminder, in the first quarter of eachyear, Data I/O typically pays a good portion of its annual public company operating cost as well as satisfying any cash payments from annual     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters.

Everything that I read and see and talk to our customers about indicates that the fundamental long-term trends inautomotive are still present. They need more flash memory across the car. Mercedes-Benz highlighted this at an investor and technology eventlast summer, where they talked about getting to 1 terabyte per car by 2025. I've seen numbers even double that number.

The other piece is we do have fairly hefty amounts of accrued expenses that we're reading into year-end incentives and accrued pensionand things like that.

19,64400116,DATA I/O,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, DAIO",Q4 2017 Data I/O Corp Earnings Call,Anthony Ambrose,Data I/O Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",True,False,"Sure, James. So when you look at it -- just step back so the -- without getting into too much on technology -- the memory market for the technologyis used in a lot of infotainment, navigation systems, things like that in cars that tend to be the big consumers of flash capacity. They've used thetechnology interface, which is called eMMC. It's just the abbreviation for the current technology standard. The new technology standard is calledUFS. And so you're beginning to see new designs look at UFS. And this is not something that happens overnight, nobody snaps their fingers andsuddenly everybody migrates. But UFS has some benefits, especially in terms of overall performance and I'll call it snappiness of the interface. Andso we would expect more automotive customers to be investigating that. We also are in constant discussion with memory companies about whatthey think their marketing mix is going to be. And obviously, they have a pretty good idea of what they're going to sell. So over time, I think you'llsee the migration to UFS. It's very important for us to be out in the market now, because as customers go in their early designs and take monthsto take a design from production -- sorry, early production to pilot production to full production -- we can be there with them the whole step ofthe way or every step of the way with their design process. So we like the technology. We're very happy to have a product. We're very happy tohave earned our first customer in UFS, and we'll be there with the market for both eMMC and UFS solutions in automotive."

Lafferty & Co., Inc., Research Division",Former Research Analyst,True,False,"New products and rollouts, you mentioned that you're still sort of in the market development phase for the SentriX, IoTC -- the IoT secure provisioning.As the IoT marketplace develops that -- the need for security will become apparent fairly quickly and then, as a result, the SentriX's demand will befueled by that. Can you give us a little bit more of an idea of how we should expect SentriX to affect revenue in 2018? Or is that something weshould be looking at for 2019?"
21,64400116,DATA I/O,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, DAIO",Q4 2017 Data I/O Corp Earnings Call,Anthony Ambrose,Data I/O Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",True,False,"That's a good point. The -- so if we look at SentriX, what we're doing is we're giving customers the opportunity to provision the security credentialsinto their products one unit at a time. What that effectively means is that they can take a technology that's very useful today in things like smartcards or cellular phones, and now they can deploy that key and certificate technology into IoT devices. The way that works is each semiconductorcompany lets you put those keys and certificates in, in slightly different ways. So what we've been doing, at first, is to work with the leading suppliersin these markets for authentication ICs and secure microcontrollers to make sure that we support their products. And it's substantially more complexto do that support than it is for a data-only programming support. Given that and given that there is some new products coming out -- and I'dencourage all of you to look and see what comes out of Embedded World next week in the silicone industry -- we're well positioned with thosefirms in the silicon space, but they have to go get design wins and began shipping products to their customers. And the embedded cycles are justanywhere between 6 and 18 months. So that's why my comments earlier reflected that we still think 2018 from a modeling standpoint is stillpredominantly a market development year for SentriX. And you should treat it that way in your models.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Obviously, you have that $500,000 benefit. So from a securityanalyst point of view, you really earned $0.12 in the fourth quarter, backing that out. And I just want to make sure I understand the comparison:The prior year was $0.09, but that had an extra in it of $140,000. So was $0.12 versus $0.08 a reasonable comparison on an operating basis?"

If you're looking at the year, then 2017 actually had $366,000 of those same internet at risk salesthat represented $140,000 in 2016.
