Visteon had a strong fourth quarter that cap off the successful 2017.     On Page 2, let me briefly cover our consolidated fourth quarter and full year results for 2017. The fourth quarter is seasonally one of our strongerquarters. Despite the challenging vehicle production environment in North America, I'm pleased with our overall performance in the quarter acrossseveral key metrics.     2     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $102 million, a quarterly recordfor Visteon, and our 12.8% adjusted EBITDA margin was a 60 basis point improvement compared with the same quarter a year ago. The fourthquarter marked our 12th consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement.     Adjusted free cash flow was $58 million. We won $2.4 billion in new business in the fourth quarter, the most new business Visteon has ever wonin a single quarter. This included significant wins in key product areas, which I will discuss in more depth later.     Our full year results were also noteworthy. Our electronic sales of $3,146,000,000 were an all-time high as was the adjusted EBITDA of $370 million.Our new business wins for the year totaled $7 billion, increasing our backlog to over $19 billion at year-end. I'm very proud of the work of Visteonemployees around the world to generate the strong results and help us finish the year on a strong note.     Moving to Page 3. On this page, I would like to discuss Visteon's sales performance for full year 2017 in light of the market environment. Overall,global vehicle production volumes in 2017 increased just over 2% year-over-year, which was pretty much in line with our expectations. Regionally,the results were mixed, as increases in Asia Pacific and Europe were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in production volumes in NorthAmerica. In South America, the market in Brazil finally leveled off and started recovery in 2017, which helped drive the double-digit growth in theregion.     Visteon's Top 5 customers saw their volumes grow by 1.7%, slightly below market growth. With respect to Visteon sales, volume and new productlaunches drove an increase of $258 million or about 8% over 2016. This was offset by product rolloffs of $138 million or about 4% for an organicgrowth of nearly 4% or twice the growth of the underlying market. The impact of annual pricing negotiations with customers in 2017 was similarto 2016, and combined with the low impact of currency reduced full year sales by $81 million to $3,146,000,000 or growth of 1.3% over the prioryear.     I'm pleased with the overall performance in Visteon sales despite the uneven performance of the market. New product launches are starting tooffset the impact of older products reaching the end of production. And as more of our backlog starts to convert into revenue, this offset will drivehighest sales growth in the future as we have mentioned earlier.     Turning to Page 4. On this page and the next, I will give you an update on the 2 most significant product segments in corporate electronics,instrument clusters and Audio/Infotainment. Both of these segments are undergoing significant transformation and Visteon is right at the forefrontof these industry trends.     Starting with instrument clusters. The industry is quickly transitioning toward digital clusters with growing display sizes that enable dynamicinformation exchange using 2D and 3D graphics. The complexity and software content of this new all-digital clusters are significantly higher thanthe older generation devices they're replacing. The dual requirements of rendering critical safety relevant information such as telltales, combinedwith the need to render digital content, such as maps and media cover art make these all-digital clusters sophisticated computing devices.     In 2017, we saw significant interest from automakers for 10-inch and 12-inch all-digital clusters, with 2D and 3D rendering capabilities. The displaysare continuing to improve, both in terms of size and resolution as well as other graphics capabilities. And we're starting to see demand for integrationof camera-based driver monitoring features in these clusters.     As you can see on the right of the page, we won almost $4 billion in new business in clusters in 2017. This is our second year of exceptionalperformance in this segment, coming on the back of similar performance in 2016. The global cluster market is about $7 billion in annual sales andthese back-to-back years of strong new business wins put us in a great position to improve our global market share in this segment, which currentlystands at 18% in 2017.     A key highlight of our 2017 new business win performance was that over 60% of the wins were for all-digital clusters. This compares with 37% in2016. Not only are we winning more than our fair share of the total cluster market, we're also outperforming everyone in the fastest-growingsegment within instrument clusters -- the all-digital segment. As a result, the average selling price of the cluster business won in 2017 is higher     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Moving to Page 5. On this page, we will discuss our performance in the Audio/Infotainment segment. The audio segment has been in decline forthe past few years with the progression towards more digital and display-based content in the vehicle cockpit. As one of the leading suppliers ofaudio systems for the industry, Visteon was facing significant headwinds in this space. Also, Visteon's market share in embedded infotainment hasbeen small, based on the business that was inherited through the JCI Electronics acquisition. However, the Audio/Infotainment segment in theauto industry is going through its own transformation, which is creating new opportunities for Visteon. Three new developments are changingthe Audio/Infotainment landscape in a significant manner. First, the success of smartphone projection technologies such as CarPlay and AndroidAuto has created a new product category called display audio. Display audio is quickly replacing traditional audio and entry infotainment systemsas the default infotainment system in the cockpit.     Next, the trend of equipping vehicles with connectivity to the Internet has created demand for the embedded infotainment to be a connectedapp platform. The traditional proprietary and closed infotainment solutions from current suppliers are no longer appropriate for the market.     And finally, the trend toward integrated domain controllers has created demand for integrating instrument cluster and infotainment on a singleelectronic control unit or ECU.     Suppliers with strong cluster and infotainment solutions have an inherent advantage in offering these integrated cockpit domain control solutions.Our strategic initiatives in 2016 and 2017 have helped the company gain momentum in the Audio/Infotainment segment. Our acquisition of AllGoSystems in 2016 has strengthened our hand in the display audio segment. The launch of Phoenix in early 2017 added to our capability in embeddedinfotainment by offering a web application platform for mid- to high infotainment. And the SmartCore technology has been the leading solutionfor an integrated domain controller system for the cockpit, offering integrated instrument cluster and infotainment capabilities on a single ECU.     Visteon had a strong performance in audio infotainment in 2017, winning $1.5 billion in new business compared with approximately $700 millionin 2016. All categories: Audio, display audio and embedded infotainment, saw significant growth year-over-year. We won 2 Phoenix infotainmentprograms, with the second win being a software-only sale to upgrade an existing infotainment system for a vehicle manufacturer in Europe. Wealso achieved 2 SmartCore domain controller wins for integrated cluster and infotainment with vehicle manufacturers in Asia. The strong performancein 2017 with new business wins, Visteon is gaining momentum in the Audio/Infotainment segment. The pipeline of new business opportunitiesfor infotainment and SmartCore looks strong and we expect our performance to continue to improve as we go forward.     Moving to Page 6. Visteon had record $7 billion in new business wins in 2017, and this page provides a breakdown of this performance by productand region. It also offers a view into our backlog, which stood at $19.4 billion at the end of 2017, a growth of 18% year-over-year.     Our 2017 performance of $7 billion in new business was up 30% from $5.4 billion in 2016. The main drivers were the outstanding performance inall-digital instrument clusters and Audio/Infotainment that we discussed on the last 2 pages.     As we have mentioned on previous calls, one of our goals is to increase the average size of new business win, which ultimately drives improvedprofitability. In 2017, we increased the average size of a new award by approximately 25%. Our performance in 2017 was also very well distributedfrom a regional viewpoint. All regions were well represented and I was particularly pleased with the improvement in North America, which grew70% year-over-year in terms of new business wins.     As a result of the strong performance in 2017, our backlog at the end of the year was up 18% year-over-year, reaching $19.4 billion at year-end. Itshould be noted that a significant portion of the backlog is made up of products that are growing faster than the market and is also oriented moretowards regions that are growing faster in terms of vehicle production and sales.     Now turning to Page 7. In addition to delivering on our financial commitments, we are also focused on ensuring the continued success of thecompany as the industry goes through its transformation. On this page and next, I would like to share our thoughts on the key trends impactingthe industry as we look ahead at 2018 and beyond.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 85                As we have discussed previously, the cockpit electronics segment is going through a significant transformation. Many of the trends, such asdigitalization of the cockpit, connected car and ECU consolidation that are shown on the top of this page are already well underway. Visteon hasdone well in taking advantage of these trends in the past couple of years, and the strategic actions we have taken in these areas will continue toposition the company well going forward.     In parallel, the evolution of ADAS towards autonomous driving has been making significant progress and the industry is now looking at offeringLevel 3 automation, with features such as highway pilot and remote self-parking. In addition to the autonomous driving technology itself, Level 3automation requires careful transition of the control of the vehicle between the human driver and the autonomous driving system. This is leadingto our conversions between cockpit electronics and autonomous driving technologies. As the leader in cockpit electronics technologies, and withthe launch of our autonomous driving platform earlier this year, Visteon is in a unique position to address these new requirements.     Going forward, we expect cockpit electronics to require new innovations in human-machine interface to facilitate the evolution of autonomousdriving. These new cockpit solutions, together with the emerging Level 3-plus autonomous driving solutions is offering Visteon further opportunityto grow our business.     Now moving to Page 8. On this page, I would like to discuss the emerging innovations in cockpit electronics that we stressed upon on the previouspage. The last significant change to occur in cockpit electronics human-machine interface was driven by the introduction of infotainment technologyin the cockpit. This required the industry to move beyond hard buttons and knobs to touch screens, speech recognition and haptic controllers.Now there is another transformation of the cockpit electronics underway, driven by the emergence of autonomous driving. This time, the changesare driven by the need to keep the driver informed about the state of the external environment even while the vehicle is being controlled by thesystem, and to hand over the control of the vehicle to the human driver in a timely manner, as required.     This is driving (technical difficulty) cockpit capabilities, such as virtual reality, digital instrument clusters, driver monitoring solutions and augmentedreality [head of] displays. These innovations are expected to be launched in the market by 2021, coinciding with the broader launch of Level 3autonomous solutions. At Visteon, we are developing these new capabilities in our cluster and autonomous driving technology platforms, shownon the right of the page.     At CES earlier this year, we demonstrated our next generation cluster solution that integrated driver monitoring capability. We also launchedDriveCore, our autonomous driving platform, which provides us with an entry point in the very important area of technology for automotive forthe future. As the industry moves towards autonomous driving, these cockpit electronics and autonomous driving technologies will becomeincreasingly important in winning future business. I'm pleased that we were able to make significant progress in 2017 in evolving our technologyplatforms to stay current with the market.     Moving to Page 9. On Page 9, we summarize our highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. For the fourth quarter, we delivered a strongquarter, with $797 million in sales and a record $102 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing 12.8% of sales. We delivered our 12th straight quarterof year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin growth, and we were awarded a record $2.4 billion in new business wins.     For the full year, we achieved sales of $3,146,000,000, which was up approximately 4% year-over-year considering volume and mix. Our adjustedEBITDA margin increased to 11.8%, 70 basis points higher than prior year. We won a record $7 billion in new business, increasing our order backlogto a record $19.4 billion. We continued to perform exceptionally well in the instrument clusters segment, winning almost $4 billion in new business,and we gained momentum in Audio/Infotainment segment, winning $1.5 billion in new business or more than twice the amount last year. Ourdomestic sales in China continued to perform very well, and were up by 21% driven by new product launches, and we exited the year with strongtechnology platforms that are very well-positioned to address the key trends in the industry.     Overall, it was a solid fourth quarter and full year for Visteon. I'm pleased with how the entire team at Visteon continues to be focused on executionand operational excellence, which has delivered excellent financial results, and ultimately, value for our shareholders.     That concludes my overview comments, and now Christian will walk you through our financial results for the quarter and full year.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

2,64388276,"VISTEON, CORP",02/22/2018," 2:00PM, VC",Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call,Christian A. Garcia,Visteon Corporation,Executive VP & CFO,False,True,"Thank you, Sachin, and good morning, everyone. On Page 11, we present our key financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 versusthe comparable periods in 2016. The financials on this page reflect our ongoing Electronics Product Group and exclude discontinued and otheroperations.     As explained on prior calls, our financial results in the prior year included businesses that were exited at the end of last year and were classifiedeither in the Other Product Group or discontinued operations. We did not have nor expect to have any sales or adjusted EBITDA related to ourOther Product Group or discontinued operations.     Electronic sales of $797 million in the fourth quarter were down by less than 1% from prior year, as a drop in North America production volumeswas offset by growth in other regions. Despite the modest decline in revenues, adjusted EBITDA for electronics was $102 million, representing a4% increase from fourth quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 12.8%, 60 basis points higher than prior year levels and largely reflectsoperating efficiencies across our organization. Since 2015, we've had 12 consecutive year-over-year quarterly improvements on this metric.     Adjusted free cash flow for electronics was $58 million in the quarter, $21 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year due to timing of workingcapital payments and higher capital expenditures. I will provide more detail on the full year figures on the following pages.     On Page 12, we provide electronic sales and adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 versus 2016. Electronic sales for the full year were $3,146,000,000or 1.3% higher than 2016 as higher volumes offset the impact of pricing. Overall, volumes and mix were up by 4% compared to global productionvolume growth of 2%. As we have indicated during the course of 2017, we continued to generate strong revenues from China. For the full year,our China domestic sales increased by 21%, while China vehicle production volumes grew 2%. We've seen a decoupling of our sales growth fromthe market driven by our new product launches, and we expect China domestic sales to continue to grow at double-digit rate in 2018.     Our adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $370 million, which if you recall, is at the top end of our guidance. This represents growth of 7% from 2016 andreflects our continued ability to generate favorable cost performance in engineering, material and manufacturing costs. This cost performance,together with the flow-through of new business more than offset the impact of pricing and unfavorable currency.     Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.8% for the year and represents an improvement of 70 basis points compared with 2016. Incremental margins,which are the amount of adjusted EBITDA generated for every dollar of increase in sales were over 60%, which indicates our ability to extractoperational efficiencies, while at the same time invest in new technologies and execute on the new programs we have won.     Turning to Page 13. Page 13 provides our cash flow. Total adjusted free cash flow for the year was $148 million, lower than prior year driven by thetiming of working capital payments, which will in turn benefit our cash flow in the first quarter of 2018. In fact, our adjusted free cash flow forJanuary, 2018, is one of the highest in many years and should dampen the cash outflow we typically experienced in the first quarters of every year.Capital expenditures came in at a little over 3% of revenues for the full year due to 2 reasons: plant investments to cover our strong new businesswin rate; and the higher capitalization of software development costs as we move toward more platform and software-based technologies.     Our returns on invested capital are high, over 19% in 2017, and as such, the best use of our cash is investing in ourselves. Going forward, we estimatethat our capital expenditures will be around 3% of revenues. Free cash flow for total Visteon for the year was $118 million, which is a goodimprovement from 2016 levels of $45 million, as we have completed separation of our legacy businesses.     Cash and short-term investments at the end of the year were $709 million, and that was $393 million, which continues to put us in a net cashposition and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.1x. We have a strong capital structure that would enable us to compete effectively and invest in different[shading] technologies while returning capital to our shareholders.     Moving to Page 14. I'd like to provide an update on our capital return activities. We have authorization from our board to repurchase a total of $900million in 2 tranches, $400 million authorized in 2017 and $500 million authorized in 2018. For the 2017 buyback program, we have repurchased$200 million in 2017, at an average price of $101 million for approximately 2 million shares. We will be entering into a combination of open market     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

In January of 2018, our board has supplemented the 2017 authorizationwith an additional $500 million to be executed through 2020. As such, as of the end of 2017, we have $700 million of outstanding share repurchases.This underscores the confidence we have in our long-term growth prospects and shows our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders.Shareholder distributions will continue to be part of our capital allocation approach going forward, and as the company continues to generatecash, we expect that there will be more opportunities to further return capital to our investors.     And finally, last month at the Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry conference, we discussed how we are leveraging our technology leadershipposition in cockpit electronics, as the industry transitions into autonomous driving. In that conference, we provided our 2018 guidance, which weare reaffirming today. We're also reiterating our investment themes. First, our strong new business wins of $7 billion, with the significant awardswe had in infotainment and all-digital clusters give us increased confidence in meeting our overall long-term growth objective. Second, in 2017,we delivered increased margins of 11.8% while investing in new technologies and executing on our program wins, and we continue to generateadjusted free cash flow.     And third, we continue to be good stewards of capital. We have executed on $200 million share repurchases in 2017, and we have $700 millionremaining that we will execute between now and 2020.     Thank you, and let's open it up for questions."

Brinkman,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",Senior Equity Research Analyst,True,False,"And the question is about the bookings number, was extremely strong in the fourth quarter, to the layman, it would appear that you're well ontrack to exceed the 2017 and 2018 sort of combined $12 billion number. Is that the way we should look at it? Or does it relate somehow to a differentcadence, some wins you thought that might land in the first quarter of '18, and in fact, fell in the fourth quarter of '17? And what does this implyfor your sort of, I think, it's [8.7%] sort of organic CAGR through 2021, et cetera? Are you potentially now in a position to be maybe ahead of plan?"
5,64388276,"VISTEON, CORP",02/22/2018," 2:00PM, VC",Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call,Sachin S. Lawande,Visteon Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",True,False,"Ryan, first of all, yes, we are very happy with our record setting performance in 2017 with respect to new business wins. What I would say withrespect to our longer-term revenue target is that, this performance increases our confidence, first of all, in achieving that target with the wins thatwe've had in 2017 now, I would say, over more than 60% of the 2021 target of $4.7 billion in revenue is already in our backlog or already sourced.So the way we should think of it is that our confidence in delivering our 2021 revenue target is now significantly higher. Having said that, ourrevenue outlook depends on a few other things, such as vehicle production forecasts as well as currency. So our target for 2018 for new businesswins remains the same, roughly about $6 billion. The sales pipeline looks very strong, so we expect to have another strong year. And as we alwaysdo, we will update our outlook for 2021 at the end of the year and then provide you with an update at the next Deutsche Bank conference. Butoverall, again, a very strong year. We feel good about our prospects in the 2020, 2021 timeframe, as we have said earlier in this year as well. And Ithink it also positions us well in terms of being able to deliver a strong 2018."

Do you prefer to produce the associated hardware also? Or are you more attracted to a software ordesign approach because of the positive implications to margin and presumably return on invested capital?"
7,64388276,"VISTEON, CORP",02/22/2018," 2:00PM, VC",Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call,Sachin S. Lawande,Visteon Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",True,False,"Yes. Let me talk first about this win and then I'll also invite Christian to talk about the margin. So if you look at the sales cycle for a typical conquestinfotainment win, it's usually more than a year. And so we are very happy to have 2 wins in Phoenix within a year of the launch of the platform. Sothis second win is for an European OEM, and this is for their existing infotainment systems that they wanted to upgrade to be able to host webapps in a downloadable fashion. So we are providing the Phoenix runtime and the studio developer software to enable the OEM and the thirdparties to create downloadable apps for this infotainment system. This is a software-only sale, and as such, the business model relies on a royaltythat we collect on a per unit basis. And since this is an existing infotainment system, the initial start of production is actually Q3 of this year. So it-- I would say, it's a great validation of our software oriented approach to our platforms. It represents an acceleration of revenue and as a software-onlybusiness, the margins are what you'd expect from a software business. Christian, would you like to add something?"

Garcia,Visteon Corporation,Executive VP & CFO,True,False,"Yes, the only thing I would add, Ryan, is that when you think about the software only, it actually provides us the ability to experiment with variousrevenue models, which we did not have without having this platform-based technology like Phoenix. It is also interesting to note that the hardwareis based on somebody else's as a competitor's hardware. So it actually gives us the ability to port our technology on somebody else's platform, sowhich is kind of really interesting."

It really is achoice that we don't get to make in most of those cases. This is the OEM in most cases that decides that. We do expect a few other opportunitiesin this way where on account of the installed base of infotainment systems that lack the ability to offer an app environment, there is a demand forthe kind of software that we offer with Phoenix. But in the vast majority of the cases, we expect that the OEMs will want a complete system hardwarealong with the software pre-integrated like what we typically would do in normal business."

And I guess, the question is, as you move more and more towards software-based enterprise,should we think about CapEx running higher than the 3% of sales that it's typically run at? And I guess is there a corresponding offset to R&D?"

So in terms of the CapEx, just to give you the magnitude of the increase that we have, we had about $25 million increase inCapEx year-on-year. But 2/3 are what you would consider normal CapEx, which is the plant equipment and so forth that we needed to support thenew program wins that we're having. And 1/3 of that is also -- 1/3 of the increase is the software development costs that you talked about. So goingforward, yes, the software development cost is actually helpful in our R&D, but as you recall, when we guided in Deutsche Bank of what happensin 2018, we have -- our engineering expense is expected to increase because of the incremental investments that we have in autonomous driving.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

And so, I would have thought from an ASP perspective, those 2 might actually offset, but you're still sayingthat ASPs are up 10%. So I guess, within embedded infotainment, are those ASPs higher as well year-over-year?"

So what is really happening here is that the display audio is significantlyhigher than the audio that it is replacing, and that is what is helping the average ASP go up by about 10% for us -- for the full amount. The way tothink of it is, as you mentioned, we are winning in all of the 3 segments. This is a turnaround year, 2017 was a turnaround year for us in infotainment,and it's really driven on account -- by the fact that we have made some investments in our platforms and then we talked about Phoenix, it scalesreally well from entry infotainment all the way to mid-high and the strength that we have on account of the acquisition of AllGo in our -- thesmartphone projection capabilities, which are very important, not just for display audio segment, but also for embedded."

27,64388276,"VISTEON, CORP",02/22/2018," 2:00PM, VC",Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call,Sachin S. Lawande,Visteon Corporation,"President, CEO & Director",True,False,"Yes, so Joe, first thing I would mention here is that one of the key capabilities in our a all-digital cluster, there are 2 in fact, one is the display, theother is the software. And when it comes to the digital display, Visteon has always had a very strong capability in automotive digital displays. Weship over $400 million worth of digital displays every year. So we have a strong capability in taking LCD panels and then treating them and bondingand fabricating the automotive displays that have to withstand the conditions within the car and meet critical requirements. This is not somethingthat most players in the space have, as a vertically integrated capability. So that's one element of that. The other is the software. And then, so whathas happened here with software is that besides having the key capabilities in terms of the technology, we, at Visteon, have critical mass in termsof supporting the specific vehicle architectures of a wide number of automakers in the world. So we have now a broad-based platform that we cantake to automakers that more than likely supports their requirements out of the box. That's different from, say with many other of our competitors,that reduces the risk to the program, reduces our cost in developing that cluster, and this is one of the main reasons why we have won as muchbusiness as we've won. This is the second year that -- in a row that we have won about $3.8 billion, $3.9 billion in clusters and when you look at themarket, which is on an annual basis, somewhere around $7 billion, it represents a significant market share. So we do expect, however, that as wego forward, more of the automakers to transition towards all-digital. And again, momentum is a very good thing, and this should put us in a goodshape to win more of the business going forward in all-digital clusters.     10     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Can you talk tothe potential for additional SmartCore new business wins in 2018 beyond? And really it's just -- has the bid presence dramatically increased?

So you are absolutely right that this move towards all-digital clusters really drives demand for increased computing resources, includingprocessors, memory and software. And the need is really driven by the sort of the drive towards rendering digital content in the clusters andinformation that comes typically from an infotainment system. As we see more of these types of solutions, that is also a big sort of a driver behindthe integration of infotainment and the cluster because it's a lot more effective to have those 2 systems run off of a single electronic control unitor ECU to be able to share that information seamlessly between the 2 displays. Now as we have, I think, in my prepared script mentioned that themomentum in cockpit domain controllers is also picking up, and the pipeline of new opportunities for 2018 is very robust. In fact, it has never beengreater. So we are very optimistic about having more success with SmartCore that integrates infotainment and cluster on the single ECU as we goforward here in 2018 and beyond."

The impact of pricingin any quarter is dependent on the negotiations that we have, with individual OEMs and the programs that they relate to. So as such, there couldbe a lot of unevenness between quarters. Now having said that, if you look at the entire year, the impact was $86 million or a little bit above 2.5%of revenues, which is in line with our historical rate. So I think we should just look at that in that fashion."

And then let me try to describe to you the way we see the opportunities in autonomous. So if you look at theindustry and some of the things that you're hearing in media, there are really 2 sort of directions that the industry is taking. On one side, there isthis push towards fully autonomous, perhaps in more limited domains intended for application such as robot access and for freight movers intrucks that have a point-to-point limited by sort of a specific geofenced area. So that's one initiative. The other initiative is targeted more towardsconsumer car owners. And in this area, the goal is to upgrade the current Level 1, Level 2 ADAS capabilities into Level 3, more automated driving.So at Visteon, we are really focused on working with our traditional long-term customers in enabling and upgrading Level 1, Level 2 into Level 3.Now the key features there that we expect to be of initial interest would be highway pilot and remote self-parking. So what we are doing now iswe're very focused on developing a very cost-effective solution based on DriveCore that meets the requirements of highway pilot and self-driving.And so this is where we would expect as we go -- as we make more progress in releasing these capabilities and launching these features, we'dexpect to see more business opportunities with OEMs that we have started engagement in. The interest is extremely high. We are just as cautiousin terms of who we work with and who are the right partners for us as much as anything. Because again, there's a lot of activity in this industry inthis regard, at the same time, resources are limited. So we are carefully sorting through the opportunities and making sure that we are partnering     12     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

If you think about the margin progression,from where we are to the 14% target that we've communicated, the fixed cost leverage will happen towards the back end of that as we get -- aswe translate or generate the revenues from our backlog. And so that would come in later. The other one is the shift to lower software andplatform-based offerings. It's still quite nascent.

So yes, as I said, that the cycle of, the sale cycle I should say for infotainment is usually more than a year. So now, you wouldexpect that we would start to see a pickup in activity with respect to infotainment new business activity and new business wins. The same forSmartCore. SmartCore has seen a sort of continuous increase in momentum with automakers and the pipeline in both infotainment and SmartCorelooks pretty strong. So I would expect that we would see a pickup in new business activity for those 2 products. With respect to DriveCore, again,it's relatively new for us and for the industry. So there's a lot of discussions that need to happen and business models that need to evolve. So Iwould say that, that is still in a prebusiness-development phase. I would expect more sort of a pick up to offer perhaps later in the year or earlynext."
