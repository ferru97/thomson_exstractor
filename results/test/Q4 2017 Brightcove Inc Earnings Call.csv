2,64390012,BRIGHTCOVE INC,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, BCOV",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Acting CEO, President & COO",False,True,"Thank you, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I am excited to report that we delivered a strong finish to 2017. Our fourth quarterfinancial results exceeded our expectations. We have made significant progress on our strategic priorities, and we are well positioned to deliverimproved growth in 2018 and to exit the year at a double-digit year-over-year revenue growth rate.     Taking a quick look at our strong fourth quarter financial results. We delivered fourth quarter revenue of $40.1 million, which exceeded the highend of our guidance range. We delivered positive adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 million, which was well above our guidance range even after adjustingfor some onetime benefits in the quarter, which Kevin will detail later. We generated $4.2 million of positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter.     We signed exciting new logo up-sell and renewal agreements with such notable brands and content providers as Adobe, AMC Entertainment,Burberry, Discover, Franklin Templeton Investments, Hudson's Bay, Hugo Boss, Le Figaro, McKesson, Schlumberger, Sky NewsAustralia, StarwoodHotels, Subway, Trinity Mirror and Yahoo Japan Corporation, among others.     From a bookings perspective, overall, we had a very good fourth quarter, and I am pleased with how our sales organization performed. For theyear, we achieved double-digit annual bookings growth. Although this fell modestly short of the mid- to high-teens ACV bookings growth targetthat we had set at the start of the year, I'm very pleased with the sales team's performance and what we achieved during the year and in the fourthquarter especially.     We would have been within our targeted range if we had closed the 7-figure deal, which we received a verbal commitment from the customer,but is taking longer to get through their deal execution process than expected. In addition, during the year, we made an intentional choice toincent our sales team to sign multiyear deals. This incentive is working. We signed 59 multiyear deals in the fourth quarter alone. By doing so, wehave increased our strategic importance with these customers, we are able to better plan and align on product road map, ensure healthier accountmanagement relationships and lock in multiple years of committed revenue, reducing annual renewal risk and reducing or eliminating, altogether,market and competitive risk until the final year of the contract.     Many of our deals also include price escalators in the subsequent committed years of these contracts. We also saw, in Q4, increasing new opportunitiesacross geographies in use cases. And when we look at the state and quality of our pipeline and the productivity of our recent sales hires, we're veryencouraged by what we see.     Retention rate is also a significant driver of future revenue growth, and we expect that it will become a tailwind in the second half of the comingyear as we lap the impact of the commodity pricing reset in our media business. As Kevin will describe, we remain on track with the guidance we'veprovided for the timing and impact of our media pricing reset and its impact on retention rates. All-in-all, we are confident that our sales momentumand improving retention will drive consistent double-digit revenue growth over time.     We entered 2018 with strong market momentum, the best product portfolio in the history of the company and a better organized, better managedand more effective sales and marketing organization. I am pleased with how the team is performing. And I believe, we will do even better in 2018.I would like to share some additional specific reasons why I'm so optimistic about the business.     First, in the media market, we have reached a critical referenceable mass of large OTT and SVOD offerings. You've heard us talk about a number ofsignificant rollouts in Japan and Asia-Pacific during 2017. These deployments are going very well. Several of these customers have already increasedsubstantially their investment with us to expand their offerings. And as we head into 2018, they are looking to spend even more with us.     We are seeing that success begets success in this market. And we are focused in 2018 on leveraging what we've done in Japan and Asia-Pacificaround the world. These efforts will include the best practices that we've learned in utilizing our professional services team and industry expertsto engage with customers early in the process in their OTT plan design. Combining this approach with our market-leading and scalable platformofferings, provides a highly differentiated go-to-market model. We see a rapidly growing pipeline of OTT and SVOD opportunities, and we feelgood about our ability to win these customers.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

As I discussed on our last earnings call, we've completed a thoroughreview of our entire sales team, which has led to improved and better aligned processes across the company as well as changes to existing personneland the hiring of new reps. This continues to be an ongoing process, but I believe we entered 2018 with a much stronger, better aligned, moreproductive sales organization that is clear on how we want to go to market and how we differentiate ourselves. Let me share a couple of thehighlights about our revitalized sales organizations.     In Q4, as we told you before, we relocated our Head of Sales from the Asia region to run the North American media sales team. Although we arein early days with this change, so far this transition has gone very well. His first priorities had been to revamp how we identify and source prospectivecustomers and develop opportunities with existing customers and to ensure that we are going to market with the more strategic consultativesolution-based approach. We know this methodology works. And we are seeing positive early signs in this important market. He has also revampedthe structure and certain personnel within the team. And we are very pleased with the moves he has made. The very strong Asia sales organizationthat he had left behind has not missed a beat.     Our North American digital marketing and enterprise sales organization is hitting its stride and, in particular, had significant success in the fourthquarter in growing the new logo side of the business. We are becoming more efficient in managing leads and converting them into sales. We havebetter marketing attribution analysis, stronger insight into our sales funnel and a more tenured and stronger sales organization there as well. OurEMEA sales organization also performed well in the fourth quarter, and we are now seeing dividends from the organizational moves that we madeduring 2016 and 2017.     A third reason that I'm very confident heading into 2018 is that the new product innovation that we introduced in 2017 and the features andfunctionality scheduled to be delivered in the first half of 2018 have received very positive feedback from customers. We are seeing exciting andpositive trends in the market as customers increasingly look to leverage video to drive new revenue opportunities and enhance customer andemployee experiences. This is a sweet spot for Brightcove as our expanded product portfolio positions us well to take advantage of these markettrends and increase the strategic value we deliver for customers every day.     For example, our new Enterprise Video Suite brings together a collection of internal communication tools that enterprises can use to engage, totrain and to interact with their employees. As Millennials become a growing part of the workforce, enterprises need new tools that resonate andengage with this demographic. And as we all see every day, that is taking the form of video.     With Brightcove EVS, enterprises can easily deploy video in a secure and efficient way as a core part of employee training, onboarding, compliancetesting, group meetings and other forms of communication. We're seeing strong customer demand for Brightcove EVS, which represents ourbiggest push to date in the internal enterprise communications market.     A great example of the opportunity for Brightcove EVS is our win this quarter with Subway, the world's second-largest fast-food restaurant. Subwaychose Brightcove's Enterprise Video Suite to deploy internal training to reinforce brand standards and to improve their internal communicationsfor their employees and franchise owners around the world. Subway chose Brightcove after a competitive sales process. We were successful dueto the power and scalability of our platform, our reputation in the marketplace and our high-quality integration with Sitecore.     As another example of demand for our expanding product portfolio, our new Live offering is also seeing very significant customer interest, whichwe expect will only grow with an updated release of that product scheduled for the first half of 2018. Compelling live content is proving to be oneof the most effective ways to engage consumers and to attract attention in an increasingly crowded and diverse entertainment market. Customersare looking for solutions that are easy to use, highly scalable, reliable and cost-effective. These are the core tenants of Brightcove's Live offering.     Yahoo Japan Corporation is a great example of a long-standing Brightcove customer, which, in Q4, substantially grew its relationship with Brightcoveby choosing Brightcove Live for its high-scale news programming and for other live content to be displayed on Yahoo! News.     An exciting industry recognition of our product leadership and success in the video market is Brightcove's inclusion just this past week in FastCompany's list of the Top 10 Most Innovative Companies in video for 2018. This is a tribute to our whole team, of which I'm very proud, and is alsoa testament to our heritage as an innovation and productive-driven company. Innovation is and has always been at the core of our DNA.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 21                A fourth reason why I am confident heading into 2018 is that, as excited as I am about our successes in the field and in continuing to developmarket-leading products, I am equally pleased with the commitment that I've seen across the company in ensuring that we execute and operateefficiently and profitably. We've instilled across the company a more rigorous process to identify and to decide upon investment opportunities.     As demonstrated by our fourth quarter results and indeed by our second half results, we are laser-focused on achieving the financial targets thatwe set for ourselves and for our investors. As Kevin will review later, we will return to full year adjusted EBITDA profitability and to positive freecash flow in 2018, which is an important first step. We will continue our focus in this regard throughout the year. We've already commenced adetailed review of our cost structure to seek opportunities to drive future margin expansion, including, but not limited to, looking at ways to driveincreased efficiencies from our infrastructure as we grow. Our senior executives from our product, engineering and finance organizations are alldeeply involved in this process.     We will also continue to look for ways to drive efficiencies across our operating expense structure in our organization so that we can increaseoperating leverage, while still driving accelerating product innovation and improved sales growth. I want to be clear that, along with acceleratinggrowth, enhancing our margin profile is a top strategic priority for the company.     In summary, Brightcove ended 2017 with strong financial and operating results. We believe we have positioned the company for accelerating topline growth and profitability in 2018 and beyond. We are committed to executing on our strategy for the year and for delivering value for ourcustomers and shareholders. We are confident that our investments in our products and go-to-market teams will enable Brightcove to build uponour market leadership position.     With that, let me turn the call over to Kevin to walk you through the numbers. Kevin?"
3,64390012,BRIGHTCOVE INC,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, BCOV",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Kevin Rhodes,Brightcove Inc.,CFO,False,True,"Thank you, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. As Andy mentioned, we delivered a strong close to 2017, and we are setting up well for 2018.     I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'll finish with our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2018.     Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $40.1 million, $300,000 above the high end of our guidance range. Breaking revenue down further,subscription and support revenue was $36.9 million, which was up from $36.1 million in the year-ago period. Professional services revenue was$3.2 million in the quarter and was up from $2.5 million in the year-ago quarter.     On a geographic basis, we generated 58% of our revenue in the North America during the first (sic) [fourth] quarter and 42% internationally. Breakingdown international revenue a little bit more. Europe generated 16% of our revenue and Japan and Asia-Pac generated 26% of revenue during thequarter. Japan and Asia-Pac continue to be strong markets for us come as we won several more large deals during the quarter.     From a vertical market perspective, our media business represented 54% of our revenue in the quarter and our enterprise business represented43% of our revenue, while volume business represented the remaining 3%.     Let me now turn to the supplemental metrics we share on a quarterly basis. Our recurring dollar revenue retention rate in the fourth quarter was87%, which was below our target range of low- to mid-90s. However, as we noted earlier this year, we're working through a pricing reset andexpected our retention rates to be lower this year. We had a number of these contracts reset during the fourth quarter. We continue to expect thatthe full impact of the pricing reset will be between $10 million and $13 million, and it will conclude at the end of the first quarter.     Our customer count at the end of the fourth quarter was 4,168, of which 2,167 were classified as premium customers. We were pleased with ournew customer acquisition activity during the quarter, with a net 54 new customer additions.     Looking at ARPU. Within our premium customer base, our annualized revenue per premium customer was $73,000, which was up 3% year-over-yearand excludes our entry-level pricing for starter customers, which averaged $5,000 in annualized revenue.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Gross profit was $23.8 million, operating loss was $1.3 million and loss per share was $0.04 in the quarter.     Turning to our non-GAAP results. Our non-GAAP gross profit in the fourth quarter was $24.5 million compared to $24.8 million in the year-agoperiod and represented a gross profit margin of 61%. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit was driven by investments in strategic customersmade by our professional services team.     Subscription and support revenue represented approximately 92% of our total revenue and generated a 68% gross margin in the quarter, up 160basis points sequentially.     Non-GAAP income from operations was $1.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to a loss from operations of $309,000 in the fourth quarter of2016.     Adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 million in the fourth quarter, a significant improvement compared to $800,000 in the year-ago period and well abovethe high end of our guidance range in the quarter.     During the quarter, we recognized $1.2 million of onetime expense benefits that contributed to our strong bottom line performance. This includedthe reversal of an accrual related to a favorable tax determination in the state of Illinois as well as lower bonus expense. Even without these onetimebenefits, we would have been above the high end of our guidance range.     Non-GAAP income per share was $0.04 based on a 35.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss per share of $0.03on a 33.9 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year-ago period.     Looking at our full year 2017 results. Total revenue was $155.9 million, up 4% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was $91.3 million,operating loss was $19.7 million and loss per share was $0.57 based on 34.4 million weighted average shares outstanding.     On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit was $94 million, loss from operations was $9 million and adjusted EBITDA was negative $4.5 million and loss pershare was $0.26 based on 34.4 million weighted average shares outstanding.     Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $26.1 million. During the fourth quarter, wegenerated $5.2 million in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $4.2 million. After taking into account $1 million in capital expendituresand capitalized internal-use software. For the full year, we used $6.4 million of cash from operations and $10.6 million of free cash flow after takinginto account $4.2 million of capital expenditures and capitalized internal-use software.     I'd now like to finish by providing our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018. For the first quarter, we were targeting revenue of $40 millionto $40.5 million, including approximately $3 million of professional services revenue.     From a profitability perspective, we expect a non-GAAP operating loss of $1.9 million to $2.4 million and adjusted EBITDA loss of $800,000 to $1.3million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in a range of $0.06 to $0.08, based on 34.9 million weighted average shares outstanding.     Turning to our outlook for the full year 2018. We expect revenue to be in a range of $164 million to $168 million. This includes approximately $11.5million of professional services revenue for the year.     In terms of profitability, we're expecting a non-GAAP operating loss of negative $1.5 million to income of $1.5 million and adjusted EBITDA $2.5million to $5.5 million. In addition, we now expect non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.06 to income per share of $0.02 based on 35.2 million weightedaverage shares outstanding.     For cash flow, we expect full year free cash flow to be in a range of $1 million or $3 million. From a bookings perspective, we are targeting anotheryear of double-digit annual bookings growth, which reflects strong performance across business units and geographies. It's important to recognizethat our bookings guidance does not include the impact of our growing number of multiyear deals as well as a price escalators built into many of     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Bookings are an important part of our growth story. But ultimately, improved retention will be the biggest driver of consistentdouble-digit revenue growth we are driving towards.

And then, Kevin, on the professional services side, obviously, you're indicating a little bit down on the growth rate there. So I'm wonderingif you can provide a little bit of color as to why that is and whether or not this is just exercising some conservative philosophy here before investingfor new customer growth."

I mean, as we all know, we had some large service engagements last year related to some of those OTT deployments that we had. Thoseengagements have largely started to wind down. Of course, we've got a very good pipeline of OTT and SVOD opportunities. But as you canappreciate, those opportunities are a bit lumpy, unpredictable to forecast. And so at this point, we were a little bit more conservative in what ourrevenue guide would be until we actually ink those deals."

Yes, Mike, we are largely through some investments that we had made there on the services side for some of these large deals. As you canprobably appreciate, there is this services component, but then there is also subscription components for those 2. And we look at that as a blendeddeal of margin as opposed to one or the other. And so some of these did have investments, strategic investments with these customers on theservices side, but overall, we are pleased with the opportunity and the SVOD deals that we have overall. So I think in terms of like this year, we dothink we're going to get back to positive margins in services. We think that we still got a little more investment here in Q1, but not a lot. And then,certainly, less than what we had in Q4 and then should be positive in Q2 and beyond."

Definitely a positive sign that customers are signingmultiyear deals. But, I guess, generally, longer deals require some sort of concession. So I was curious since you did mention there is price ratchet,is there any sort of sweetener or discount you guys offer in the front part of the terms in order to get them to sign these longer-term price ratchetingdeals? Any color there would be helpful.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Thanks for joining the call and for the interest and for your question. Each deal is different. We view it as a whole. As a typical measure, wewon't be discounting the first year, but we certainly try wherever possible to get as much of a commitment as we can out of the totality of thecontract. Yes, I probably should share with you, there is a lot of value in these multiyear contracts that go beyond just the commitment. Certainly,the additional years help build our backlog, and our backlog did grow year-over-year in excess of 14%, and you'll see that when our K is filed in afew days. In addition, having the customers locked in for a longer period of time or I should say committed for a longer period of time, really enablesus to focus a number of different things. Number one, we can focus the account management dynamic and dialogue on ensuring the customersuccess rather than be caught in an annual cycle of having a renewal negotiation. And that's really valuable. Second, with a longer-term commitment,we're able to really reliably and confidently plan a product road map based upon what that customers' initiatives are. And so those are all reallygood things for us in helping operate the business."

And then just kind of talking about the enterprise, the mix of enterprise in media customers. In your opening remarks you kind of mentionedwhat I would it take to be primarily enterprise customers. So as we see growth throughout the year, should we expect more growth from theenterprise side, just given your ongoing traction? Or how do we think about kind of a customer growth in terms of media versus enterprisethroughout 2018?"
21,64390012,BRIGHTCOVE INC,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, BCOV",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Acting CEO, President & COO",True,False,"Sure. So we look at it holistically, of course, and we are interested in growth across the board. We are very excited about the enterprise space, andwe've had some real success and some excitement about our enterprise offerings. The media business is also growing quite nicely. And so we'vegot different areas of the world where different dynamics are playing out in different growth rates. And so, for example, we're seeing wonderfulexcitement and adoption for our media products in the JPac region. In North America, we're seeing great excitement and a lot of adoption, a newlogo adoption in particular on the enterprise side. And so we're excited about all of it."

And then just the last one for me. You guys mentioned one of the biggest opportunities in terms of cost savings is likely to come from theinfrastructure side. Is that to the extent that you guys can talk about it, is it contemplated into guidance that you guys will be driving savingsthrough infrastructure in 2018? Or is there possibility for outside to the current outlook if you guys are able to drive or maybe find more opportunitiesto cut costs in infrastructure?"

Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Acting CEO, President & COO",True,False,"Yes, I think -- I mean, our guidance contemplates everything that we can think of and reasonably forecast today. Of course, we'll be looking at areasacross the organization and certainly the infrastructure costs or the ability -- or the COGS, right, to deliver our service is certainly one of those areaswe will continue to focus on and try and drive costs out there and potential margin improvement in the future.

27,64390012,BRIGHTCOVE INC,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, BCOV",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Steven Bruce Frankel,"Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division",Senior VP & Director of Research,True,False,I'd like to dig in a little bit on the recurring dollar retention rate. And I know it's going to bounce around this year or in '17 because of the mediarepricing. Maybe could you give me some insight as to whether that was really the primary factor in Q4 that caused it to come in below normal?Or were there also maybe some smaller customers that didn't renew that contributed to that number?
28,64390012,BRIGHTCOVE INC,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, BCOV",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Acting CEO, President & COO",True,False,"No. Thanks for the question, Steve. No, the result that you saw was driven by and exactly in line with what we were anticipating due to the pricingreset. That was the fundamental driver."

Was it just a mix of deals? Or was there anything particular about themedia deals that repriced in this quarter that led to this result?"

A couple of different things. Number one, Q4 is one of our largest quarters. In fact, it is our largest quarter, and so more was up for renewal.And so there was a more pronounced impact and that played an effect here. And yes, each quarter is a different mix of deals because you've gotdifferent customers and contracts up. And so we did a little better than we thought and in some prior quarters. And now we got the full mix inthere. And so that's why this is within what we anticipated at the beginning of the year."

And where are you in transitioning your infrastructure to drive higher gross margins on the services and on the subscription side? Or are youthrough that transition to the cloud? Or you still have some legacy infrastructure that's coming off?
35,64390012,BRIGHTCOVE INC,02/22/2018," 10:00PM, BCOV",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Acting CEO, President & COO",True,False,"So we still have some legacy infrastructure that's coming off. However, the opportunities that we're looking at are -- involve more than simplymoving to the cloud. We are looking at all aspects of the architecture. We're looking at the relationships with our vendors across the board and anumber of other elements. It's not simply moving from legacy to cloud."

But it's the long tail of getting customers off some older technology that we have, that's being supported by thoseinfrastructure -- those data centers. And once we do that, we'll be fine."

Is it stillthe DIY focus that so many media companies have?"

Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Acting CEO, President & COO",True,False,"So it varies within the sub-geographies and the subregions out there. But certainly the DIY mentality is something, which is sort of the largestsingle, I'll call it, competitor that we come up against. We've had more and more success showing the value of not going DIY. And my referenceearlier to reaching a critical mass of referenceable deployment is relevant here that's sort of what I'm talking about, being able to show within theregion or within the different regions, examples of notable deployments by larger, well-known companies that are successfully outsourcing anddoing so efficiently and productively and are very well done execution presentation is really helping with that."
