4,64389602,COGENT COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, CCOI",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,Thaddeus G. Weed,"Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.","CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Treasurer",False,True,"Thanks, Dave, and again, good morning to everyone. I'd like to thank and congratulate the entire team at Cogent for their results and continuedhard work and efforts during another very busy year and a very productive year and quarter for the company.     We analyze our revenues, again, based upon network type, which is on-net, off-net and noncore. And we also analyze our revenues based uponcustomer type. And we classify all of our customers into 2 types, either NetCentric customers or Corporate customers. Our NetCentric customersbuy large amounts of bandwidth from us in carrier neutral data centers and our Corporate customers buy bandwidth from us in large multitenantoffice buildings.     Revenue from our Corporate customers grew sequentially by 2.9% to $78.7 million and year-over-year grew by 11.7%. We had 38,006 Corporatecustomer connections on our network at quarter end. Quarterly revenue from our NetCentric customers grew sequentially by 0.1% and year-over-yeargrew by 3.1%. We had 33,607 NetCentric customer connections on our network at quarter end. Our NetCentric revenue growth experiences morevolatility than our Corporate revenue growth due to the impact of foreign exchange and other seasonal factors.     Revenue and customer connections by network type. Our on-net revenue was $89.4 million for the quarter, which was a sequential quarterlyincrease of 1.7% and a year-over-year increase of 7%. Our on-net revenue was $346.4 million for the year, which was an increase of 7.1% over fullyear 2016. Our on-net customer connections decreased sequentially by 3.3% and increased by 16% year-over-year. We ended the quarter withover 61,300 on-net customer connections on our network in our 2,506 total on-net multitenant office buildings and carrier neutral data centerbuildings. Our off-net revenue was $35.7 million for the quarter, which was a sequential quarterly increase of 2.3% and a year-over-year increaseof 11.9%. Our off-net revenue was $137.9 million for the year, which was an increase of 12.7% over last year. Our off-net customer connectionsincreased sequentially by 2.4% and increased by 15.8% year-over-year.     (technical difficulty)     9,900 off-net customer connections and about 6,300 off-net buildings and these buildings are primarily in North America.     Some comments on pricing. Consistent with our historical trends, the average price per megabit of our installed base and for our new customercontracts decreased for the quarter. The average price per megabit for our installed base declined sequentially by 8.7% from last quarter to $0.99and declined by 21.1% from the fourth quarter of last year. The average price per megabit for our new customer contracts declined sequentiallyby 22.9% to $0.42, as we sold to larger customers compared to last quarter, and declined by 42.1% from our new customer contracts that weresold in the fourth quarter of last year.     Comments on ARPU, which decreased sequentially. Our on-net ARPU, which includes both Corporate and NetCentric customers, was $494 for thequarter, which was a sequential decrease of 1.7%. Our off-net ARPU, which is comprised predominantly of corporate customers, was $1,208 for thequarter, which was a sequential decrease of 0.9%. Churn rates were stable during the quarter. Our on-net churn rate was 1.1% this quarter comparedto 1% last quarter. And our off-net churn rate was 1.2% this quarter compared to 1.1% last quarter.     On [move back] change orders. We offer discounts related to contract term to all of our Corporate and NetCentric customers. We also offer volumecommitment discounts to our NetCentric customers. During the quarter certain NetCentric customers took advantage of our volume and contractterm discounts and entered into long-term contracts for over 2,500 customer connections which increased their [revenue commitment] to Cogentby over $22.5 million.     Some further comments on EBITDA and EBITDA as adjusted. Our EBITDA and EBITDA as adjusted are reconciled each quarter to cash flow fromoperations in all of our press releases. As adjusted includes gains related to our equipment transactions. Our quarterly EBITDA as adjusted increasedby $3 million or by 7.3% sequentially to $43.6 million and year-over-year increased by $5.8 million or 15.4%. Our EBITDA as adjusted increased by$14.5 million or by 9.7% for the year. Our EBITDA as adjusted margin increased sequentially by 180 basis points to 34.8% and increased by 200basis points from the fourth quarter of last year.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 509                Our equipment gains, that's included in the EBITDA, as adjusted were $0.3 million for this quarter, a decline from $0.7 million from the fourth quarterof last year and $0.4 million last quarter. The gains for the year were $3.9 million this year, a reduction from $7.7 million in 2016. Our quarterlyEBITDA increased by $3 million or by 7.6% sequentially to $43.2 million and increased year-over-year by $6.2 million or 16.6%. And our EBITDAincreased by $18.4 million or by 12.9% for the year. Our quarterly EBITDA margin increased sequentially by 180 basis points to 34.5%, one of thehighest rates recently, and increased by 240 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016.     We do have certain seasonal factors that typically impact our SG&A expenses and consequently that impacts our EBITDA and EBITDA as adjustedand those margins. And these include the resetting of payroll taxes in the United States at the beginning of each year, annual cost of living or CPIincreases, the timing and level of our audit and tax services and net neutrality fees and the timing and amount of our gains on our equipmenttransactions and benefit plan annual cost increases.     Some comments on earnings per share. As with many companies, the tax reform act impacted our income tax expense. So the signing of the TaxCuts and Jobs Act, which occurred in December of last year, reduced the corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, and thatresulted to an increase in our noncash deferred income tax expense by about $11.3 million booked in the fourth quarter and also impacted fullyear 2017.     Under U.S. GAAP, because of the change in the income tax rate, our net deferred tax assets had to be revalued in the fourth quarter using the lowerincome tax rate, with the gross amount remaining unchanged. The rate change impact represented about $0.25 of a loss per basic and dilutedshare, both for the quarter and for the year. As a result, our basic and diluted loss per share was $0.14 for the fourth quarter as compared to $0.08in the previous quarter and $0.09 in the fourth quarter of last year.     Our basic and diluted income per share was $0.13 for the full year compared to $0.33 last year. But if you exclude the $0.25 per share income taxexpense impact of this onetime $11.3 million adjustment, our basic and fully diluted income per share would have been $0.38, up from $0.33 forfull year and $0.11 increase as well for the fourth quarter.     Foreign currency impact. Our revenue reported in U.S. dollars and earned outside of the United States is about 23% of our worldwide revenues.About 17% of our fourth quarter revenues are based in Europe and about 6% of our revenues are related to our Canadian, Mexican and Asianoperations. Continued volatility in foreign exchange rates can materially impact our quarterly revenue results and our financial results. Foreignexchange had no material impact on our sequentially quarter revenues this quarter, but from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarterof this year the year-over-year FX impact on our reported quarterly revenue was a positive $2.1 million and for the year it was a positive $1.9 million.Our revenue growth on a constant currency basis, therefore, was 1.8% for the quarter sequentially, 6.6% over the fourth quarter of last year and8.1% for the full year. The average euro to U.S. dollar rate so far this quarter is now $1.22 and the average Canadian dollar exchange rate is about$0.80. Should these rates remain at these levels for the first quarter of this year, we estimate that the foreign exchange current impact on sequentiallyquarterly revenues would be a positive about $800,000 and the impact on year-over-year quarterly revenues an approximate $3 million positiveimpact.     Customer concentration. We believe that our revenue and customer base is not highly concentrated and our top 25 customers represented lessthan 6% of our revenues for the quarter.     Some comments on capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.6 million compared to $7.2 million for the fourthquarter of last year and $10.9 million for the previous quarter. Our capital expenditures were essentially flat for the year and were $45.8 million forthis year compared to $45.2 million last year.     Comments on capital leases and capital lease payments. Our capital leases are for long-term IRU obligations and typically have initial terms of 15to 20 years or longer and include multiple renewal options after the initial term. Our long-term and short-term capital lease obligations totaled$157.5 million at year-end. And we have a total of 230 different dark fiber suppliers that we use. Our capital lease principal payments are forlong-term dark fiber IRU agreements and these payments were $1.8 million for the quarter and $11.2 million for the year. Capital lease principalpayments, if you combine that with our CapEx, declined by 12.6% sequentially and that amount was $12.5 million this quarter compared to $14.2     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Capital lease payments combined with CapEx declined by 1.2% for the year and was $57 million this year compared to $57.7million last year.     At year-end our cash and cash equivalents totaled $247 million. And for the quarter, our cash decreased by $3.8 million as we returned $27.2 millionof capital to our stakeholders. During the quarter, we paid $21.8 million for our fourth quarter dividend and $5.3 million was spent on a semiannualinterest payment on our debt. For the full year our cash declined by $27.3 million, as we paid $81.7 million in our 4 quarterly dividends and $30.8million was spent on interest payments on our debt.     Some comments on debt and our ratios. Our total gross debt, which includes capital leases, was $732.5 million at year-end and our net debt was$48.5 million. Our total gross debt to trailing last 12 months EBITDA as adjusted ratio improved to 4.44 at year-end from 5.57 last quarter. And ournet debt ratio also improved to 2.94 from 3 last quarter. Our bad debt expense was only 0.5% of our revenues from our quarter, which was animprovement and was only 0.8% of our revenues for the year. Our days sales outstanding for worldwide accounts receivable was again only at 25days at year-end. And as with every quarter, I want to again thank and recognize our worldwide billing and collections team for continuing to doa fantastic job on customer service and collections.     And with that, I will turn the call back over to Dave."

I'd like to take a moment and comment on the scope and scale of our network and our network expansion. The size of our network continues togrow. We have over 893 million square feet of multitenant office building space connected to our network in North America. Our network consistsof 31,250 metro fiber miles and over 57,400 route miles of intercity fiber.     The Cogent network is one of the most interconnected networks in the world. Today, we directly connect with over 6,150 networks. Less than 30of these networks are settlement-free peers. The remaining networks are paying Cogent transit customers.     We are currently utilizing approximately 29% of lit capacity in our network. We routinely augment capacity in segments of our network to maintainthese low utilization rates. For the quarter we achieved accelerated sequential traffic growth of 12% and an improvement in our year-over-yeartraffic growth to 29%. We operate 53 Cogent-controlled data centers, with a grand total of 603,000 square feet of raised-floor space. We are todayoperating those facilities at approximately 31% utilization rate.     Our sales rep turnover rate was 3.5% for the quarter, significantly below our long-term average of rep turnover of 5.8%. We ended the quarter with455 sales reps selling our service. This is the greatest number of quota-bearing reps in the company's history.     Cogent is the low-cost provider of internet access transit services and VPN services and our value proposition remains unparalleled in the industry.Our business remains completely focused on internet IP connectivity and data center colocation services. What we are providing is a utility to ourcustomers and they recognize the value that we deliver. We expect our annualized constant currency long-term revenue growth rates to be withinour historical norms of 10% to 20% top line and we expect our long-term EBITDA as adjusted margins on an annual basis to increase by approximately200 basis points.     Our board of directors approved yet another increase to our regular quarterly dividend, increasing that dividend by $0.02 per quarter per share,to $0.50 per share per quarter. Our dividend increases recognize the continued optimism we have in the cash flow generating capabilities of ourbusiness. Increasing the dividend and continued delevering is a sign of the strength in our business.     We are optimistic about utilizing our buyback authorization and we'll try to take advantage of opportunistic situations to deploy the $41.5 millionremaining under our current buyback authorization, which continues through December of this year. We are committed to returning an ever-increasingamount of capital to shareholders on a regular basis.     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

One, Dave, on revenue growth, so constant currency growth this quarter was about 6.6%. It's the lowest we've seen in some time.Just wondering -- is this a little bit more of a newer reality at least in the interim? And then more specifically, what are the kind of catalysts do youexpect that help NetCentric growth reaccelerate? Because I think that's been the one piece of the business that the revenue growth has beensomewhat lagging. And then, secondly, just in terms of tax reform, wondering how that changes the company's outlook as it relates to bothinvestments in CapEx as well as capital allocation and shareholder returns."
8,64389602,COGENT COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, CCOI",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,David Schaeffer,"Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.","Founder, Chairman, CEO & President",True,False,"Thanks for the questions, Matt. So while our year-over-year quarterly constant currency growth rate was low, our constant currency sequentialgrowth rate in the fourth quarter was the best of the year, at 1.8%. We also do anticipate on a constant currency basis our growth rate to continueto improve, both on a sequential basis and on a year-over-year basis. I think the year-over-year fourth quarter was specifically distorted by somestrong growth in the fourth quarter last year that we didn't have from several very large customers. We do expect our NetCentric growth to improvefrom the 3.1% year-over-year growth rate that we delivered this year, which is substantially below our long-term average of 10% NetCentric growthrate. We are continuing to see a improvement in our traffic growth rates. So our sequential growth rate improved on a quarterly basis from 8% theprevious quarter to 12%. Even accounting for seasonality, our year-over-year growth rate continued to improve and improved throughout the yearand ended up at 29%. That is still below our long-term average, but we are seeing consistent improvement as the negative impacts of violationsof net neutrality continue to fade. We see new customer business models. We see existing customers taking more traffic. And we do feel that ourNetCentric business will continue to improve, albeit at a slow pace, but consistently improve, while our Corporate business continues to performalong historical trends and, quite honestly, quite consistent and quite well. The growth of 2.9% sequentially in that business and 11.7% year-over-yeardemonstrates the durability and consistency in that business. Now with regard to tax reform, clearly it had an impact on our reported EPS due tothe reversal of the tax reserve that we had taken adjustment for. Secondly, the tax act does, I think, institutionalize for 4 years bonus depreciationthrough 2022. That will most likely push out when Cogent will be a tax cash payer by about 3 years. We were initially anticipating having to makestructural changes to avoid cash taxes by mid-'19. Now I think that's more like mid-2022. We are still considering corporate structures and otherchanges to our tax policies to further minimize long-term taxes. Now with regard to capital expenditures, Cogent expends capital based on theexpected rate of return. We have excess capital on our balance sheet, and yet we continue to moderate our capital spending. Our CapEx as measuredby CapEx and principal payments on capital leases declined, albeit modestly, from $57.7 million to $57.0 million on a year-over-year basis. Weexpect those declines in absolute terms to continue going forward. Clearly, as a percentage of revenue the declines are more pronounced as wecontinue to grow top line. We do not see bonus depreciation or any other changes in tax policy having us accelerate our capital spending, becausewe don't think there are building opportunities to connect to that would generate sufficient returns. And we remain disciplined about our footprintexpansion."

I think you've been growing the sales force probablyhigh single digits, almost double digits at various times. Wondering how much of your growth outlook is dependent upon further sales forceexpansions along the lines of what we've seen. And then secondly, Dave, you just mentioned sort of the tax reform not impacting the capitalspending side. But maybe you can just help us understand what the opportunity is in terms of adding buildings onto your network. It feels asthough over time you've sort of downplayed the multitenant office building opportunity, yet we continue to see that being almost an equal driveras data centers in terms of adding buildings onto the network."
11,64389602,COGENT COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, CCOI",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,David Schaeffer,"Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.","Founder, Chairman, CEO & President",True,False,"Yes. Sure, Scott. So let me take each of those questions in order. We intend to grow our sales force between 7% and 10% for the year. We have asignificant addressable market opportunity and not enough sales people to cover that opportunity, both on-net and off-net. Our sales force isroughly 72% Corporate, about 28% NetCentric. We intend to grow both portions of the sales force to attack each of those markets. We think thatthe VPN migration away from MPLS to either VPLS or SD-WAN provides our Corporate reps with added addressable market opportunity. So as wethink about growing our business, we look at plenty of targets for us to sell to, a very predictable rate of price decline in the marketplace, bothCorporate and NetCentric after a number of years and a ability to continue to elevate our sales productivity. And the fact that we were able to gofrom 5.7 units installed to 5.8 and yet we had the most number of reps in the company's history, 455, the most number of full-time equivalent reps-- these are fully ramped reps -- of 429, our rep tenure continues to grow. So we will continue to invest in sales as the primary way to continue toaccelerate revenue growth. Now with regard to footprint expansion, we remain extremely disciplined about the type of buildings that we go into.Now we go into data centers as new data centers are being constructed. And there continues to be a significant amount of capital going into thedata center market that has had us continue to add to that footprint at the rate of about 65 to 70 facilities per year. We are in 800 data centerbuildings, with about 960 discrete data centers served. On the MTOB, or corporate multitenant office base, we continue to add about 60 a year.That has slightly decelerated. As we've seen the economy improve there has been some new construction of large buildings. Our average buildingsize remains consistent at about 550,000 square feet per building. In fact, if you do the arithmetic on the last quarter, the average building that weadded in the fourth quarter, MTOB, multitenant office building, was actually larger than the average. But we do have a very defined list of whichbuildings meet our criteria and we continue to go after those buildings, but we are not changing our criteria. We do not think the tax act has anyimpact on that decision because it's driven entirely by return on capital. And then with regard to the tax act and our ability to return capital toshareholders, dividends remained at the same tax rate. Corporate is lower but that has been not an important factor for Cogent. And we willcontinue to try to be thoughtful about returning capital as opposed to issuing taxable dividends and using buybacks when appropriate. So I thinkwhile the tax act is clearly a positive for business, it is not going to change the way we approach the market either to our customers or to ourshareholders."

I mean, the drivers for internet traffic growth and corporate customers needing the internet are much more profound andsubstantive than tax. The internet is a necessary utility to all of our customers. And what is driving their need for more bandwidth and moreconnectivity are their business applications, not their tax decisions. On the Corporate side, we are seeing an accelerated pace of MPLS VPNreplacement with various over-the-top strategies that I think will provide significant tailwind to the Corporate business. On the NetCentric side, asthe noise of net neutrality dies down and all of the last mile networks that had previously decided to block traffic are now freely upgrading theirports, we continue to see our NetCentric customers roll out new businesses, new applications.

So while we grew 29% year-over-year, the industry is only growing at about20%. So we're not at that 27%, 28% industry growth rate yet and we're not at the high 40s average Cogent growth rate."

15,64389602,COGENT COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, CCOI",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,Colby Alexander Synesael,"Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division",MD and Senior Research Analyst,True,False,"Two questions, if I may. First off, on CapEx, I've had the opportunity to cover Cogent for quite some time now. And I think if I go back a few years,at this point we're expecting CapEx to be -- and that includes cap leases -- to be in the low to mid-40s with a target of actually I think getting intothe high 30s at some point. Yet we're still at around that $57 million number that you referenced earlier. What's changed versus maybe expectationsa few years ago? And do you think that those lower numbers are still realistic? And then secondly, on growth specifically within the NetCentricbusiness and the 6.6% that was mentioned this quarter, you keep on mentioning net neutrality as one of the issues that is hindering growth. ButI have another thought that I wanted to suggest or get out there and see what you think. We've seen these hyperscale companies shifting a lot oftheir traffic needs out to an on-net, so buy more dark fiber, buy more wave lengths. And it seems like that's coming at the expense of IP transit,somewhat similar to how at one point they used to be big purchasers of CEN services and they brought that in house. Do you think that that's atrend that you're seeing impact your business and traffic growth? And could that also be part of the reason for why the traffic has slowed?"
16,64389602,COGENT COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, CCOI",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,David Schaeffer,"Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.","Founder, Chairman, CEO & President",True,False,"Yes, sure, Colby. Let me take both questions. First of all, on the CapEx question, our long-term CapEx guidance is that as methodically our capitallease and CapEx number will approach about $35 million. Clearly, $57 million is above that and the rate of decline has been slower. Now what hasprobably been a bit surprising over the past few years has been 2 things. One, the amount of data center footprint that Cogent has added to itsfootprint, Cogent-owned data centers; and then secondly, the accelerated rate at which new third-party carrier neutral data centers are being builtas measured by either square footage or megawatts of power. And because of that we are extending our network more aggressively. We have alsoextended our network to some new markets that were not initially contemplated, some of the Asia markets such as Singapore, Tokyo and HongKong. We do continue to evaluate other areas of the world and possibly could grow to those areas. But we do expect our absolute CapEx that isCapEx and principal payments on capital leases, to continue to decline, albeit at a slower rate of decline than we had expected. Now to the NetCentricgrowth rates. First of all, it is absolutely true that larger hyperscale companies -- and Cogent serves virtually every one of them -- have their ownproprietary data center footprint and they have built networks to connect those data centers to one another and to connect those networks tomajor exchange points. However, those companies continue to use transit services to connect to the internet. They have a discrete waterfall thatthey look to migrate traffic off of their networks. First and foremost, they seek settlement-free peering agreements. If anyone will give them freeconnectivity they will take it. And clearly that's a competitive offer that Cogent cannot, or does not want, to compete with. Secondly, they will usepaid direct connections. Those connections are typically more expensive than the market price for transit. And they will only use those if they areforced to under contract or if they feel that the underlying interconnections are at risk from their transit providers. Those fears are going away. Andthen, finally, transit, which is the easiest to use and most ubiquitous service with the lowest cost point, continues to be used by all of the hyperscaleplayers. In fact, we saw our traffic growth accelerate on a year-over-year and sequential basis. If your thesis was correct we would not see that. Nowthere is traffic that previously existed on the internet that no longer exists on the internet through direct connections. We've seen, for example,some of the over-the-top video providers take their traffic and no longer treat it as internet traffic, but rather as a channel on a linear closed cablesystem. That traffic disappeared from the internet. It is no longer over-the-top traffic and it is now being delivered on a closed network. That trendwill probably continue for some of the largest providers. But the aggregate amount of internet traffic continues to grow and actually is now growingat an accelerating rate. And for that reason, we feel optimistic that our NetCentric business is going to continue to improve, albeit at a slower pacethan we would have hoped.     9     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

So Dave, you've always described taking on debt as -- I think you've used the term renting cheap capital rather than amore permanent decision. Rates remain pretty low by historical standards. But what would we have to see for your calculus regarding the appropriatecapital structure for the business start to change?"
19,64389602,COGENT COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, CCOI",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,David Schaeffer,"Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.","Founder, Chairman, CEO & President",True,False,"Yes, fair enough. And I do view debt as temporary, not permanent capital; equity as permanent capital. And at Cogent, we have the luxury ofbuilding our business without debt and then taking on debt to accelerate returns of capital to our stakeholders, and, quite honestly, suffered somenegative carry by carrying excess cash on our balance sheet, such as the $247 million that we currently have. Our debt is fixed term debt withmaturities in '21 and '22. Our debt also is trading above par. So therefore, the market is still pricing our debt below our coupon for that debt. Interestrates have risen. We are probably in a short-term period of increased rates. Maybe this is my personal opinion, but I believe that the rate increaseswill be more benign than people think and maybe more short-lived. The underlying growth rates are still somewhat muted for the economy andinterest rates around the world remain extremely low. Of all those reasons, we will keep the debt structure that we currently have in place throughthose maturities. We may opportunistically look at extending maturities and/or increasing debt if it was cost effective. Today it is probably not.And we maintain the flexibility to actually pay off our debt if rates do materially increase. And you can see that with the substantial improvementin both our gross leverage and net leverage numbers. Our gross leverage improved sequentially from 4.57 to 4.44. That's a fairly material improvementin a given quarter. Our net debt improved from 3.00 to 2.94, again sequentially, again, a pretty significant improvement in a single quarter. Andwe expect those trends to continue for the next several quarters even with our increased dividend commitment."

That's helpful. And then maybe one on the cost side. You run a pretty lean operation. Are there [any] cost savings opportunities out therelike real estate rationalization or consolidating cross connects or automation that you might be able to take advantage of going forward or thathave been helping results as of late?
21,64389602,COGENT COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS INC,02/22/2018," 1:30PM, CCOI",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,David Schaeffer,"Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.","Founder, Chairman, CEO & President",True,False,"So I think the answer is yes to all of the above. I appreciate the compliment that we run a lean operation. We try to be cost-effective. You saw amaterial improvement on a sequential and year-over-year basis both in gross margin and in our SG&A efficiency, resulting in our operating leverage.Some comes from revenue growth. Some comes from continued real estate and other operational cost savings. We constantly evaluate our facilities,figure out if we can lower their costs. On cross connects, we've continued to migrate away from 10 GB cross connects for customers or peers thathave a large amount of traffic, to 100 GB. That grooming process is a significant savings. And then in terms of automation, our primary business isdelivering Internet, not developing new IS systems. However, we do have internal process improvement teams. We do consistently do more withless. And if you look at our headcount increases, almost all of our headcount, over 90% of the increase in employment at Cogent over the past yearcame in the sales organization, with less than 10% of our aggregate increase in headcount coming in operations. That is indicating that while ourrevenues grew at 8.6% and our traffic grew at 29%, the people that are actually producing the bit miles are becoming increasingly efficient. Andwe expect those trends to continue or possibly even accelerate."

Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. So clearly we need to be paranoid. Any business is at risk, and we cannot be complacent about ourimprovement in performance or even in our current performance. We have 15 years of experience. We have relationships with over 6,120 transitpurchasing networks. That is more than anyone else in the world. We monitor our customers' traffic literally on a daily basis and see changes intheir traffic patterns, both in terms of volume and destination or source, depending on whether it's an access network or a content-producingcustomer. And we are encouraged by the continued, albeit slower, improvement in aggregate internet traffic growth and our growth. We do notgenerate the demand for internet traffic. Those are end users doing that. The death of the internet has been predicted many times. Colby alludedto it with hyperscale carriers building their own networks. I've heard cross connects are going to put us out of business. CDNs are going to put usout of business. Extended peering exchanges are going to replace transit. Transit continues to dominate the market because it is the easiest to use,most ubiquitous and, most importantly, lowest cost way for anyone who has a large amount of content or needs to access a large amount ofcontent to get that content moved. Those trends are going to continue. Our NetCentric business and the growth in that business is dependent on3 very simple principles. One, is the market going to continue to grow? Two, is Cogent going to be able to continue to win new customers? And ifyou look at just the number of ASs connected in the progression in that path, it's been pretty consistent and improving and we continue to dothat. And then third, will we get a larger share of the wallet from those customers? And you actually saw some indication of that even this quarter.Now it's a negative indicator in the sense that our rate of sequential new-sale decline was greater than it had normally been, being that largecustomers were buying more of the traffic than small customers. There's a lot of dynamism in the NetCentric market. But we continue to grow andwe capture market share. And I feel very comfortable that we're going to see continued improvement. And again, the 3.1% year-over-year growthis low by our historic standards, but it's still better than the 0% growth or even negative growth that we were experiencing at the height of portcongestion. And you see the results of that in the operating leverage of the entire business and the increase in our on-net business."

Inc., Research Division",MD and Senior Analyst,True,False,"Just a couple of clarifications. If you continue on these trends, it looks like you're going to head down to below 2.5x debt to EBITDA next year. Isthat what you're kind of saying, that you're okay to let that happen? Or do you want to kind of maintain the debt to EBITDA more in the 3x rangewith stock buybacks? And then I had a follow-up."

So we have a stated range that we will maintain of between 2.5x and 3.5x on a net basis. We're actually below the midpoint andtrending down. We will maintain that range. And if we breach it on the low end, we would most likely either increase the pacing of our dividendincreases or be more aggressive about buybacks. That's a hypothetical. We're not there today. But we are committed to this leverage range. Nowto the question Nick asked, if interest rates materially spike, we may reevaluate that. But we're not talking about a 100 or even 200 basis pointincrease. Anything within that range, our thinking would stay consistent. And we are delevering at a fairly significant rate and we are growing ourdividend.

Or you'll just kind of see howthe market kind of plays out? And then related to that, your effective interest rate of 6.7% seems like it's really high versus the fundamentals.

Our goal is to kind of hover around the middle of the range, to be honest. That doesn't mean we would tolerate beingbelow that. Buybacks are something to use opportunistically. And the increase in volatility may give us some opportunity. But markets are still atall-time highs. With regard to our interest rates, remember, part of our interest rate is driven by our capital lease imputed interest, which we haveno control over. That is really the capital lease issuer's decision and based on the market points when we took on that debt through the capitalleases. With regard to the, I would call it more discretionary debt, our 2 high-yield instruments, the coupons are 5 3/8% and 5 3/8%. Both are tradingabove par. And I think the current mark-to-market on those is about 4.2 for the secured debt and about 4.5 for the unsecured debt. And with theunderlying increase in the 10-year, I think we're doing pretty well. I don't think there's a lot of opportunity for us to refinance that to a lower rate.And there is a make-whole associated with it."

So the calculation is what is net rentable. It does not include Cogent utilization within the centers for our equipment. Two, we did see a slightuptick from 30% to 31% sequentially in the quarter in terms of utilization. And we did not add any new data center footprint. We also have about18 months ago implemented a data center certification program for our sales force. If a rep goes through that additional training and passes it,they actually get some additional compensation on data center sales, which has helped us sell additional rack and power in our footprint. Our datacenters are relatively low power density. So it is probably not totally fair for us to compare them to some of the other operators. We have about 70megawatts across our footprint or about 125 watts per square foot as opposed to most public operators at about 250 watts per square foot. Sothere are some structural differences. But there are many customers, mostly corporate, who our data center is a very good footprint and fit for, andwe expect to see that continue to grow. It represents about 2.9% of revenues and 4.9% of our actual connections, our rack and power, in our datacenters. Now with regard to the NetCentric sales force, we are continuing to grow that force. And we do anticipate that over 2018, the growth rateof NetCentric salespeople will be greater than that of corporate. Both sales organizations will grow, but there will be probably a greater emphasison NetCentric as we're seeing the underlying demand in that segment continue to improve."

So I appreciate the lower power density. Maybe asked a different way, what will your utilization look likeif you looked at it, say what percentage of your 70 megawatts that you have that you have sold? Would that be a higher percentage? So I wouldassume higher power density gear is taking less floor space, but using substantially more power. So how would the metrics stack up under thatsort of scenario?"

So when we put the theoretical number out there, it's actually built off of the mostconstricted variable on each of the 53 centers. So there's no one answer to that.
