My name is Kennen MacKay. I am one of the biotech analysts here at RBC. And it is my great pleasure tobe hosting Immunomedics in our next fireside chat here.     And from Immunomedics, we have Michael Pehl, the President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as Michael Garone, the Vice President of Financeand Chief Financial Officer. Thank you very much for joining us today."

4,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.",President and CEO,False,True,"Yes. So I think many of you are aware that Immunomedics has not always been a company striving for being fully integrated. The Company wasset up as a research organization and worked at that for many years.     That has changed with the change of the Board. And by the way, the Chairman of the Board is also sitting here, Behzad, who many of you mayknow. But then also with the new leadership team that we brought onboard.     And we think we have a great platform at hand, not just with IMMU-132 of ADC assets that are pretty unique and very differentiated. But also withothers that go after other targets. And not just for solid tumors, but also hematological malignancies.     With that at hand and kind of with the expertise that we have inside of Immunomedics from a science perspective but also external talent that webrought in, we think we are now very well positioned to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, which means manufacturing,clinical, commercial, all-in.     2     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

And of course, the big milestone for us in front of us is our first submission with our firstasset in metastatic triple negative breast cancer."
5,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,Analyst,False,True,"Perfect. And so speaking of that first asset, so that IMMU-132. And obviously in triple negative breast cancer, where we've seen some very impressiveresponses as we think about sort of the treatment paradigm there.     And interestingly, IMMU-132 had sort of been developed in a very different direction than ADCs I think were sort of moving at the time. This isn'tsort of the most toxic payload that's out there, and this isn't sort of the most payload you can conjugate to an antibody.     So can you maybe just -- before we dive into some of the clinical data, give us a background on the molecule? And perhaps why that has enabledit to be successful here where other ADCs or other antibodies haven't been?"
6,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.",President and CEO,False,True,"Yes, no, thanks. And it starts with the notion of it's really different. The paradigm of ADCs so far has been you have to have a very toxic warhead orpayload and you have to have a stable linker. And one is a little bit of a function of the other. If you have a very toxic payload in order to avoidoff-target side effects, you have to have this very stable linker, right?     What that means is kind of the antibody needs to be internalized and then kind of the chemotherapy needs to enzymatically be cleaved off. TheCompany Immunomedics or our Company went a different path, starting with the payload, which is the active metabolite of irinotecan. Very activedrug, but certainly not comparable to this super-toxic payloads that other companies have been using.     And due to the fact that we have SN-38 as our warhead, we can afford to have kind of a moderately stable linker. That has a couple of advantages:the drug is released at the tumor very, very quickly and it can actually be released not just in the tumor but also at the tumor when the antibodyis binding.     So you have an effect in the cell, but you also have an effect at the tumor. And we think the efficacy and the tolerability profile of the drug, whichis actually very different to others, is a function of this differentiated way to look at ADCs."
7,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,Analyst,False,True,"And so maybe just getting into the clinical data. Phase 2 trial, where we've seen a pretty impressive response rate, especially considering this is,again, triple negative breast cancer, a 34% response rate and PFS of 5 1/2 months. Overall survival out over a year.     Can you maybe put this into context of how that compares to current standard of care? And I guess how we should be thinking about alternativetherapies for these agents?"
8,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.",President and CEO,False,True,"So the current therapy of this patient is really driven by clinical experience rather than by approved drugs. There is no approved drugs, unfortunately,in triple negative breast cancer. That's a shame, but it is like that. That's the first thing to say.     The second thing to say that the current standard of care, which is taxanes, if those patients have not been pretreated before, which is platinumcompounds, which is eribulin, which is vinorelbine, is insufficient. It produces a lot of toxicity but very little efficacy.     3     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

If you have patients with two or more prior treatments, you are talking about aresponse rate of 10% to 15%. You are talking about the progression-free survival of one to three months. And you measure the duration of responsein weeks. Almost to a point where you think you are harming patients more than doing something good to them.     That said, I think a drug such as sacituzumab or IMMU-132 comes up with a very different proposition. The response rate that has been essentiallyadjudicated was 31%, but that doesn't mean that only a third of the patients is responding. We have actually round about 70% of the patients whohave some sort of tumor response, which is very different to what you see with chemotherapy.     The duration of response is not measured in weeks, it's measured in months. So again, talking about the centrally adjudicated data here, which aremostly of interest. That's round about nine months; that's very, very different. And we have been talking about the progression-free survival already.     I think that offers this patient population kind of a very, very different treatment paradigm. When you are looking at the toxicity side, there's twomain side effects. As expected, as you have a topoisomerase-1, you have some hematological toxicity. You have neutropenia. About 40% of thepatients have Grade 3/4 neutropenia.     What I have to say is that as part of the protocol that led to the 110 patients that we presented and is going to go into the package to FDA, therewas not a very consistent use of GCSF. We changed this now in our confirmatory Phase 3 study. So in the package that you saw in San Antonio andthat we are submitting to the regulatory authorities, we had 7% of febrile neutropenia.     40% Grade 3 doesn't make an oncologist nervous. What makes the oncologist nervous is if the patient goes home and then gets fever, right? Thatwas out of 7%. We think we can bring this down substantially by GCSF use throughout. And --"
9,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,Analyst,False,True,"Can you just remind us what level of GCSF use was in that trial and why that is? I would think that is part of routine treatment in breast cancerespecially, unless this is in a country where GCSF isn't available."
10,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.",President and CEO,False,True,"Yes, that's right. Most of the use has been therapeutic. So patients got it when they had febrile neutropenia before and they got it like three or fourdays. I think the way to think about here is a slightly different one.     If a patient had a Grade 3/4 neutropenia in the previous cycle, you would probably like to avoid the situation in subsequent cycles. Because thesepatients are going to have neutropenia key events again.     So you try to do what I think in terms of GCSF use you would try to describe as secondary prophylaxis rather than a pure therapeutic use. That'sthe main difference here. If you do this, I think we can bring down the febrile neutropenia rate, which is already low, very substantially.     The other side effect of note is gastrointestinal, but most of it is of low grade. That is very different, for example, than when you are thinking aboutirinotecan so -- but that's basically it. And that compares, I think, extremely favorably versus other cytostatics that is out there."
11,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,Analyst,False,True,"Yes. And then again, thinking about, I guess, a comparator here to the chemo that these patients are getting, what should we be thinking aboutfor a sort of response rate there? Like, sub sort of 20% and just maybe a month or two months of PFS? And again, that's sort of thinking aboutfrontline chemo treatment in TNBC patients and not the four-plus priors the majority of these patients have had to [retrial].     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

12,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.",President and CEO,False,True,"No, I agree with you. And so if we work the way upwards for patients with more than two treatment lines, the literature shows that you can achieveresponse rates of 10% to 15%. We are talking about three times more here and a treatment -- a duration of response of weeks. We are talking aboutmonths.     If you work your way upwards, so if you look at the taxanes, which are standard of care in the absence of other opportunities. And by the way, manyof these patients already saw taxanes as part of their adjuvant therapy. So taxanes are not even an option anymore or platinum.     In a first-line triple negative metastatic setting, you see round about 30%. Now, that's something you can achieve with sacituzumab or IMMU-132in a third-line-plus setting. In the data set that we had, more than 6% of the patients had more than four prior treatment lines. Every single of thispatient has been treated with taxanes. So that's not even representative of the numbers that I just gave to you. It's an even further down treatmentline.     We also had about 20% of the patients who on top of the treatment with multiple lines of chemotherapy had been treated with checkpointinhibitors. Even in that population, we saw a response rate of more than 40%.     So I think it's very consistent; it's much, much higher than what you currently see with the so-called standard of care. And as I was trying to say, it'sa very consistent throughout all the subgroups. It is independent of age; it's independent of whether you got three lines or four lines or five lines.     It's independent of usage with chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor versus chemotherapy alone. You always end up with this kind of 30% to40% response rate and the majority of patients having some sort of a response.     The message here is the benefit of the drug is not driven by a subgroup. It is driven throughout. I think that's a very, very remarkable result whenyou look at how heavily pretreated those patients have been."
13,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,Analyst,False,True,"And just putting the prior checkpoint treatment into context, I think that exemplifies how desperate these patients really are. Because this isn'texactly an immunologically hot tumor. This is perhaps one of the colder tumor types out there where checkpoints really don't see activity.     So putting this into context, what are sort of the next steps and timelines associated with the regulatory submission? What else does need to getdone?"
14,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.",President and CEO,False,True,"So we communicate in our earnings call that the timeline or the time point of our submission is end of May. We had previously communicated atimeline that was a couple of weeks earlier, but there is some additional work ongoing in terms of assays that the FDA has been asking us to do.And PK work that just needs to be finished and finalized in the right quality and that has shifted the timeline a little bit.     The other work stream that is ongoing and where we have really made great progress is process validation. So doing validation runs of the antibody,of the linker, of the conjugation and of the fill/finish. Most of that work is done, so the antibody work is done.     The linker work is almost done and we are now doing the last work with our partner BSP in Italy, who does the conjugation fill/finish. So we arereally going to come in very nicely against that timeline.     The third major thing for us is preparing for a preapproval inspection. That's what the FDA usually does. That's totally not unusual for our Company.Every company with a biologic gets that.     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

She turns basically every stone between NewJersey and New York, I can tell you. And she also brought in a lot of consultants with an FDA background, so we feel that we are extremely wellprepared.     Submission is front and center for us without any doubt. But I think we are doing extremely well against the timelines and the work that needs tobe done."
15,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,Analyst,False,True,"And what kind of label could we be anticipating here? I guess thinking about the patient population that was involved in that trial, what I guessnumber of prior lines of therapy could sort of be implied by the cycle?"
16,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.",President and CEO,False,True,"I think it's going to be a reflection of what we've been having with this 110 patients. And again, the data that we showed in San Antonio is exactlythe data that the FDA gets from us. So it's probably fair to say or to assume that it will be patients with three or more treatment lines and patientswho have been pretreated with taxanes.     By the way, most of these patients saw taxanes. So that's -- now, the question is what does that mean for usage, right? In terms of usage, I wouldmake an anticipation. And this is where US is very different to Europe. I come from Europe, as you can hear from my strange accent. So in the US,I think, thank God, the usage is driven by medical need and the data that you have at hand.     All the key opinion leaders that we talked to told us that there is no difference between the second-line situation and the third-line situation.Patients are as desperate after one treatment line than they are after two treatment lines. There is just nothing available.     What that means is, at least in the academic centers, everybody is going to use the drug in the second-line setting right from the get-go. In thecommunity setting, I think it's prudent and important that we are able to include data into the NCCN treatment guidelines. Generating this datais an absolute priority for the Company and we are setting up the respective protocols as we speak.     But we think we are going to see a lot of second-line usage right from the get-go, which we are then going to complement with more data in thesecond-line setting. So the data is a reflection of the data but -- the label is a reflection of the data that you have. But I think the usage is going tobe broader right from the get-go."

And thinking about some of those trials -- again, not registrational trials, but smaller trials that could just help inform usage and get 132 onguidelines. How are you thinking about these? Are these going to be ISTs? And if those are getting set up, why not include some frontline patientsthere?"

So generating second-line data is a key priority for us, and that'sgoing to be in monotherapy. We are going to not run these as an IST, but rather as a Company-sponsored study because we feel there's also froma translational side there's quite a lot to learn.     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

We want to understand why patients are relapsing. Is that a chemotherapy-driven event? Does that have to do with loss of antigen orboth?     What about certain subgroups? Triple negative breast cancer is not a homogeneous treatment group. There was recent publications showing thatthere's very different molecular subtypes and gene expression profiles. And we just want for kind of the future work that is in front of us, which isfrontline, which is combination, we just want to obtain as much data as we can. So that's one priority.     Second priority for us -- and again, we would do this as a Company-sponsored -- is monotherapy and combination in first line. We think in orderto cover triple negative breast cancer completely, we need to do both. Many patients are not going to tolerate a combination therapy, althoughit's probably a safe bet to say that a combination could be more effective.     So in order to really own that, space you need to do both. From a data generation perspective, that priority for us, again, means set up a protocol,have it up and running in the next 12 months. We want to generate monotherapy data because ultimately we will have to compare ourselvesdirectly head-to-head versus a platinum or a taxane. And we want to understand what the profile of our drug is as monotherapy.     Talking about combination, we have three options here: one is chemo; one is PARP. PARP have been approved now in triple negative breast cancer.Thank God something is approved in that indication, although only for a very, very small subset of patients: 15% of the patients. There is a BRCAmutation part. We think there's an opportunity through the combination to have broad utility for all patients, not just for the BRCA.     And then depending on whether PD-1s and PD-L1s, to your point, make it to registration, the Phase 3 trials we are going to see soon, probably thisyear, PD-1 and PD-L1 combinations are also of interest.     The third big data generation bucket for us, as you will see -- [I can't say]; we have not talked about that yet -- where we have similarly intriguingdata that we showed last year at the ESMO congress, we make a major effort to update our data with a longer observation period and go intosubgroups and making those data available.     But at the same time, we want to set up protocols in anticipation of positive discussion with the authorities. Because we believe there could be apath to accelerated approval as well. And upon advice and input of the regulatory authority, we would set up this protocol to reflect it. And again,this study should be up and running in the next 12 months."

Before we do, two questions here. One: should we be thinking about a biomarker here? Thisis targeting Trop-2. Do we need to be screening for Trop-2 expression in these patients?"
20,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.",President and CEO,False,True,"No, we don't. So we are looking for Trop-2 expression because we want to learn. We are not discriminating between patients that have or have notor have high or have moderate or have low. 90% of the patients have a moderate or high expression of Trop-2.     There's also -- we have a SPA, agreed protocol with the FDA. That is currently recruiting as our confirmatory study. The FDA has also clearly told usthey don't expect any patient stratification.     That said, there is other indications other than triple negative breast cancer, other than breast cancer as such or urothelial cancer, where the Trop-2expression may be lower. We know for example from prostate cancer that Trop-2 expression is around about 70%. And that's when you start toscratch your head and say like maybe I should have a biomarker in the population.     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Not justbecause they did some initial encouraging experiments with our drug in advanced prostate cancer, but also because they have some exquisiteexperience to determine Trop-2 expression from circulating tumor cells.     So part of the effort that we have to undergo is not just having a validated assay for the future, but ideally to also have this assay from circulatingtumor cells so that we don't have to torture patients anymore by getting tumor samples."

And so maybe we can move to urothelial now. Again, a very large market, very high unmet need. Perhaps a little bit more crowded thantriple negative breast cancer. We have seen some data from checkpoints here where it's at least look like a rather viable strategy.     Can you sort of remind us what the data we've seen to date is in terms of response rates and durability? And then again, thinking about sort of apath forward in urothelial, sort of where we are today?"
22,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.",President and CEO,False,True,"Happy to do that. So we showed data of 41 patients at the ESMO congress last year. They were all obtained in patients who got -- who were eitherrelapsed or refractory to prior chemotherapy.     Round about a third of these patients have received checkpoint inhibitors. And round about a third of the patients had liver mets. That is the worstpopulation of all. The observation period, I have to say, in those patients was still rather short, but still what we were able to show is a 34% responserate, which by the way is higher than what checkpoints achieve in a second-line population.     In a second-line population with checkpoint inhibitors, you achieve round about 20% to 25%. We had a higher response rate in a population thatwas much later. Just wanted to make that point."

24,64412466,IMMUNOMEDICS,02/22/2018," 8:05PM, IMMU",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.",President and CEO,False,True,"And even in frontline, the results are not very much better. I agree. So that's one thing. We were able to show a 12-months duration of response,which I think, again, for that population is something unheard of. And a progression-free survival of six to seven months. So that's a pretty uniqueprofile. We think this is absolutely a best-in-class asset.     That said, the next step for us is to kind of re-analyze the data. That's what we are currently doing because we have a much longer observationperiod now. Go into those subgroups, because it's encouraging to see this kind of response rates and durations overall.     But what about the patients that had checkpoint inhibitors, right? Because thinking about an accelerated approval, that's what the Agency is goingto think about. And upon having those data at hand and publishing them.     In parallel, of course, as I was trying to say, we are talking to the FDA about give us the exact definition of a patient population where you think anaccelerated path is achievable. And let's set up the protocol that we are working on exactly reflecting that. So that's the first step.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

So rather than having a second-line population after you have your third-line population, that's thesituation that we have in triple negative breast cancer. We will certainly make an effort to have both of them at the same time.     Even though you may not have an approval at hand, in case there is an accelerated path and the data looks good, we just want to broaden ourdatabase right from the get-go. And then, of course, again, same game. You think about frontline. In thinking about frontline, you think about twothings: checkpoint inhibitor combination, chemo combination. And that's, again, a data generation effort that is imminent for us."
