You're continuing to target 40% EBITDA margins exiting 2018, but you're elevating yourinvestment spending in the first several quarters of the year. Out of the categories of investment spending that you've outlined, howmuch of that investment do you expect to be temporary in nature, thus giving you confidence that you can actually hit your 40%target?"
2,64389773,COSTAR GROUP INC.,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, CSGP",Q4 2017 CoStar Group Inc Earnings Call,Scott T. Wheeler,"CoStar Group, Inc.",CFO & Principal Accounting Officer,False,True,"Yes. George, this is Scott. When you look at what we're investing in, I listed a number of things: expansion of our sales force;improvements in research; to continue expanding a little bit internationally. All those things are intended to go after these revenuegrowth targets that we have and also increase the revenue pace as we go forward. So what we'd rather do now as we go forward,unlike 2017, where we made significant investments and didn't grow our margins, as we go forward, we want to keep pacing inthese smaller investments as we go and keep raising the margins, like we're doing now, the 350 basis points. So we balance theinvesting we need to fuel growth in the future with the margin improvements that we need to make to both hit our commitmentsand to give the returns that we committed to. So I don't think I would call any of them temporary. The litigation costs we had inXceligent, obviously, were temporary and we'll see those moderate as we go through the year. But the rest of these things areworthwhile investments for the business."

I know that you haven't given us margins by segment in the past. And I was just wondering if youcould just at least give us a sense of what the margin trajectory has been like, I guess, the last 12, 18 months in the multifamily side.And as you scale that, cover your fixed cost, how has that progressed generally?"

We aren't describing -- we're not reporting it at that level. However, I can give you a feel for it. I did asimple chart the other day of investments being big, red negative bar charts and then 4-wall profit being green. And basically, wewent through -- in '15 and '16, we -- '15, we went through a very significant year of investment as we ramped up the nationwidebrand advertising. Sales kicked up in '16. Those investments basically dropped. Net investment dropped in half, as revenues offset.And we were -- I was very pleased in '17 to see clear-cut strong 4-wall profitability in Apartments.com. And then after we get throughall the noise and friction of closing a major acquisition, and even without it, then you move into even stronger margin growth. So Ithink the margins we're seeing now, the contribution we're seeing from Apartments.com is very successful and, certainly, dramaticallymore margin than we ever saw from the individual acquired company. So really good results, we think, people that we're very happywith."

I think you said the blended rate between the non-payers and the payers was something like $50 a user per month,and you're making net $500. So just reiterate -- I want to make sure I got that right. And then how does that -- is that the data thatwe've gotten so far on the 5,400? And do we expect that same kind of pricing lift to continue? Or will it taper? I mean, are we gettingthe most juicy leads now and it should get less juicy over time in terms of pricing? Can you kind of go through that?"
11,64389773,COSTAR GROUP INC.,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, CSGP",Q4 2017 CoStar Group Inc Earnings Call,Andrew C. Florance,"CoStar Group, Inc.",Co,False,True,"Sure. Yes, so you're right. It's again just like the last time, we really pushed this a couple of years ago. The majority of the folks choosingto subscribe go from heavy searching in LoopNet to subscribing to CoStar to get better information product. There are folks payingabsolutely nothing to LoopNet currently. So most of them are paying nothing. Those who are paying are paying $149. The blendedrate is $49. We're picking them up at about $520, $540 net, as they go into CoStar. So fantastic, 10x sort of uplift. To answer yourquestion, are we getting the low-hanging fruit first, absolutely not. I've sat there, I've been in 20 or 30 cities in the last month andsat in a lot of focus groups watching people talk. And this, it's pretty straightforward to us. But as people sort out the differencesbetween the different products and LoopNet as a marketing platform, CoStar as an information platform, it takes a little bit of time.Still, the #1 competition to CoStar is these folks using the -- being heavy searchers in LoopNet or formerly using Premium Searcher.With the changes in the integrated back-end, when these people go into LoopNet product today, they're now seeing all the CoStaricons showing listings that they can't see using their LoopNet account, and it's very compelling. And it will take a little bit of time.The people aren't going to immediately commit to a 1-year, 2-year, 3-year CoStar contract. They've got to actually sort out.

Honestly, we have a bigger opportunity than we have number of salespeople. We mitigatethat. We're shifting our resource around. But it's something that takes time. And there isn't something -- there's still very significantsystem flow of folks who, we think, will continuously come in and upgrade to CoStar. February will be -- we are eliminating some ofthe standard pricing we had in December, January. We're being more rigorous in our pricing controls. But big picture, we anticipateit will flow throughout the year and into '19, and it's a very compelling proposition -- value proposition to folks. But it just isn'tsomething where to turn a switch and people will jump over. It takes time."
12,64389773,COSTAR GROUP INC.,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, CSGP",Q4 2017 CoStar Group Inc Earnings Call,Operator,NA,NA,False,True,Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America.
13,64389773,COSTAR GROUP INC.,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, CSGP",Q4 2017 CoStar Group Inc Earnings Call,David Emerson Ridley,Lane,"BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division",False,True,"So LoopNet had roughly 1,700 paying customers. You had another 80,000 pretty intensive users. Given the conversions to date, youconverted just 5% of the base. I'm curious what drove the decision to accelerate the conversion, particularly because you had theXceligent bankruptcy, which is obviously a large opportunity that you need to capitalize on as well."
14,64389773,COSTAR GROUP INC.,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, CSGP",Q4 2017 CoStar Group Inc Earnings Call,Andrew C. Florance,"CoStar Group, Inc.",Co,False,True,"Okay. So I think the number of subscribers is close to 32,000 because you have to look at folks who were getting Premium Lister witha subscriber element or unlimited listers. So the numbers is not -- I think it's higher than 17,000. It's closer to 30 -- 32,000. And thenyou had another 50,000, 60,000 that we classify as heavy searchers on LoopNet. The reason you would accelerate -- like, so you're --originally, we had contemplated rolling out that Premium Searcher over a 12-, 18-month time frame just to continue the rolling timeperiod. When you look at the folks who are using Xceligent as an information system, a very, very large number were supplementingthe inadequacies of Xceligent's system by using LoopNet, so it's actually one and the same thing. And the changes that occurred atXceligent, you're working against yourself when you are providing a Premium Searcher product to someone that you're trying toconvert into CoStar. So you're probably -- you're providing a low-cost, low-value product to them to prevent them from making adecision to go over to CoStar. And you plan to eliminate it anyhow and you communicate it to them prior to the Xceligent bankruptcythat you're going to eliminate it anyhow. And also, I think we have to work to a slightly higher standard now on how we treat all ourcustomers given our increased competitive position. So we didn't want to be in any situation where we were picking and choosingwhich markets or which people we eliminate Premium Searcher on and have any image that we were handpicking discontinuedXceligent clients to discontinue their Premium Searcher. So we went ahead and just did across-the-board and including, in somecases, making the right choice, the difficult choice to eliminate Premium Searcher with a person who was also subscribing to CoStarcurrently, so it's just good customer service. But they're related. They're directly related. It's one and the same decision-makingprocess. And by doing this, we facilitate a faster, good result across the overall, though you take a -- it requires a little bit of extracharacter in the first half of the year. By the way, I listened to -- we have a pretty sophisticated phone system, monitoring system. Itcan listen to sales pitches and you just listen to -- I listen to 100 salespeople trying to sell various products to former Xceligent folks.And you can see the person saying, ""Well, I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do,"" while you're watching them do 100 searchesthat we can LoopNet Premium Search it, like we're just working against ourselves here. So that's really why they're related."

So you're netting out, call it, $500 on these conversions. Given that hugeuntapped base that you still have yet to convert, based on the focus groups that you've done, what do you think is realistic in termsof how -- what percentage that you can bring over and at what price point? Because I think, at the beginning of the process, you'vetalked about maybe doing a $200 level of functionality, maybe a $400 level of functionality and then we'll call it CoStar. Had thatkind of pricing approach or strategy morphed as you've done more work in the space?"
17,64389773,COSTAR GROUP INC.,02/22/2018," 4:00PM, CSGP",Q4 2017 CoStar Group Inc Earnings Call,Andrew C. Florance,"CoStar Group, Inc.",Co,False,True,"Yes, it changed a little bit. So it's a -- we initially were focusing on, as you said, the $200, $400. We're not getting a lot of pickup inthe $200. People are -- if they know what they're -- if they don't know what they're doing, some of them accidentally buy the $200.But this is what they do for a living. This is their trade. This is their Bloomberg terminal. And the $400 solution is incredibly powerfuland gives them an amazing information solution with tons of revenue-generating opportunities. The $200 is adequate and meetseverything that LoopNet Premium Searcher was doing and a lot more. So I think it's probably 19 of the $400 to 1 of the $200. Andthat's just what people are opting for. And I think it's actually shifting even further. So I think it will be like sub-5%, sub-3% of thelower cost solution at the customers' behest. So -- and again, in the focus groups, it's just amazing how they're all just trying to figureout what's going on. You've got Xceligent. You've got these board systems. You've got LoopNet Premium Searcher, Premium Lister.You've got CoStar. And you would think it was pretty easy for them to sort it out. There's a lot of confusion out there. And what we'redoing is we're really simplifying that decision-making process for them. And it will take 1 year or so to sort of really simplify this andget them migrated into the right products. But we're highly confident that a very substantial portion of these folks will ultimatelybe using CoStar for information and LoopNet for marketing. One of the things I don't think we spent a lot of time on the call thatdid come out loud and clear in these most recent rounds of focus groups is one of the beautiful things here is LoopNet remainsviewed by our customers as an essential utility to marketing their listing to end-users. CoStar is viewed as an essential utility for -- avery valuable utility for information solutions. So as we're doing this, the marketing side of LoopNet, to me, has never looked stronger.The information side in CoStar has never looked stronger. And there's a whole bunch of painful confusion in the middle there inthose information products, and that's going to take 1 year to sort out."

We've seen that same patternin the last couple of years and our spend is concentrated around the TV and the broadcast for the apartments marketing in thesummer months. So we really don't see that kind of pressure coming into the fourth quarter, unless something unusual happened.Like this year, with the bankruptcy of Xceligent, we went around and spent quickly and mobilized, but at least...     15     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

So on the ForRent acquisition, you mentioned you're going to be bumping the size of the sales forceon the multifamily side by 50%, which is a real positive.

So we -- we have grown the sales force over time at a prettier clip. We reorganize it from time to time,as we have an unbelievable amount of opportunity to reach new customers on both the CoStar side and the Apartment side. In theApartment side, one of the big drivers there is that people with smaller and smaller communities are spending money advertisingon Apartments.com network. So we get to all of our customers or 95% of our customers every quarter for service, but we only getto 10%, 15% of the prospects every quarter. And we want to get to all of them every quarter.

Someone has been in a pattern doing something within a company for15 years and there's a big change like a merger with another company. People make decisions about what they want to do, andthat's healthy and that's good. Some significant number will find the opportunity with Apartments.com really exciting. They'll thinkbeing on the clear-cut winning team is exciting. There'll be, without a doubt, more earnings potential for them with the Apartments.comnetwork. And some people may have been -- alternately, some folks will decide that the last 20 years at ForRent had been great andthey're going to do something else or hang it up now. They're both fine. And we do anticipate and have planned for some numberof people to decide to do something different. So that number will come down a little bit during the year. Eventually, we'll rebuildit at a slow pace. But net-net, you're going to end up with a great infusion of talented people that decide to make this their long-termhold -- home. And it won't be the whole number that you start with, but it will be a good number. And they'll also bring a lot ofknowledge and culture and that's valuable to us, the rev-up on everybody.
