Good morning. I'd like to thank you all for joining the PRA Health Sciences conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and fullyear 2017 financial results.     I'm pleased to report that the fourth quarter of 2017 was another strong quarter with double-digit revenue, adjusted net income and net newbusiness growth. Service revenues for the fourth quarter were approximately $569 million, which represents an increase of approximately 38%year-over-year at actual foreign exchange rates and 36% on a constant currency basis. Service revenues, excluding Symphony, increased approximately20% year-over-year at actual foreign exchange rate and 19% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter wasapproximately $69 million, an increase of approximately 50% over the same period last year. Our adjusted net income per diluted share was $1.04,a 47% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2016.     Net new business increased approximately 10% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. We had a record of $647 million of net new businessawards, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.3x of Service revenue, and this is despite unusually high cancellations of $132.6 million during thequarter. The addition of our new awards has resulted in our backlog increasing approximately 4% on a sequential basis and 20% year-over-year,finishing at approximately $3.5 billion.     We will not be including our Data Solutions segment in our reported new business awards and backlog due to the short-term nature of thesecontracts. The diversity of our new business awards continues to be consistent with previous quarters with approximately 60% of our new awardscoming from the pharmaceutical sector and approximately 40% coming from the biotechnology sector. Our client base also continues to be welldiversified with our top 5 clients representing approximately 37% of our total revenue for the quarter, with our largest client representingapproximately 9% of total revenue.     Our full year 2017 financial results continued a trend of consistent and strong growth. We reported solid revenue growth and improved our overalloperating margins. With our full year service revenues of approximately $1.9 billion, representing growth of approximately 23% on an actual andconstant currency basis. Revenue growth, excluding Symphony Health, was approximately 18% at actual rates and approximately 17% on constantcurrency basis.     During 2017, we made significant investments in our business and expanded our Service offerings. We believe that we've established a foundationthat will allow us to provide long-term sustainable growth. I believe we are well positioned to offer a wide variety of services to our clients. Ouracquisition of Symphony Health has gone very well and I am delighted with the performance. We look forward to the continued opportunities thatthis strategic acquisition will provide in the future.     During Q1 2018, we'll be formally finalizing our integration plan and will be working on completing integration by the end of 2018. Due to oursolid performance in 2017, we are anticipating our 2018 diluted adjusted earnings per share to be between $4 per share and $4.15 per share. Asdiscussed in our press release, this guidance includes the impact of adopting the new revenue standard, the impact of the enactment of the TaxCuts and Jobs Act and updated foreign exchange rates become estimates. Linda will provide additional details about our 2018 guidance later inthe call.     In closing, I would like to thank our entire staff and our clients for their continued commitment to PRA Health Sciences. We are delighted with ourstrong financial results, and believe we are well positioned for strong growth in 2018.

3,64388292,PRA HEALTH SCIENCES INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, PRAH",Q4 2017 PRA Health Sciences Inc Earnings Call,Linda Baddour,"PRA Health Sciences, Inc.","Executive VP, CFO, Corporate Secretary & Principal Accounting Officer",False,True,"Thank you, Colin. Good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2017, our consolidated service revenues grew 37.5% at actual foreign exchangerate and 35.9% on a constant currency basis. We reported $568.8 million of service revenue for the quarter compared to $413.6 million for the samequarter last year. As Colin mentioned earlier, PRA revenue, excluding Symphony Health, increased 20.2% year-over-year at actual foreign exchangerate and 18.6% on a constant currency basis.     Revenue by segment for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $497.3 million for the clinical research segment and $71.5 million for the data solutionssegment. Revenue concentrations, excluding our Data Solutions segment revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2017 was consistent with prior quarters.We derived approximately 56% of our Service revenue from large pharmaceutical companies, approximately 14% from the small-to-midsizepharmaceutical companies, approximately 16% from large biotechnology companies and approximately 14% from all other biotechnologycompanies.     Total direct costs were $368.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $274.4 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in directcosts was primarily related to an increase in labor-related costs in our Clinical Research segment as we continue to hire billable staff to support ourcurrent portfolio of studies and our future growth. Our Data Solutions segment reported $40.2 million of direct costs in the fourth quarter of 2017.Total direct costs were 64.9% of Service revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 66.3% in the same quarter last year. The decrease indirect costs as a percentage of Service revenue, is primarily due to the higher gross margins in our Data Solutions segment Service offeringscompared to our Clinical Research Service offerings. On a constant currency basis, total direct costs increased by $86.6 million year-over-year. Thisincrease in our cost base included an unfavorable foreign currency effect of $7.9 million when compared to 2016.     SG&A expenses were $92.2 million or 16.2% of Service revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 17% of Service revenue for the samequarter last year. A decrease in SG&A as a percentage of Service revenue, is related to our continued efforts to effectively leverage our selling andadministrative functions. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we incurred transaction-related expenses of $75.9 million, which were primarily relatedto changes in the fair value of earn-out liabilities associated with our acquisitions. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we also incurred $13 millionof transaction-related costs. These costs were primarily related to nonrecurring stock-based compensation expense, and the vesting of certainperformance-based options related to our November 2016 secondary offering.     Adjusted net income, which excludes...     (technical difficulty)     ...items whose fluctuation from period to period does not necessarily correspond to changes in our operating results, increased 49.9% year-over-yearto $68.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income per diluted share grew 46.5% to $1.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017compared to $0.71 per share in the same quarter last year.     For the 12 months ending 12/31/2017, our Consolidated Service revenues grew approximately 23% at actual foreign exchange rates on a constantcurrency basis. We finished the year with approximately $1.9 billion of Service revenues compared to $1.6 billion in the comparable prior year. PRArevenue, excluding Symphony Health, increased approximately 18% year-over-year at actual foreign exchange rates and approximately 17% on aconstant currency basis.     Cash provided by operations was $102.6 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2017, compared to cash provided by operations of $93.3million for the same period of 2016. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operations was $220.4 million compared to$160 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in operating cash flow was the result of an increase in our operational performance, reducedinterest payments and optimization of our working capital.     Our net days sales outstanding was 20 days at December 31, 2017, compared to 19 days at December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures were $22million for the fourth quarter compared to $7.5 million for the same period of 2016. Capital expenditures were $61.3 million for the 12 monthsended December 31, 2017 compared to $33.1 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016.     4     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and itsaffiliated companies. 100                The increase in our capital expenditures versus 2016 reflects our continued investment in information technology, enhancing our current facilitiesand expanding our infrastructure to support our growth. Our cash balance was $192.2 million at the end of fourth quarter, of which, $63.6 millionwas held by our foreign subs. Net debt outstanding, defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, 2017, was $1.16 billioncompared to $691.8 million at December 31, 2016. The overall increase in our net debt is attributable to borrowings related to our recent acquisitions.     During the fourth quarter of 2017, we were able to call and retire our senior notes, which will reduce our interest expense in 2018. In addition, inJanuary 2018, we entered into 2 new interest rate swaps in order to minimize our exposures of variable rate debt. Regarding the geographicconcentration of our revenue, 62% of our quarterly Service revenues were earned in North America. At December 31, 2017, 82% of our Servicerevenues were denominated in U.S. dollars and 63% of our total expenses were denominated in U.S. dollars, which is consistent with prior quartersand consistent with 2016 levels.     Our euro exposure continues to be naturally hedged. We currently do have exposure to movements in the GBP as approximately 1% of our revenueis denominated in GBP, while 6% of our expenses are denominated in GBP. We are currently working on ways to reduce this exposure.     Now let's turn our -- to our guidance for 2018. As discussed in our press release, effective January 1, we are adopting the provision for ASC 606.ASC 606 requires that we apply percentage of completion accounting to Service revenues, Reimbursement revenue and investigator grants as oneperformance obligation. The inclusion of reimbursable out-of-pocket costs and investigator fees in the calculation of revenue may create a timingdifference between the amount we are entitled to receive from our customers and the amount of revenue we recognize in our financial statements.The variability and magnitude of this timing difference compared to our current accounting is dependent on the progress of the Service portionof our project compared to the progress of the investigator fees, and the reimbursable out-of-pocket costs relative to the respective forecast costover the life of the project. Although the adoption of ASC 606 will have a material impact on our reported revenue, we do not expect the adoptionto have a material impact on our GAAP net income, adjusted net income or related earnings per share. Should actual results differ from our currentexpectations, we will update our future guidance.     We are estimating Service revenues between $2.84 billion and $2.95 billion representing, as reported, growth of 46% to 51% and constant currencygrowth of between 18% and 20%, excluding the impact of ASC 606. As Colin mentioned, we had unusually high cancellations in the fourth quarterof 2018, which were mainly due to one of our large pharma clients (inaudible) had been the drug development plans. Unfortunately, these studieswere due to start in the beginning of 2018 and had a negative impact on our revenue growth for the year. Despite these cancellations, we are stillprojecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 10% to 12%, excluding the impact of ASC 606. As Colin mentioned, our strong book-to-billduring 2017 has set us up nicely to deliver double-digit revenue growth in 2018. We are anticipating diluted GAAP earnings per share between$2.80 per share and $2.95 per share, and diluted adjusted earnings per share between $4 per share and $4.15 per share.     Our diluted earnings per share estimates $0.04 to $0.06 of benefit from reduced interest expense related to the retirement of our senior notes;$0.03 to $0.05 of additional depreciation expense due to increased levels of CapEx during 2016 and 2017; and a full year of Symphony Healthdepreciation; $0.03 to $0.05 of costs associated with anticipated investment to be made in Japan and China; and $0.08 to $0.12 of tax benefit as aresult of the changes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act offset by -- this is offset by $0.08 to $0.10 of unfavorable foreign exchange impact,primarily related to the GBP.     We anticipate our annual effective income tax rate will be approximately 24%, which incorporates the changes expected from the Tax Cuts andJobs Act, which was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our effective tax rate may differ from this estimate, if the geographic dispersion of ourpretax earnings change from what we have estimated or if there are changes in interpretation, analysis or if additional guidance is issued relatedto the Tax Cuts and Job Act.     Regarding Q1 2018 guidance, we are estimating Service revenues between $688 million and $708 million, representing as reported growth of 61%to 65%, constant currency growth of 28% to 30%, excluding the impact of ASC 606, and constant currency organic growth of 12% to 14%, excludingthe impact of ASC 606. We are anticipating diluted GAAP earnings per share between $0.49 and $0.55 per share and diluted adjusted earnings pershare between $0.81 and $0.86. Similar to our full year guidance, we are anticipating our annual effective income tax rate will be 24%. Consistentwith 2017, we are including Q1 guidance to ensure that expectations around sequential quarterly earnings growth are in line with our expectations.This guidance includes the impact of enhancing our staff to meet our current workload; an increase in depreciation expense as previously discussed;     5     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

Finally, our guidance assumes a euro exchange rate of $1.25 and a British pound exchange rate of 1.37. All other foreign currency exchange ratesare as of January 31, 2018. Our process for determining exchange rates is consistent with prior years, where we use several bank resources toevaluate expected rate movements for the next 12 months.

I'm wondering if you can provide any color around those.Were those studies that you had assigned some risk adjustment to as your practices typically do? And then broadening out a little bit, as you thinkabout potential M&A among your client base, how might you be able to protect yourself against some added volatility or heightened volatility, ifthis type of activity continues?"
6,64388292,PRA HEALTH SCIENCES INC,02/22/2018," 2:00PM, PRAH",Q4 2017 PRA Health Sciences Inc Earnings Call,Colin Shannon,"PRA Health Sciences, Inc.","Chairman, CEO & President",True,False,"Thank you, Dave. Obviously we're not immune to cancellations. But that's -- actually was more of a -- the client's -- during our reprioritization, wherethere were -- one was a change in the [current outcome] of the study that either -- whether it's regulatory or -- and as -- looks as if it'll be comingback later on in the year. We just don't know when. And we prudently have -- take as a cancellation. There was another one where we decided todo a different study within the portfolio and reprioritize. So that's changing again. It'll be coming back in the future. And we also saw a little bit uptrend. There was a few slippages as we were going through Q1. And so we wanted to deflect being -- but prudent in our forward-looking, particularlyin Q1, because we did expect a few other studies to be up and running much, much more quicker. So Dave, I think the best protection we can haveis continuing to have a well-diversified portfolio. We have got a significant number of clients. Typically, we have been fortunate enough that whenthings are slipping, other things are accelerating. It just seems that the last quarter things were all going in the one direction which was a lot moreon the negative side. And saying that, we felt very good about everything. Has allowed us to be careful in our hiring. And actually go through andaddress areas where we've got a little bit of overstaff and watching -- and go about pruning. So all in all, we've taken advantage of that situationand still delivering what we feel is very strong growth."

If I can ask one follow-up on one of the last points you made on staff, and how some of the slippage and cancellations might impact laborutilization. I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about continuing to hire to support your growth rate. Could you get a little more preciseabout hiring pace and levels of utilization? And how we should think about how quickly you're hiring in light of the fact that this creates a little bitof slack in utilization?     6     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

And normally, we're always hiring,but the way of hiring is just been changing a little because of our attrition rate. We -- we've tried to hire heads.

And so we try to obviously try -- look at the portfolios and try to make sure that for allof our key clients we get the right people in the right places at the right time.

We've had some cancellations and some projects waiting has given us an opportunity tojust reassess. We're still -- obviously got to hire for all the new studies coming onboard.

And what I was coming up with was an EBITDA margin under ASC 606 or something like 15% to 16% for the full yearwith that being materially lower in the first quarter, and then stepping up meaningfully through the year. I guess, a, is that the right way to look atit? And then if not, could you maybe help us out with kind of what you're thinking about for interest expense and some of the other below-the-lineitems, any other -- other expenses might be factored into the model that would help us triangulate better on the -- on what the EBITDA margin isgoing to look like?"

You had guided to$60 million at the midpoint. So obviously, pretty massive upside. My question is how sustainable is that in 2018? Should we model growth off thisspace for the fourth quarter of '18? Or maybe step-up our quarters throughout the year?

The best months are the last months of every quarter, and the best quarter is the fourth quarter of theyear. Obviously, we are very pleased that they are out performance. How sustainable is it? Well, you can't take full quarter and multiply by 4. That'sfor sure. It ramps up during the year. We tried date to that. That -- it was very seasonal. It's -- they -- our clients typically will [rewind] it most of thedata towards the end of a year. And you're not going to see at fourth quarter a performance at all the time. Obviously, as it's our first year of operatingwith them and we've got a reasonably good budget for going forward, but I -- it should ramp up pretty steadily throughout the year. And hopefully,we can see the same sort of impact in Q4 next year. But obviously, we're excited to see the prospect of that. And we're booking through ourintegration plans. We're going to see how we can help them even accelerate that over time. 2018, as we said, was always a year of -- as our turnaround,it was a little bit -- we saw a little bit maybe more tentative.

As we're rebuilding the models for and the PRA's traditional models.Then we are just working with all -- a number of different groups as we look through for opportunities. I mean this was never a synergistic cost-cutting,savings. This is always about synergies by creating new opportunities. And we can see that we can leverage a lot of our data analysts to help producemore consultancy types of revenues with like pharma and even biotech. We were looking to see how we can utilize our data better. We'll bestreamlining some of our data costs. We'll be utilizing a lot of their capability to actually save the whole company to make [extra] cost. So duringthe year, we'll be looking at these very stages. I obviously don't want to interfere with that earn-out, which is why we're going to be taking it a littlebit slowly during the year, and doing it in a much more deliberate fashion.
