I just want to kind of get a feel for how big the Tavern menu was in terms of being a driverversus off-premise and other drivers, and then how far you're willing to let that Tavern Double menu mix grow as you sort of balancethe traffic with loyalty metrics with the lighter check that comes with that."

We madethat choice deliberately, and continue to kind of focus on that. It's hard to parse the difference between Everyday Value as it showsup in off-premise versus dine-in, but there is no doubt that the off-premise occasion is the one that's growing the most rapidly. Isthat helpful?"

So certainly, again, not being certain which one is the trend and which is the upand down with regards to dine-in. So we were off about 0.5 point in dine-in traffic, more than offset by, obviously, our growth inon-premise. And for the first time, honestly, we saw our mall locations not do as well, our in-line and mall locations not do as wellas we had in the prior years. So certainly, that continues to be a relative drag on our business. So again, we've only got about 17%of our locations that are in that group.     7     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

And then just how do you think about the average check going forward? I mean clearly mix continues to be about 150,200 basis point drag, and now you're starting to take more pricing against that. Do you expect mix to start to turn more or start tocontribute sort of a meaningful portion of the comps as you move into '18?"

Constant,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.",CFO & Executive VP,False,True,"Yes, Greg, on the pricing, we had the unique circumstance this quarter where an annual price increase that we may typically take inJanuary, we instead took in October this year. So what you had in the fourth quarter was the benefit of the pricing we took lastJanuary, plus what we took in October. That will correct itself here in Q1. We won't be taking price this January, we just took it early.And so we would expect our pricing to be flat to up 1% as a rule of thumb going forward. So we're definitely not pricing to try andoffset the mix. In terms of the -- what we think about PPA and mix going forward, if the guests desire and the way we can drive value,as Denny said, is to allow the Tavern mix to extend, I think we're okay with that. I think as we talked about, affordability and valuesare very important component for us. So we're not necessarily trying to push hard to drive our PPA higher. We want to make surewe maintain affordability for the guest.

Peter, you'll recall that when we decided to pause thetraditional unit growth, those that were already, kind of, in the pipeline we had to continue on with. And we were able to stop thosethat were off further into the future. So the new unit spend will more consistently -- or most of it will occur in the front half of theyear.

And in the release, Peter, you'll see on what the 53rd weekbenefited us in the fourth quarter. It was $0.39 of EPS. As we look to Q1, one of the issues, as you consider modeling, is while there-- it's a 16-week quarter this year as it was last year. The first 2 weeks of the quarter last year were the week after Christmas and theweek after New Year's which are 2 of your highest volume weeks in the entire calendar year. This year, of course, because of the 53rdweek, took us through to the end of the calendar year. This year's first quarter will only have the week after New Year's in it. So whenyou're modeling, if you just use last year's Q1 base, you're probably overstating the absolute benefit as we move now into 2018."

And of course, there's somespeculation as to what the changes in the tax legislation will mean for individuals moving forward. But through that, we wouldn'twant to speculate how that's impacting us. In terms of geographies, we certainly look at those, and in the markets where we're mostpenetrated, Pacific Northwest, West Coast, Mountain states, we did very well. Some of our highest gaps to Black Box were in thosestates. The states, where we perhaps had a gap that wasn't quite as large are the states where we're much less penetrated, which Ithink potentially does say something to you as well.

I understand you were looking atsort of different ways of growing the business. But I'm just curious if there's anything new in your thinking along those lines? I knowyou're testing a store, but it just feels like you're looking at something new. And then the second question, more specifically, Guy,is the delta in returns from a low margin unit to high margin or a high return -- or a low return unit to a high return, other investmentsinto improving your store performance? I'm just curious of what the difference in the returns are, if you've seen those."

We're continuing to look at ways that we can address the rising labor costs and find new ways in our existing4-walls to help the guest. And so you'll hear a lot of that.

Constant,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.",CFO & Executive VP,False,True,"Yes, and maybe just to add to that before I answer your other question, Howard, we were leaning heavily into the technologyinvestment. We're in the process of expanding the technology capacity in our current restaurants. We're doing an upgrade to ourcurrent point-of-sale software and our food cost management system. We're putting catering software in our restaurants. We'regoing to put technology in the hands of our servers to improve their productivity, improve the guest experience. So we feel likeimproving those 4-wall economics, which does lead into your second question, is an important focus of ours. Rather than buildingnew 4 walls, we need to make the 4 walls that we've got operate much better. In terms of the delta between returns, I mean, I don'tknow that I'd want to get into the specifics, but we've got units, as you might imagine, that do north of 6 million in volume on anannual basis and we've got some that do 2 million. And so as you can imagine, the return profile is dramatically different betweenthose 2. As we think about refranchising the system, those factors enter in to our equation as we think about would we earn a betterreturn with those models being franchised as opposed to being company-owned. Which is why we set the goals around increasingour franchise mix. And of course, any of these initiatives we're working on to drive comp sales or invest in technology and improvelabor productivity will -- sort of will be the tide that lifts all the boats in the system. And so that's where we're focused on right now,improve the 4-wall economics. Doing better with the investments that you've already made is always going to provide a betterreturn than trying to search for new ideas to try and drive those returns as we move forward."

And I'm looking forsomebody to tell me exactly the number, but yes, we're limited by, I want to say maybe 60%. Curbside uptake, I think, is not as highas perhaps we had expected initially. Delivery is definitely the growing category. Third-party delivery is huge and growing rapidly.And for the fact that it's only in about half of our locations, it's over-representing right now in terms of growth.

So they embark, theytake advantage of getting more food but don't get the beverage. But curbside has not been the dramatic growth piece that weexpected. A lot of folks are still walking in. We're seeing about equal balance between online and call-center orders, and continueto see one of the largest components is folks just walking in to the restaurant, which is what we've been doing for years."

All the targets were hit. So I think there's a lot of momentum coming off of that. And we did-- we made those changes in a quarter, where our comp sales and our traffic were very strong. So I think that's building confidencein our operators that we can make these kinds of changes, and that we're making them with an eye towards making sure that theguest experience is at least as good, and in many cases, hopefully better than what we saw before. And getting momentum on thesekinds of changes and seeing that they can work and be a positive for the guest experience is helpful for us to get other changesdone in the future.

And then just one last one on that. Can you quantify, as you think about your labor outlook for 2018, can you quantify thelabor savings between the Maestro and other initiatives that are embedded in that guidance?

So call it 3 quarters of that benefit or $6 million of the improvement will come from Maestro.And for us to offset mid-single-digit inflation on our labor basket, we obviously need a lot more than the Maestro program in orderto get to that down 25 to up 25 on labor as a percent of revenues.

Just in terms of the quantification of the shift in the week. I think from what you've given us, the extraweek from 2017, there's probably 15% to 20% higher than a normal week, which if I do the math, sort of suggests the $5 millionmove from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. And so we should be like removing $5 million from the first quarter and then addingthat on to the fourth quarter. Is that roughly the right way we should be thinking about kind of the math there?"
