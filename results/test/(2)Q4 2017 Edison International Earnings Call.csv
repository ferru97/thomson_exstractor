1,64390267,EDISON INTERNATIONAL,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, EIX",Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call,Julien Patrick Dumoulin,Smith,"BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division",False,True,"I wanted to first follow up on the change in the parent drag. How are you thinking about mitigating this over time? I know you justare talking about kind of preliminary '18 guidance here and we're already asking you how you think about it into the future. Butobviously, it's a pretty meaningful move. Can you give us any thoughts on the breakdown of what exactly is in that approximatelyquarter of drag and how that evolves?"
2,64390267,EDISON INTERNATIONAL,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, EIX",Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call,Maria C. Rigatti,Edison International,Executive VP & CFO,False,True,"Sure. So I think in the past, we've said a penny and a half per month. I think this looks more like $0.02 per month, plus whateverEdison Energy is doing. Obviously, over time, the Edison Energy number is one that we are working towards a breakeven run rateby the end of 2019, so that will be part of the approach to minimize that drag. And at the holding company, tax reform has had animpact on us. While we believe that from a deductibility perspective, we'll be able to allocate that expense, the fact that we just hadless of a tax shield as a result of the lower tax rate is having an impact.     We always look at operating cost efficiencies from the conversation we just had, or the remarks that we just made that we actuallybenefit a little bit in the fourth quarter at the holding company from lower costs. That will be our approach, the same one we'veused at the balance of the company.     8     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

And I wanted to follow up on the dividend. Just in terms of the comfort level that the board obviously had in declaringthe latest dividend, how do you think about that evolving as you learn more about the potential exposures here? Maybe saiddifferently, with respect to the discrete test that you had to evaluate the latest dividend, how do you think about potential risks ofreevaluating that in subsequent quarters here?"
4,64390267,EDISON INTERNATIONAL,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, EIX",Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call,Pedro J. Pizarro,Edison International,"President, CEO & Director",False,True,"Julien, I'll take that. This is Pedro. I think like I said in my remarks, our board looked at a broad range of potential negative outcomeshere. I know that we're not putting out a specific estimates that we may have or the like, and I also recognize that a number of analystshave put out their own sets of ranges out there. But suffice it to say, we took a look at a good broad range of potential outcomeshere based on the information we have at hand and the board felt we're very comfortable making this quarterly dividend decision.     In the normal course, we always update you on dividend actions. We typically have talked about potential adjustments in annualdividend levels at the end of the year, but then we validate as a board and do actual board approval quarter-by-quarter. And that'sagain our normal course, and that remains our normal course. So a quarter from now, we'll be having the next discussion on thatquarterly dividend.     Again, we did look at a broad range of potential outcomes here, so there would have to be some very new information that thechanges that range of outcomes to affect the thinking further. I think that's about the best way that I can frame it at this point, Julian.Does that help?"

We're not commenting on causation and the like, but the board did take a look at that potential range of impactsfrom all these various events.     So I think we've taken a very diligent approach as directors at looking at a lot of ways in which under California regulations and lawthat could impact the company and felt very comfortable about the rigor behind the broad look that we took."

And I think you talked a bit about this in your prepared remarks. But just generally, as you thinkabout the cost and availability of fire insurance, I guess, really both for you, but more broadly for your customers and for others inthe region, we hear some concerns about areas becoming uninsurable or costs rising significantly. How do you see that evolving inCalifornia? And I guess relatedly, do you see a political awareness in the legislative body in terms of the need to be thinking aboutthis holistically?"

And I'll start this one and Maria or others may want to comment from the management team.     First of all, you have to date up this insurance forms that we purchased, as Maria described in her comments. I think it's safe to saythat's probably the most expensive premium we've paid for insurance ever. So that alone is a data point on -- there was availability,but at a much steeper cost than we've seen before. And as we continue to head into the market to secure different elements, differenttranches of our towers, we are continuing to see a very tight market.     But to your point on awareness, that's frankly part of our job right now, to make sure that we are making policymakers aware andwe're fully engaged on that. I mentioned in my remarks that we are engaged with the entire community of policymakers out there,from the governor's office, through to key legislators. We are doing a lot of that jointly with other utilities or other groups that are Ithink aware of the issues here across the state. And again, it's part of not just a utility issue, it's part of a statewide issue here that wethink the severity and the frequency of these fires continues to go the way it's gone over the last 3 years. It's going to continue toput added pressure on the insurance market and other parts of the economy. So we've taken it on ourselves to make sure that weare knocking on a whole lot of doors in Sacramento right now, making sure folks are aware and bringing some of our ideas to thetable of what reforms might be needed to solve this statewide issue.     Maria or Adam, anyone from General Counsel, anything you want to add?"

Rigatti,Edison International,Executive VP & CFO,False,True,"I'd just say I think it's something that the regulators really need to pay attention to. When we filed our GRC, people were veryappreciative of the $85 million in O&M costs that we had taken out of the system and this sort of insurance premium completelyswamps that. And it does get recovered in our General Rate Cases, we applied for that, so customers will ultimately bear very highcosts unless and until we can make people aware of the issue."

Just maybe one follow-up on physically as we think about your utility system. Is there a lot of co-location telecom equipmentwith your equipment? Or how do you broadly think about the degree to which there is that co-location of there of telecom equipmentwith yours?

Cal Fire is the lead fire investigation agency as they typically are in fires where they're actively involvedin suppression.

We wish we had more comfort on timing, we don't. These investigations historicallyhave taken anywhere between 12 and 18 months to complete.

And then in terms of your legal strategy out of the gate here in the court system, is there anything that you can tell us in thisearly stage that might make your strategy differ from some of your peers or differ from that engaged by PG&E in the Butte fire lastyear? I realize it's obviously still early there and you're probably limited in what you can say, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts."

It's very, very early. The investigation around cause has just commenced, so I think it really is premature tospeculate as to what the ultimate strategy will be. You will see, as we've seen in other large fires like this, an effort to coordinatebefore a single judge, the numerous lawsuits that are brought. And in fact, there is a motion to coordinate the various lawsuits thathave currently been brought in the Thomas fire. That's a procedural step to hopefully make the litigation more efficient, but that'sreally at the early stages as well. So not much more we can tell at this point."

Pizarro,Edison International,"President, CEO & Director",False,True,"Adam, maybe I would add and I totally agree with how you framed it and these things are really case-by-case, depending on thefacts in any given case. If you move up, though, to the 10,000-foot level, I think you're seeing indications that from a policy perspective,not from an individual, legal strategy from an individual case, but from a policy perspective, there's a lot of good discussion andcoordination with our other peer utilities in the state. And you've seen, as I mentioned in my comments, we joined with PG&E infiling the application for the hearing in the San Diego WEMA case. We filed an amicus in the PG&E Butte case. So I think there's arecognition that the broader themes around policy and moving beyond just inverse condemnation, that support for a number ofactions across the economy, across fire prevention and hardening infrastructure and costs and risk allocation, those are ones whereat that 10,000-foot level it's so important that we be aligned, and we are."

Just wantedto get a little bit more color on that, both from the legislative and legal side. What kind of timing are you thinking about in terms ofsolving inverse condemnation right now?"

Pizarro,Edison International,"President, CEO & Director",False,True,"Well, again, this is one where, I think, we can give you a sense of that will take time, but it's very hard to pin down, here's the calendaror here's facing high ends at this very early stage. But let's take it in pieces. There are legal strategies, and so those play themselvesout in individual cases. And I mentioned the Butte case with PG&E or the Round fire case where we made our filing, right? So there'sa track around each of those cases. There's a PUC regulatory track, right? And I don't think that we have a clarity yet in terms of thetiming for the PUC to consider the various applications for rehearing in that San Diego WEMA case or the PG&E WEMA case activitythere. So typical and I'm looking around at Ron Nichols here, but typical CPUC time lines, certainly, it can be in the many months toa couple of years sort of time frame.     Then finally, to the extent that legislative policy changes attract something that we're also looking at, that happens in cycles oflegislative sessions. And so we have a session that runs through later this year. It's a possibility of next year's session. So we -- I willtell you we are certainly advocating about the sense of urgency on this, and we would love to see traction in this legislative sessionon some of these key pieces, but it's still early days and that's not guaranteed. As I mentioned in my comments, the deadline for billshas passed, but you can still get changes in those vehicles. So there's always a possibility that as we continue to engage with legislators,we could see changes in the vehicles that are available already and bills that have been filed.     So that could be a this year thing or it might take longer to help build the momentum and build the case and it could extend intothe next legislative session.     So I'm sorry, I think I took a lot of airtime there to say it's too early to tell. But hopefully, it gives you some color around some of theother pathways."

So there's a lot out there, and we're going to stay flexible in terms of how we finance that, eitherat EIX or SCE, either with short-term debt or long-term debt. I think that's really all I was really trying to say right now."

In the SONGS settlement, you've asked for this adjustment of the calculation of the equityratio. Is the settlement contingent on the commission approving that aspect of it? Or what would happen if they decided therewasn't a case made for that particular element?     15     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

I think it's around $600 million. Sorry, I was just looking at some of the math here as we answer yourquestion, Ali. It's around there. It's a little bit -- you can't tie it down to any particular number like consistently just because it's a13-month average rolling calculation that we do. So it's in that ballpark."

And then, Pedro, as you mentioned, there are -- you have various forums and parts you're looking at trying to get someclarity closure, if you will, on inverse condemnation, et cetera. Is your sense that for full clarity to come, you need the Cal Fireinvestigation to first be complete, in their determination on causes? Is that sort of the critical part item? Or from the outside, howshould we be looking at and keeping track of -- to say, okay, this is a key element in some clarity on this process?     16     THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us     �2018 Thomson Reuters.

That's a good question. And I think my answer is     [Audio gap]     I was thinking about pieces, separate tracks, right? So there's a track around the Cal Fire investigation, to the Thomas fire and causationper se and then what standards will be applied in terms of liability and all of that. There's this broader track around -- the state hasan issue. It's a big issue. Part of the issue is this -- the concern about the application of inverse condemnation feasibility, so the issueis broader than that, as I mentioned earlier. And so we're really looking for a broader, statewide solution.     Now clearly, there's a connection between these, right? And so if we had a very speedy resolution, and I think that would be wishingfor a lot because we do expect this will take time. But let's say that we have clarity up front in terms of there's a bill that gets passednext month that resolves the application of inverse, well then it clearly would have some impact on -- once the Cal Fire investigationconcludes, that would have impact on the recourse it means we would have to get recoveries for damages.     But again, I don't think that there's a serial linkage where we have to wait for that Cal Fire investigation of the Thomas fire to concludein order to work the various other paths, regulatory, legislative paths to try and resolve the broader statewide issue. I do see this asfairly decoupled. Does that make sense, Ali?"

To just on that to clarify your opening remarks as well, you talked about the California state goals, et cetera. Are you gettingany conversations back to suggest that there is some recognition coming that, hey, to meet our ambitious climate change and othergoals, this issue is directly linked and impacting that?"
60,64390267,EDISON INTERNATIONAL,02/22/2018," 9:30PM, EIX",Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call,Pedro J. Pizarro,Edison International,"President, CEO & Director",False,True,"Without getting into specifics who said what, yes, I think there is that recognition. And a lot of it is driven by the goals and the mathbehind the goals. Let's just focus on the 40% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030. That goal alone, the state itself has looked at toolslike electrification of transportation, and building efficiency and renewables, requiring a strong grid, being a part of the solution, amajor part of the solution. I'm glad that we have completed our analysis that lead to our clean energy white paper in the fall becauseof that, quite frankly, sharpened our thinking in terms of what it will take for the states to get there. And so that said, with the state,if the state really wants to get us a 40% reduction and deliver the lowest possible cost for our customers, this is a whole lot of yearsfrom the smart, modern reliable grid that's needed to get 80% carbon-free resources and get 7 million electric vehicles and get abunch of water heaters and space heaters that are electric and so on. And so I think folks recognize that, but it is helpful that wehave voices like the Air Resources board who put out their plans. You have the governor upping state's objective to 5 million electricvehicles. We still stand by our math, which suggests that it's a cheaper path for the state. It's actually more like 7 million electricvehicles. And I think, Ali, we'll see that continue to surface in various venues. One that I will point to coming up here is the integratedresource planning process at the CPUC, which will use different scenarios and take a look at our long-term horizon for the resourcemix in California. And that I think will, once again, provide more proof points for the importance of healthy utilities."
