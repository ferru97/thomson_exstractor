2,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Michael L. Benstock,"Superior Uniform Group, Inc.","Thank you, Hala. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results. This quarter, we've provideda few supplemental slides to augment our remarks to better explain the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Andy will specificallyaddress during his remarks. We've also included a slide that outlines our updated expectations for our long-term top line growth guidance. Theseslides can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. As usual, I will begin by discussing key highlights for Q4 and 2017 and provide our thoughts on market trends. Next, Andy will provide more detailabout our financial performance, tax reform impact and accounting changes. Afterwards, I'll review our outlook and offer some general thoughtson the future. We will then be happy to take your questions. We had a strong finish to fiscal 2017 with the fourth quarter marking our 21st consecutive quarter of increasing year-over-year revenue. Fourthquarter consolidated net sales in 2017 increased 12% over the same quarter in 2016. For the entire year, consolidated sales were up 5.6%.     Additionally, earlier in the year, we acquired Public Identity, a small yet niche-oriented company, which provides us with an entr�e in collegiatelicense products. Both of these acquisitions are expected to be accretive to results in 2018. Tangerine and Public Identity have become true partners in supporting the BAMKO mission. Our Promotional Products segment has gained alarger geographic footprint, new market segment penetration, new product lines, expanded channel distribution and new customers. Themanagement teams of all of our companies have been meeting regularly to strategize and capitalize on cross-selling opportunities in other segmentsand using the benefits of our larger share organization. To give a couple of examples of where we have worked together to try to take care of all the synergistic benefits of our large organization, BAMKO,for instance, has been able to take advantage of our Arkansas warehousing facilities for their customers who want their products stored, stagedand distributed. As a result of having this capacity and capability, BAMKO and Tangerine are able to take on more business that would have beenout of their reach prior to being acquired by us. Public Identity has partnered with The Office Gurus using El Salvador outreach team to drive additional sales opportunities. BAMKO in India is gooddoing a good share of our customized Web development, which has already been rolled out for some of HPI's customers and has received veryfavorable results. This is just a few of the dozens of synergistic benefits that we're realizing from our current structure. Let's speak about The Office Gurus. The Office Gurus had an exceptionally strong quarter with revenues up 51.2% and reported a 61.2% increasein net sales to outside customers. The Office Gurus continues to broaden its footprint. And as we grow, we will expand the infrastructure ahead ofanticipated strong demand. In 2017, our call center in Belize added 150 seats. We have signed a lease on another facility in Belize, where our target is to add another 250 to 300agents. Because of our success at accelerating ourselves, we are also currently exploring the Caribbean, Central and South America to determinewhere to best place our next call center. By the end of the fiscal 2017, the total employee headcount in this segment was nearly 1,200. Segment growth has come from new customers as well as gaining deeper penetration into our existing base. The Office Gurus services our entireorganization as well, and we continue to leverage SG&A across segments and capitalize as much as we can on synergies and cross-selling opportunities. Shifting a little bit now to the macro environment. From our perspective and what many economists are saying, we can expect more inflationdriven by full employment, which will result in wage increases. And with that, we can expect to see higher employee turnover. Unemploymenthas been at or below 5% for more than a year as more people have returned to the job market and hiring has maintained momentum. Theunemployment rate is currently 4.1%. Some might call that full employment. Additionally, we believe uncertainty around health care should be behind us at this point as fully formed have not seen to be within reach andwe're seeing some uptick in activity. We also believe that with the tax benefits many companies were given, not only have bonuses been givenout, but we expect that there will be rebranding, upgrading of uniforms and more acquisitive activity. These all spell an increase in demand foruniforms and promotional products. As it gets harder to hire for entry-level call center positions in the U.S., we also see our call centers abroad benefiting greatly from the higher wagesand shortages here. To sum it up, we see the employment wage picture in the U.S. being very positive influence on our near future. I'll now turn the call over to Andy to review our financial highlights.",False,True

We filed our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 this morning. So I'll limit myreview to key income statement highlights for the quarter and fiscal year period. Let's begin by looking at fourth quarter highlights.     I'll now turn the call back to Michael for his closing remarks and a general outlook for the remainder of the year.",False,True
4,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Michael L. Benstock,"Superior Uniform Group, Inc.","As we talk about our strategy from future growth, we are very focused on all areas of our business, where we are not only leveraging synergies tosegment operations, but also strengthening our brand and marketing capabilities to create more integration where appropriate, with the abilityto leverage our installed customer base and capture increase cross-selling opportunities. We're making solid progress, creating a very broad anddeep organization that continues to serve a significantly larger customer base. Now if you'll refer to Slide 5, which, if you haven't found it, you willbe able to find it on our website under Investor Information. First, we'll discuss our uniform business and our updated long-term growth targets. In the past, we've provided revenue guidance for our uniformbusiness based on historical performance, which fluctuates up and down with rollouts, big wins and potential loss customers. This is the nature ofour business, and we do not believe the future will be much different from our history. From an organic standpoint, our compounded annual organic growth rate for the past 5-year period has been 8.1%. Our long-term target for ouruniform business is that we will grow organically at an average annual rate of 5%. Next, in our Promotional Products segment, 2017 is the first full year of net sales for this segment. In 2017, the segment generated organic growthof 15%. We have a target of average organic growth over the next 5-year period of approximately 12%. This reflects potential for customer overlapthat will happen as we continue to do additional acquisitions in this segment. Additionally, we will supplement organic growth in the segment aswe have said in the past with 1 to 2 additional acquisitions each year. Remote Staffing Solutions growth from 2012 to 2017, all organic, was a CAGR of 41%. We expect this segment to add approximately $7 million peryear on average for the next 5 years, yielding an average annual growth rate of approximately 23%. Lastly, on a consolidated basis, this should give us company-wide average organic sales growth of approximately 8.5% over the next 5 years. Ofcourse, we also intend to supplement this growth as we have said time and time again with additional acquisitions as they play a large part in ourstrategic growth. As I mentioned earlier, we expect BAMKO to continue to seek out strategic and accretive acquisitions. On the uniform side, we continue to nurtureour pipeline of acquisition candidates. As we have described in the past, they will likely be more sporadic than the promotional segment. In conclusion, we've had a strong year that positions us well for the future. A solid balance sheet and expected cash flows from operations enablesus to continue to preserve growth through acquisitions and other investments that leverage our strengths and are strategically aligned with ourcore business vision. We are executing well against our strategic plan that combines diversification and integration. Through acquisitions and organic growth, we area much broader, deeper and certainly, more valuable organization than we were just a few years ago. We will now open up the call for questions.",False,True
5,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Operator,NA!,(Operator Instructions) First question comes from Kevin Steinke with the Barrington Research.,True,False
6,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Kevin Mark Steinke,"Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to start out by asking about -- you've been talking in the last couple of quarters about uncertainty in the political environment, regulatoryenvironment, causing customers to hold back on spending a bit. And as you mentioned though, we've gotten clarity on tax reform, health carereform seems to be kind of in the rearview mirror or unlikely to change anytime soon. So are you starting to hear from your customers a greaterwillingness to spend? You mentioned seeing a bit of a pickup in activity, but I'd be interested in any more anecdotal evidence you're seeing out inthe marketplace on perhaps some increased spending plans.",True,False
7,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Michael L. Benstock,"Superior Uniform Group, Inc.","The sense I get is this, that, yes, tax and health, those aren't questions. But we saw the market a couple of weeks ago a little crazy. So certainly,investors look to -- are seeing some uncertainty out there. I don't see it. I think our customer base is extremely optimistic. Everybody realizes thatthere will be some wage inflation. So there is a lot of efforts being made from a technology standpoint to stem the need to have -- to hire a lot ofadditional people. But additional people isn't -- will drive us more than turnover will. And there will be turnover and higher wages will definitelycreate that. The full employment picture helps with that as well at this point. I'm feeling very good, and I think our customers are. I meet with eachof our presidents every single week. We have -- or today, I've met with a couple as well earlier in the week. And they're all feeling very optimistic.Their pipelines are as strong or stronger than they've ever been. As I said earlier in my remarks, maybe I didn't say it, we're having only bigger --more opportunities and bigger opportunities are coming our way. And when I say are coming our way, we're seeing RFPs. We're seeing -- peopleasking us to bid on certain things or just give them pricing, existing customers and new customers than we've seen in a long, long time. Morecustomers and bigger opportunity. We're a bigger company now, so maybe our view is that we can handle bigger opportunities as well now andwe're more open to that. So I think the future looks pretty good. I'm not concerned about inflation. Inflation, that will tend to work its way throughany organization without setting higher wages or suppliers having higher wages. Therefore, we're going to have to be passing price increases onto customers ultimately. A lot of our contracts, most of them allow us some latitude in that respect. And we've done a great job on the sourcingside of our business. So I'm not -- I feel we can offset whatever happens from an employee share standpoint by using the large organization nowto leverage our strength with our suppliers. So I'm not concerned at all. It's been a very -- pretty robust economy going on finally, and I see it onlygetting better.",True,False
8,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Kevin Mark Steinke,"Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just following up on that line of thought there, you had talked about in your prepared comments potential margin pressure fromwages, fabric, et cetera. But from what you're saying, it sounds like you can -- and pretty much handle that, pass on price increases. But at the sametime, it makes sense to explore other alternatives, new sourcing relationship or expanding in Haiti. I mean, so I guess, you're not feeling like, ""Hey,we can't handle the inflation out there, and we're going to continue forward kind of as we have been."" I mean, is that fair to say?",True,False
9,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Michael L. Benstock,"Superior Uniform Group, Inc.","That's a very fair statement, yes. And you also have to keep in mind, what we have that most of our competition doesn't have is we have quite alarge office in China with over 75 people who are managing relationships for BAMKO and now for Superior in many, many factories. We've got aterrific sourcing group here in Florida that doesn't spend much time in Florida, that's -- quite frankly, who spend most of the time traveling theworld. But the kind of hands-on sourcing that we do versus what other people does is a very, very different animal. And because we're there, Imean, we're not locked into a particular situation. In fact, I'd say, yes, a factory -- a mill might be having issues with compliance and it's have tospend money or shut down. But we're not just dealing with one mill. We've got so many sources there for textiles and for sewing our uniformproducts and for BAMKO producing their products. I worry less and less for us. I think it puts us to an advantage to our competition as opposed tootherwise.",True,False
10,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Kevin Mark Steinke,"Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. If I could just boil it down here. In terms of your business model as it is today and the improvements you're going to continue to make,the initiatives you have in place, do you feel like the business is well positioned to continue achieving some margin expansion in 2018 and growingthe operating income line faster than your sales?",True,False
11,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Michael L. Benstock,"Superior Uniform Group, Inc.","I'll take a stab at that and then I'll throw it over to Andy. The -- as we continue to use the synergistic benefits of all of our shared services within theorganization and cross-selling and everything else, from an operating margin standpoint, I'm fairly confident that we will be working really hardto improve that. On the other side, on the gross margin side of product margin, we could see some increase -- we could see some decreases in ourgross margin. But I'll let Andy -- he's modeled this out 25 different ways, and I'll let him jump in at this point.",True,False
12,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Andrew D. Demott,"Superior Uniform Group, Inc.","Yes. I mean, generally, we don't give a lot of guidance going forward. But what I will say on our -- from an operating margin perspective, you haveto be a little bit careful whenever you look in 2018 on a percentage basis, something we did do a nice acquisition on the promotional side right atthe end of the year, beginning of December. And as you know, our Promotional Products business does outrun at a lower operating margin todate. They are -- we do expect that margin will continue to improve as they grow. But with them being a larger portion of the mix, that could weighon the overall operating margin just a little bit. I don't think it will have a tremendous impact on it. I think that we continue to look at -- really, we'renot looking just at the gross margin. We're look at the operating margin together, and we still expect positive momentum in that area.",True,False
13,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Kevin Mark Steinke,"Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right, fair enough. The -- can you talk about -- in the quarter, specifically, I mean, gross margin was up, but also SG&A was up as a percentageof sales. Was that due to business mix as you generally talk about some business can have higher gross margin but also higher SG&A? Or what wasthe dynamic going on there in the quarter?",True,False
14,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Andrew D. Demott,"Superior Uniform Group, Inc.","Sure, on a consolidated basis, there were a couple of things. In last year's fourth quarter, we had a gain on a settlement. It was about just under$0.5 million. Obviously, that didn't repeat this year. And then in this year's fourth quarter, we're probably close to $300,000 of acquisition-relatedexpenses. So those items alone are about $800,000 of SG&A in the quarter. The other side of it is really just tied to a mix of customers. You saw thesignificant increase in the gross. There were some offsetting increase in the SG&A associated with servicing those accounts.",True,False
15,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Kevin Mark Steinke,"Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right, perfect. Could you just touch on the benefits you expect to see from integrating HPI and Superior I.D., I guess, both from a cost perspectiveas well as your ability to sell to the market?",True,False
16,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Michael L. Benstock,"Superior Uniform Group, Inc.","Sure. We've -- HPI has been driving our sales now for a couple of years. But since we purchased them, actually, for the markets that they serve --and we let our -- we just, on the Superior I.D. side, work towards maintaining the business we have. They -- 2 business operate with 2 presidents.They -- once that's combined, they'll be one. The 2 business operate on 2 IT platforms. When this is done, they will operate on one. Because of that,they operate essentially with 2 web platforms. We'll be able to operate with one. So a lot of the cost of IT and web development or the redundantcost will go away. And they operated 2 marketing departments. And just about -- mostly everything else is on a shared service basis. It will be a     much strong organization and a more efficient organization once they're put together. And that won't be completed -- finished in total, we'reexpecting, the end of first quarter 2019. Most of the work will get done this year, and a lot of the benefit we should see towards the end of the year.",True,False
17,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Kevin Mark Steinke,"Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Just -- could you just dig a little bit more into the 5-year growth targets that you issued there. Slight, slight tick down in the uniformside and the Promotional Products side, but a dramatic increase in the growth target, at least on an annual revenue added basis, for Remote Staffing.So can you just delve a little bit more into the thinking behind the tweaks to each of the 3 segments, which -- obviously, it still rolls up into basicallythe same organic growth on a consolidated basis you were targeting before, but just trying to dig into the 3 different elements there.",True,False
18,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Andrew D. Demott,"Superior Uniform Group, Inc.","Sure. I mean, first off, and let me clarify. It's not quite the same target. We were at 8% consolidated before. Now we're at 8.5%. I think when we lookat it, we're a much -- when we first started giving this guidance probably a couple of years ago, we weren't nearly as large as are today. So part ofthe impact is that we're a large organization, so it takes more dollars to get a higher percentage. Also, just looking at the uniform segment andkind of where it's been, we really felt more comfortable in that arena with the 5% number. I think it still got healthy target for what we're trying toget to. And I'll make sure -- Michael will probably add a little more color on that when I'm done. But on the promotional side, there, we -- again,we're, on a pro forma basis, at the end of this year, we're basically double the size we are right now. To try and continue to grow that at 15%, oneof the things we find as we buy these companies and we buy more. There will be a little more overlap on the customers that are there. So you won'tbe able to -- you may be cannibalizing a little bit of what would have been the organic growth. We feel very comfortable with that 12% numberon a go-forward basis. On The Office Gurus business there, I mean, we have had tremendous momentum with the change we made at the salesorganization a year ago as well as the -- quite honestly, a lot of us, the word-of-mouth and the positive impacts we've had on our existing customers.Many of our customers have grown tremendously with us. We're capable at this stage of being able to handle a lot more business in that area. Andwe're, quite honestly, we're turning some business away just to make sure that we're taking the right business and being -- what's the most profitablebusiness for us to handle as we go forward. And I mean, we feel -- again, we feel comfortable with that $7 million a year. And we're still giving thatone. I mean, that shows a percentage there. But obviously, the percentage growth is coming down because of the fact that, that organization --that level of growth each year is making that $7 million a smaller percentage. That's when you get down to that 23% over time.",True,False
19,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Kevin Mark Steinke,"Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right, that's helpful. So just want to ask a little bit about Tangerine. And how would you characterize their customer base in terms of theindustries they serve? I mean, is it -- do they have a strong mix of retail, consumer products? What's really the areas that they're strong in, in termsof that kind of POS and point-of-purchase offering that they have?",True,False
20,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Michael L. Benstock,"Superior Uniform Group, Inc.","Yes. Their primary customer are other businesses who are looking for point-of-sale display, the signage, for their businesses. And I just got backfrom the PPAI show not very long ago, about a month ago, where we had all of our different companies out there, probably one of the largestgroups out there. And I could tell you that their reputation is stellar when it comes to what they do and that they're considered a thought leaderand deal with some of the largest spirits companies in the country, doing much of their point-of-sale work. They still have a pretty diversifiedportfolio in -- below that or below the spirits is definitely an (inaudible) and a signage of point-of-sale is definitely an issue. Even though -- they dosome of the same traditional work that makes up a small part of what BAMKO, the company we bought about a year ago, does as well. And as theyall -- probably every acquisition we do, we'll have some niche or some strength that will also still -- 20% to 30% of their business will still be in thetraditional ad specialty work. We really created -- get for ourselves, if I can explain it. I wouldn't like to say we're a French player in the promotionalproducts that's going to (inaudible) we are one of the few companies who has the ability to customize and actually work with some of the bestbrands in the world on developing the unique promotional product for them and -- which makes us different. And that's what made BAMKOdifferent and that's what makes Tangerine different from the other 22,000 companies out there who are in the promotional products world. And     what we're finding is that as we're looking at other companies, even from an acquisition standpoint and just from a competitive standpoint is thatit really is a very strong selling point. There's not -- everybody wants what everybody else has. And we're finding that our customization capabilitiesare even greater than we can imagine compared to other people when we look at other acquisitions. And that everybody we look at would loveto have the same capabilities that we had. Look, at the end of the day, the standard mugs and cups and pens and drinkware and all that, my ownsense is that and what -- a lot of the smaller promotional companies were embedded to the Amazon effect because Amazon ultimately could figureout how to do that and how to screen print that and how to logo that and everything else. And -- but that's not really our business. That's the --our business is much more towards the customized side. And that's the side we prefer to stay on. A lot less risk, much higher barrier to entry, makesus much more unique when we're in front of a customer. And I can tell you, from a -- if you look at our customer list in that area, they think thatwe're unique as well. So does that answer your question?",True,False
21,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Kevin Mark Steinke,"Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, it does. That's helpful. Just a couple more here. But you mentioned some pressure on the indirect health care channel and some new strategiesthat you're going to try to implement there. Could you maybe delve into a little bit more what the strategic approach will be going forward?",True,False

So no, I'd have to leave it that we have some -- we have both some sales andmarketing strategies as well as product strategies that will help us reach the ultimate decision makers sooner. And with our strategies, we believethat we would -- they will not be able to walk away from a conversation with us. Doesn't mean they're going to buy from us, but they're going toat least be a lot more interested in what we have to say.",True,False

24,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Andrew D. Demott,"Superior Uniform Group, Inc.","We -- I don't believe we put it into our filings. I believe it was about $2.5 million. But again, they're only -- it was less than -- it was really just onemonth. And December is not typically one of your bigger months of the year. So you -- but we do have some pro forma information and the financialis showing what they would have been for the full year, and that was about $35 million.",True,False
25,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Kevin Mark Steinke,"Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. And just lastly then, with all the various puts and takes going into the tax rate, you've been running at kind of this mid to high 20s ratefor the last couple of years, excluding what just happened in the fourth quarter. So what do you think is a fair approximation for where your taxrate might average out post tax reform?",True,False
26,64389203,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Superior Uniform Group Inc Earnings Call,Michael L. Benstock,"Superior Uniform Group, Inc.","Sure. Look at this year's rate and we were at 39.4%. If you pull out the tax act and then also, let's pull out our excess benefit we get on our optionsand so ours will come back to that in a minute, our rate this year would have been about 30%. The benefit from those options and SARs was aboutanother 7.2%. That 7.2% is the one that we have no way of controlling. It's all timing of when people exercise options and SARs and they disqualifydispositions and we get to benefit from that. So when I look at it, without that number, when you look at next year's rate, that 30% number wouldprobably be between 22% and 24%, and then we'll get some benefit from the effects in options and SARs. Does that make sense?",True,False

29,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Thank you, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I am excited to report that we delivered a strong finish to 2017. Our fourth quarterfinancial results exceeded our expectations. We have made significant progress on our strategic priorities, and we are well positioned to deliverimproved growth in 2018 and to exit the year at a double-digit year-over-year revenue growth rate. Taking a quick look at our strong fourth quarter financial results. We delivered fourth quarter revenue of $40.1 million, which exceeded the highend of our guidance range. We delivered positive adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 million, which was well above our guidance range even after adjustingfor some onetime benefits in the quarter, which Kevin will detail later. We generated $4.2 million of positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter. We signed exciting new logo up-sell and renewal agreements with such notable brands and content providers as Adobe, AMC Entertainment,Burberry, Discover, Franklin Templeton Investments, Hudson's Bay, Hugo Boss, Le Figaro, McKesson, Schlumberger, Sky NewsAustralia, StarwoodHotels, Subway, Trinity Mirror and Yahoo Japan Corporation, among others. From a bookings perspective, overall, we had a very good fourth quarter, and I am pleased with how our sales organization performed. For theyear, we achieved double-digit annual bookings growth. Although this fell modestly short of the mid- to high-teens ACV bookings growth targetthat we had set at the start of the year, I'm very pleased with the sales team's performance and what we achieved during the year and in the fourthquarter especially. We would have been within our targeted range if we had closed the 7-figure deal, which we received a verbal commitment from the customer,but is taking longer to get through their deal execution process than expected. In addition, during the year, we made an intentional choice toincent our sales team to sign multiyear deals. This incentive is working. We signed 59 multiyear deals in the fourth quarter alone. By doing so, wehave increased our strategic importance with these customers, we are able to better plan and align on product road map, ensure healthier accountmanagement relationships and lock in multiple years of committed revenue, reducing annual renewal risk and reducing or eliminating, altogether,market and competitive risk until the final year of the contract. Many of our deals also include price escalators in the subsequent committed years of these contracts. We also saw, in Q4, increasing new opportunitiesacross geographies in use cases. And when we look at the state and quality of our pipeline and the productivity of our recent sales hires, we're veryencouraged by what we see. Retention rate is also a significant driver of future revenue growth, and we expect that it will become a tailwind in the second half of the comingyear as we lap the impact of the commodity pricing reset in our media business. As Kevin will describe, we remain on track with the guidance we'veprovided for the timing and impact of our media pricing reset and its impact on retention rates. All-in-all, we are confident that our sales momentumand improving retention will drive consistent double-digit revenue growth over time. We entered 2018 with strong market momentum, the best product portfolio in the history of the company and a better organized, better managedand more effective sales and marketing organization. I am pleased with how the team is performing. And I believe, we will do even better in 2018.I would like to share some additional specific reasons why I'm so optimistic about the business. First, in the media market, we have reached a critical referenceable mass of large OTT and SVOD offerings. You've heard us talk about a number ofsignificant rollouts in Japan and Asia-Pacific during 2017. These deployments are going very well. Several of these customers have already increasedsubstantially their investment with us to expand their offerings. And as we head into 2018, they are looking to spend even more with us. We are seeing that success begets success in this market. And we are focused in 2018 on leveraging what we've done in Japan and Asia-Pacificaround the world. These efforts will include the best practices that we've learned in utilizing our professional services team and industry expertsto engage with customers early in the process in their OTT plan design. Combining this approach with our market-leading and scalable platformofferings, provides a highly differentiated go-to-market model. We see a rapidly growing pipeline of OTT and SVOD opportunities, and we feelgood about our ability to win these customers.     A fourth reason why I am confident heading into 2018 is that, as excited as I am about our successes in the field and in continuing to developmarket-leading products, I am equally pleased with the commitment that I've seen across the company in ensuring that we execute and operateefficiently and profitably. We've instilled across the company a more rigorous process to identify and to decide upon investment opportunities. As demonstrated by our fourth quarter results and indeed by our second half results, we are laser-focused on achieving the financial targets thatwe set for ourselves and for our investors. As Kevin will review later, we will return to full year adjusted EBITDA profitability and to positive freecash flow in 2018, which is an important first step. We will continue our focus in this regard throughout the year. We've already commenced adetailed review of our cost structure to seek opportunities to drive future margin expansion, including, but not limited to, looking at ways to driveincreased efficiencies from our infrastructure as we grow. Our senior executives from our product, engineering and finance organizations are alldeeply involved in this process. We will also continue to look for ways to drive efficiencies across our operating expense structure in our organization so that we can increaseoperating leverage, while still driving accelerating product innovation and improved sales growth. I want to be clear that, along with acceleratinggrowth, enhancing our margin profile is a top strategic priority for the company. In summary, Brightcove ended 2017 with strong financial and operating results. We believe we have positioned the company for accelerating topline growth and profitability in 2018 and beyond. We are committed to executing on our strategy for the year and for delivering value for ourcustomers and shareholders. We are confident that our investments in our products and go-to-market teams will enable Brightcove to build uponour market leadership position. With that, let me turn the call over to Kevin to walk you through the numbers. Kevin?",False,True
30,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Kevin Rhodes,Brightcove Inc.,"Thank you, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. As Andy mentioned, we delivered a strong close to 2017, and we are setting up well for 2018. I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'll finish with our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2018. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $40.1 million, $300,000 above the high end of our guidance range. Breaking revenue down further,subscription and support revenue was $36.9 million, which was up from $36.1 million in the year-ago period. Professional services revenue was$3.2 million in the quarter and was up from $2.5 million in the year-ago quarter. On a geographic basis, we generated 58% of our revenue in the North America during the first (sic) [fourth] quarter and 42% internationally. Breakingdown international revenue a little bit more. Europe generated 16% of our revenue and Japan and Asia-Pac generated 26% of revenue during thequarter. Japan and Asia-Pac continue to be strong markets for us come as we won several more large deals during the quarter. From a vertical market perspective, our media business represented 54% of our revenue in the quarter and our enterprise business represented43% of our revenue, while volume business represented the remaining 3%. Let me now turn to the supplemental metrics we share on a quarterly basis. Our recurring dollar revenue retention rate in the fourth quarter was87%, which was below our target range of low- to mid-90s. However, as we noted earlier this year, we're working through a pricing reset andexpected our retention rates to be lower this year. We had a number of these contracts reset during the fourth quarter. We continue to expect thatthe full impact of the pricing reset will be between $10 million and $13 million, and it will conclude at the end of the first quarter. Our customer count at the end of the fourth quarter was 4,168, of which 2,167 were classified as premium customers. We were pleased with ournew customer acquisition activity during the quarter, with a net 54 new customer additions. Looking at ARPU. Within our premium customer base, our annualized revenue per premium customer was $73,000, which was up 3% year-over-yearand excludes our entry-level pricing for starter customers, which averaged $5,000 in annualized revenue.     these contracts. Bookings are an important part of our growth story. But ultimately, improved retention will be the biggest driver of consistentdouble-digit revenue growth we are driving towards. With that, I'll now take your questions. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.",False,True

32,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Jeffrey Parker Lane,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",It's actually Parker Lane in for Tom. I was just wondering if you could provide an update on the migration of your customer base to Dynamic Delivery.I think you said about 20% last time we spoke. And what kind of value your customers are seeing out of that solution as well as the level of investmentyou have to make to complete that process?,True,False
33,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Parker, thanks for joining us, and thanks for the question and good to hear from you. We're making progress. We are approaching about halfwaydone. We still have a lot of work to do. But it's proceeding very nicely. Customers are certainly seeing the benefits.",True,False
34,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Jeffrey Parker Lane,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Thanks. And then, Kevin, on the professional services side, obviously, you're indicating a little bit down on the growth rate there. So I'm wonderingif you can provide a little bit of color as to why that is and whether or not this is just exercising some conservative philosophy here before investingfor new customer growth.",True,False
35,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Kevin Rhodes,Brightcove Inc.,"Yes, sure. I mean, as we all know, we had some large service engagements last year related to some of those OTT deployments that we had. Thoseengagements have largely started to wind down. Of course, we've got a very good pipeline of OTT and SVOD opportunities. But as you canappreciate, those opportunities are a bit lumpy, unpredictable to forecast. And so at this point, we were a little bit more conservative in what ourrevenue guide would be until we actually ink those deals.",True,False

37,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Michael James Latimore,"Northland Capital Markets, Research Division",Just on the pricing restructuring of the top 100 media customers. Are you sort of 75% all the way through that at this point? And do you expect itto be 100% at the end of the March quarter?,True,False
38,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Well, thanks for joining us. Yes. As we indicated at the outset, we are on track. We expect to be done with the pricing -- media pricing reset for thetop customers by the end of Q1. We are right on schedule.",True,False
39,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Michael James Latimore,"Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Great. And then from a professional services gross margin standpoint, any general guidance there? Does that kind of improve? Or do you -- is thatstill some investments going on there for the customer?",True,False
40,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Kevin, why don't you take this one?",True,False
41,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Kevin Rhodes,Brightcove Inc.,"Sure. Yes, Mike, we are largely through some investments that we had made there on the services side for some of these large deals. As you canprobably appreciate, there is this services component, but then there is also subscription components for those 2. And we look at that as a blendeddeal of margin as opposed to one or the other. And so some of these did have investments, strategic investments with these customers on theservices side, but overall, we are pleased with the opportunity and the SVOD deals that we have overall. So I think in terms of like this year, we dothink we're going to get back to positive margins in services. We think that we still got a little more investment here in Q1, but not a lot. And then,certainly, less than what we had in Q4 and then should be positive in Q2 and beyond.",True,False
42,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Michael James Latimore,"Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then, I mean, the guidance implies that you're improving profitability or at least EBITDA throughout the year, is that largely tied toexpected revenue growth? Or do you expect to do some additional cost reductions?",True,False
43,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"So it's across the board. All of the elements play in. Certainly, as we described, we're excited about the results that we had in the second half of theyear. We feel we have some really good momentum. We are anticipating exiting the year with double-digit revenue growth. And so that certainlyplays a significant role. But as I also indicated, we are committed to looking at all aspects of our operating margin. We believe that there areopportunities there to gain efficiencies as we scale and continue to grow. So it's both sides of the equation and all aspects of it.",True,False

45,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Lee T. Krowl,"B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division","This is Lee Krowl filling in for Sameet. First, I wanted to touch a little more color on the contracts. Definitely a positive sign that customers are signingmultiyear deals. But, I guess, generally, longer deals require some sort of concession. So I was curious since you did mention there is price ratchet,is there any sort of sweetener or discount you guys offer in the front part of the terms in order to get them to sign these longer-term price ratchetingdeals? Any color there would be helpful.",True,False
46,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Sure. Thanks for joining the call and for the interest and for your question. Each deal is different. We view it as a whole. As a typical measure, wewon't be discounting the first year, but we certainly try wherever possible to get as much of a commitment as we can out of the totality of thecontract. Yes, I probably should share with you, there is a lot of value in these multiyear contracts that go beyond just the commitment. Certainly,the additional years help build our backlog, and our backlog did grow year-over-year in excess of 14%, and you'll see that when our K is filed in afew days. In addition, having the customers locked in for a longer period of time or I should say committed for a longer period of time, really enablesus to focus a number of different things. Number one, we can focus the account management dynamic and dialogue on ensuring the customersuccess rather than be caught in an annual cycle of having a renewal negotiation. And that's really valuable. Second, with a longer-term commitment,we're able to really reliably and confidently plan a product road map based upon what that customers' initiatives are. And so those are all reallygood things for us in helping operate the business.",True,False
47,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Lee T. Krowl,"B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just kind of talking about the enterprise, the mix of enterprise in media customers. In your opening remarks you kind of mentionedwhat I would it take to be primarily enterprise customers. So as we see growth throughout the year, should we expect more growth from theenterprise side, just given your ongoing traction? Or how do we think about kind of a customer growth in terms of media versus enterprisethroughout 2018?",True,False
48,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Sure. So we look at it holistically, of course, and we are interested in growth across the board. We are very excited about the enterprise space, andwe've had some real success and some excitement about our enterprise offerings. The media business is also growing quite nicely. And so we'vegot different areas of the world where different dynamics are playing out in different growth rates. And so, for example, we're seeing wonderfulexcitement and adoption for our media products in the JPac region. In North America, we're seeing great excitement and a lot of adoption, a newlogo adoption in particular on the enterprise side. And so we're excited about all of it.",True,False
49,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Lee T. Krowl,"B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just the last one for me. You guys mentioned one of the biggest opportunities in terms of cost savings is likely to come from theinfrastructure side. Is that to the extent that you guys can talk about it, is it contemplated into guidance that you guys will be driving savingsthrough infrastructure in 2018? Or is there possibility for outside to the current outlook if you guys are able to drive or maybe find more opportunitiesto cut costs in infrastructure?",True,False
50,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Kevin, I'll let you handle that.",True,False
51,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Yes, I think -- I mean, our guidance contemplates everything that we can think of and reasonably forecast today. Of course, we'll be looking at areasacross the organization and certainly the infrastructure costs or the ability -- or the COGS, right, to deliver our service is certainly one of those areaswe will continue to focus on and try and drive costs out there and potential margin improvement in the future. So it's all baked in there.",True,False
52,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"We do believe that there are opportunities to exceed and overachieve on our plan, but we have to identify them and do the work. And so we'renot forecasting them yet.",True,False

And I know it's going to bounce around this year or in '17 because of the mediarepricing. Maybe could you give me some insight as to whether that was really the primary factor in Q4 that caused it to come in below normal?Or were there also maybe some smaller customers that didn't renew that contributed to that number?,True,False

57,64390012,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brightcove Inc Earnings Call,Andrew W. Feinberg,Brightcove Inc.,"Sure. A couple of different things. Number one, Q4 is one of our largest quarters. In fact, it is our largest quarter, and so more was up for renewal.And so there was a more pronounced impact and that played an effect here. And yes, each quarter is a different mix of deals because you've gotdifferent customers and contracts up. And so we did a little better than we thought and in some prior quarters.

Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining to hear about our fourth quarter results. I am happy to share with you another quarterof continued improvement, in fact our highest sales and profit quarter since Integer was formed 2.5 years ago. But before we get into the resultsof the quarter, I want to start by thanking all of our Integer associates for delivering another quarter of strong top line and net income growth andcontinued strong cash flow. The teams and the manufacturing plants and everyone supporting them delivered not only strong fourth quarterresults but a strong 2017 as well. The positive trajectory is clear. Thank you. Now let's review our fourth quarter results. Our fourth quarter results demonstrate strong revenue growth of 8% and net income growth of 28%.We've continued to generate strong cash flow from operations and paid down $129 million of debt during 2017. Gary will take you through the     financials, but I want to highlight that we finished the year above our original guidance on sales and at the high end on EPS. We understand ourcredibility with our customers is based on delivering on our commitments and it is no different with our investors. Today, we introduced our new strategy to drive accelerated sales and profit growth. Late last year, we completed a comprehensive strategic reviewof all aspects of our business and developed our new strategy, which is focused on portfolio management and operational excellence. Withinportfolio management, we organized our product lines into 3 groups, which are Invest to Grow, Protect & Preserve, and Improve Profitability. I'llcover our strategy in more detail later in the presentation. Turning to Slide 6. Annual sales growth consistently improved throughout 2017, and we closed the year with organic growth of 5% for 2017,reflecting the progress we have made to change the trajectory of our sales back to growth. Every product line improved their trajectory, eithergoing from a decline in 2016 to growth in 2017 or slowing the rate of decline. 2017 was an inflection point for Integer back to growth. Gary will now provide more discussion regarding our financial results for the quarter and the full year.",False,True
72,64390014,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Integer Holdings Corp Earnings Call,Gary J. Haire,Integer Holdings Corporation,"Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon. I'm going to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results, and I will also take youthrough our 2018 full year outlook. Consistent with prior quarters, any reference to organic when we are referring to sales excludes the impact offoreign exchange and M&A activity. Any reference to organic as we talk about adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS excludesthe impact of foreign currency gains and losses that are reported in nonoperating other income or expense. Turning to Slide 8. Here's a quick look at our results for the fourth quarter. Sales increased 7.6% organically, closing out the year with record salesin our fourth quarter. In the quarter, we saw growth accelerate in all of our Medical product lines and continued double-digit growth in ourElectrochem business. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% year-over-year. And during the quarter, we incurred just under $1 million of losses due toforeign exchange impacted by the continued strengthening of the euro versus the dollar. However, the impact is lower this quarter due torestructuring actions we took to reduce our exposure. Excluding this FX impact and taking into account the foreign exchange gain in last year'snumber, which was $3 million, adjusted EBITDA would have been up nearly 17% year-over-year. Our adjusted net income increased 28% organicallywhen you exclude the impact of the FX losses I just mentioned. Adjusted EPS was $0.96 on a reported basis and includes $0.02 related to the FX.And also worth noting is that our EPS was impacted by about $0.04 from share dilution year-over-year for a total of about $0.06 from these 2 items.Overall, we had a really strong finish to the year with solid execution. Now moving to Slide 9. You could see that fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income and EPS all had double-digit growth year-over-yearon an organic basis. Organically, adjusted EBITDA increased 17% year-over-year in the quarter. This can be attributed to our stronger sales volumesas well as improved gross margin, which is -- which was up a full percentage point versus last year. Organic growth was up 28% for adjusted netincome and up 24% for adjusted EPS. This growth included unfavorable year-over-year impact of higher incentive compensation, which amountedto about $11 million versus last year's Q4. These higher costs were driven by our stronger performance as we finished the year. On Slide 10, I want to summarize our full year 2017 results. Looking at sales, we had a strong year with 5.3% organic growth. This was led by theElectrochem business growing almost 37% as well as organic growth of 9% in Cardio & Vascular and almost 6% growth in AS&O. This was partiallyoffset by the decline of about 2% in Cardiac & Neuro. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% organically, which excludes the impact of FX year-over-year.Impacting adjusted EBITDA for the year was a headwind of approximately $14 million of bonus expense or nonstock incentive compensation giventhe improved performance versus the prior year and the company meeting its operating metrics. Adjusted net income was up 23% organically,which is driven by the improved operating performance, lower interest expense and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, which was about 20% in2017 versus 23% in 2016. Now looking at Slide 11. I want to compare our actual results versus our original guidance that was provided at the beginning of 2017. For sales,as we have discussed, we were well above our original guidance range, driven by stronger sales than we expected in both the Medical andNon-Medical business with the combination of better execution across the business and better-than-expected markets, specifically in Electrochem.     and electrophysiology. In addition, we are innovating in areas such as developing faster prototyping turnaround capabilities with the goal ofaccelerating our customers' speed to market and overall success. Looking at Slide 17. Sales in the fourth quarter for Cardiac & Neuromodulation stabilized during the quarter. For CRM, the market's remained flat.However, our customers experienced a nice return to growth in the quarter. In neuromodulation, sales remained strong, and these products andour customers continue to gain strength in the market. The rolling 4-quarter sales trend further reflects the stabilization we saw in the fourthquarter. We expect to return to growth in the first half of 2018 as midyear 2017 supply constraints have been resolved and customer activitycontinues to improve. The neuromodulation market remains a key driver of long-term growth for the product line. There are many opportunitiesfor continued growth. As the market-leading medical device outsourcer, we are focused on accelerating neuromodulation sales through the activesupport of customers of all sizes and the design, development and manufacture of everything from components to full systems for customerapplications. We continue to execute on our strategy in cardiac rhythm management and neuro, partnering with customers to provide full componentdesign, development and manufacturing capability that enables success and support growth. We also believe our OEM partners and customersare seeking more comprehensive, value-added solutions and supply chain efficiencies, which Integer is well positioned to provide. Now on Electrochem. Electrochem delivered another strong quarter of growth on a year-over-year basis, up 30% in the quarter, which translatesinto 37% for the year. The product line continued to benefit from a recovering energy market as well as share gains made during the downturn.Electrochem's outlook for 2018 is positive as the team executes on new business wins and continues to drive share growth and share gain initiatives.However, we do not expect the same level of high year-over-year growth rates as the energy markets have reached the point of stabilization. I will now turn the call back to Joe.",False,True
73,64390014,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Integer Holdings Corp Earnings Call,Joseph W. Dziedzic,Integer Holdings Corporation,"Before we get into the specifics of our updated strategy, I want to provide a little background on the strategic review process we went throughlast year. Shortly after becoming interim CEO, I initiated a very structured, 3-step process to assess the strategy that was in place and determineour go-forward strategy. The 3 steps were very straightforward. The first step was an external assessment of the markets we serve. This includedevaluations of the market size, growth rates, customers, competitors, technology trends, outsourcing trends and market share of the variousparticipants. We developed an objective view of the markets we are competing in to determine what to expect from those markets. The second step was internally focused on Integer. This step was designed to answer the simple question, what is our strategy and is it working?We've reviewed the results of our current strategy to understand our revenue growth rates versus the market, our profitability versus our competitors,our share of wallet with our customers, our technology position and many other success measures. The result of this review, combined with Step1, shaped our new strategy. So the final step produced what you see on Slide 20. The knowledge we gained and conclusions drawn from the external and internal assessmentsformed the basis of this strategy. The left-side groups are product lines into 3 categories: Invest to Grow, Protect & Preserve, and Improve Profitability.The importance of understanding these groupings is clear, what should we expect from the markets we're in given how we are positioned in them,which then leads to very product line specific strategies that enable us to win. The investor growth category includes Cardio & Vascular,Neuromodulation and Electrochem. These markets have inherent tailwinds and are expanding. Our customers are innovating to develop newtreatments and procedures that grow these markets beyond the existing products. These are markets that should yield higher-growth rates, andwe need to invest accordingly. The Protect & Preserve category consists of cardiac rhythm management, which is in a low growth end of market. Our Greatbatch-branded producthas been and continues to be a strong and well-positioned player in this space. We have and continued to innovate for the next generation of CRMproducts to enable our customers to improve patients' lives globally. The Improve Profitability category contains businesses with potential -- with growth potential and includes Orthopedics, Advanced Surgical andPortable Medical. These are strong businesses with differentiated capability that serve our customers very effectively, and they have significantmargin expansion potential.     positive impact he has had on our company. I have enjoyed learning from and partnering with Jeremy over the past 11 months, and I look forwardto his continued partnership. As part of Jeremy transitioning into retirement at year-end, we are moving the Cardio & Vascular and the CardiacRhythm Management & Neuromodulation businesses to report directly to me. This would create capacity for Jeremy to focus on 2 importantelements of our strategy, which are improving the profitability of the Advanced Surgical and Orthopedic business and leading our customerstrategic imperatives. Our new President of the Cardio & Vascular business is Payman Khales, who joined us this week and brings a strong commercial and generalmanagement background to Integer. I am confident Payman is the right person to lead our Cardio & Vascular business as we work to acceleratethe cardiovascular business to double-digit growth. I want to take a moment to thank John Harris, who has been leading the cardiovascular businessas Interim President very well for more than a year. I am grateful for John's leadership and the progress that cardiovascular business made underhis guidance. John is staying with the company in his prior role of Vice President of Operations for Cardio & Vascular, and he will be a vitally importantpartner with Payman. Kirk Thor joined Integer at the beginning of the year as the Chief Human Resources Officer. Kirk brings more than 25 years of talent managementand leadership development expertise, and I look forward to partnering with Kirk to drive our culture of strategic imperatives. The right-hand side of this slide highlights the executive leaders who are leading the strategic imperatives. I've already mentioned that Jeremy isleading customer strategic imperatives and Kirk is leading the culture strategic imperatives. The manufacturing excellence strategic imperative isbeing led by Jennifer Bolt. Prior to the acquisition of Lake Region, Jennifer led operational excellence for Greatbatch and brings a deep manufacturingbackground in the automotive industry. Business process excellence is being co-led by our Executive Vice President of Quality and Regulatory, JoeFlanagan; and our Chief Information Officer, Mary Holler. Both Joe and Mary have deep expertise in process excellence that positions them well tolead this important strategic imperative across Integer. We have a clear strategy to accelerate growth, both from a portfolio perspective and an operational perspective. The strategic imperatives areclear. We have the management team in place with the recent additions of Kirk and Payman. We have clear executive ownership of the strategicimperatives. More importantly, the executive leaders have deep domain expertise in the strategic imperatives they are leading. We have clearfinancial measures of success: sales growth above the market and profit growth at least 2x sales growth, which we believe will earn a valuationpremium. I am confident we have the right strategy and the right team in place to deliver for our customers and to realize our vision of enhancingpatients' lives worldwide. Joey, let's open it up for questions.",False,True

75,64390014,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Integer Holdings Corp Earnings Call,Matthew Ian Mishan,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess, first off, congratulations on presenting a very thorough and a really well-thought-out plan to grow the business. Have you had the opportunityto present this to some of your customers? And I just wanted to get their first reaction to it.",True,False

Dziedzic,Integer Holdings Corporation,"We -- I will have the chance to do that on Tuesday of next week when I'm meeting with a customer. We have just unveiled this publicly today. We'vebeen working on this, obviously, since the middle of last year internally. We've been rolling this out over the past couple of weeks. So this is thefirst public announcement of this. So next week, on Tuesday, I'll be with a customer and I'll get some initial impressions.",True,False
77,64390014,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Integer Holdings Corp Earnings Call,Matthew Ian Mishan,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the last slide, you put clear objectives over there, and the objectives are to grow faster than the market and to earn a valuationpremium. What is your sense of what the market is now growing at? What has it been growing at? And then who are you trying to earn a valuationpremium to?",True,False
78,64390014,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Integer Holdings Corp Earnings Call,Joseph W. Dziedzic,Integer Holdings Corporation,"Great question. So we think the markets, when you look at all of the markets that we're competing in and you aggregate them, we think it'smid-single digits, maybe somewhere in the 4% to 5% range. And we're looking at this and thinking about it over a long time period, not a discretequarter or year. So as we think about over time, we're thinking 4% to 5% is the market. So we aspire to be excellent, which is above the market,above average. And when we think about earning a valuation premium, there's not a lot of clear MDO public company comps. So as we look atcompanies that we think might be similar to us on other factors, whether it's size or being in the industry but not the specific markets or we lookat other deals that have occurred and we look at the value, we think market for us is somewhere in the low to mid-teens in terms of multiple ofEBITDA. We're trading at a discount to that today, and our objective is to earn a premium. We believe if we deliver above-market growth and webring profit through at least 2x the revenue growth that, that will earn a premium.",True,False
79,64390014,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Integer Holdings Corp Earnings Call,Matthew Ian Mishan,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then how much visibility do you have to growth? I mean, do you have any idea of how much is -- of the plan of the 2% to 5% next year, howmuch of that is new business wins or core volumes? And have you better aligned with your customers so that you're able to plan alongside them?Better so than you had over like the previous several years.",True,False
80,64390014,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Integer Holdings Corp Earnings Call,Joseph W. Dziedzic,Integer Holdings Corporation,"So if your question is more about short-term understanding our customers' needs and their volume demands, I think we've made tremendousprogress in the past couple of years. And I'll specifically point to what Jeremy Friedman, our COO, has done in building that process out to workwith customers for our sales and operations planning process. I think we're well aligned with our customers and we understand their near-termneeds from a production and delivery perspective. And I think we delivered very effectively in the fourth quarter, and that was part of our successin the fourth quarter. What you may be asking more of is as we look beyond 2018 and how do we earn an above-market growth rate, that's whereour strategic imperatives for customers comes into play. The sales force excellence is about us making sure that we're getting full value for whatwe currently have in terms of technology, manufacturing capability and how we can support our customers' growth. I think what we have todayshould allow us to grow at, at least the market rate, which we did in 2017. Looking backwards over time, we have it, but I think 2017, we are andwe expect to figure that out going forward to grow at least the market rate. And I think sales force excellence can get us there. The market-focusedinnovation is how we get to grow above the market, above what the market rate is by partnering with our customers and bringing innovativeproducts and solutions with them -- or to them. Jeremy is going to spend the rest of 2018 focused on these 2 strategic imperatives to ensure thatas we go into 2019, we have clear line of sight as to how we're going to deliver above-market growth.",True,False

On -- how should we -- maybe I missed it in the presentation, but how should we be thinking aboutinterest expense in 2018, especially in a kind of a rising rate environment?",True,False
82,64390014,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Integer Holdings Corp Earnings Call,Gary J. Haire,Integer Holdings Corporation,"Yes. It's a great question, Matt. So from an interest expense standpoint -- and I'll just stay to the cash side, the amortization of the deferred cost isgoing to be flat. It's around $7 million. But the cash side interest, we earned about $96 million of cash interest in 2017. And as we look forward, weexpect the cash interest to be down just a little bit. And really, it's -- if you think about it as we have, obviously, heavy debt paydown. So we havea lower balance. But certainly, the LIBOR is up. Right now, what we're modeling is about kind of a weighted average rate up around 40 basis pointsyear-over-year due to the LIBOR increases. And that's -- so that's the way I would look at it.",True,False

We absolutely did see stronger demand from customers in the fourth quarter than what we were anticipating. There's-- I'd say there were multiple factors that led to our outperformance in the fourth quarter versus our guidance, and it started with we executed. Wefulfilled everything our customer ordered and what they needed. The customer demand was stronger. You see the stronger revenues in theirresults based on their releases. And as we were entering the fourth quarter, we were looking at 2016, and the fourth quarter of 2016 was by far thebiggest quarter of the year. And so as we were looking at our fourth quarter 2017 demand, to think that we were going to be 8% over the highestquarter of '16 was not what we were expecting, obviously, given our guidance. So we did perform better in terms of delivery in the fourth quarter,and our customer demand was better. So we feel really good about entering 2018 with the momentum we have.",True,False

We have to go execute and deliver for our customers, which we're working on. Sowe're not giving up on growth in CRM but we recognize the realities of that market.

It sounds like you're going to pay a little bit less debt in 2018 than you did in 2017even though EPS should be greater. Is there a reason for that? Is that cash being used for investments? Or what's going on there?,True,False
93,64390014,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Integer Holdings Corp Earnings Call,Gary J. Haire,Integer Holdings Corporation,"Yes. Jim, it's Gary. So I think that what you're seeing is $100 million plus on the debt paydown. I don't know that I'd directly interpret that as we'regoing to pay down less. We generated really solid cash flow in 2017. On top of the cash flow that we generated operationally or free cash flow in2017, we had a couple other things that went to the debt payment, which was one, we effectively used a little bit more cash to draw our cashbalance down, which we think is a prudent thing and we'll continue to do. And also, we got some cash in from stock option exercises probablymore than a normal rate during this last year. So we had that excess cash. But I don't know that I would interpret it as we're going to reduce ourdebt paydown from '17 to '18. Maybe it's just I'm not giving specific guidance around it just for some flexibility, but I wouldn't say that it's a changein the investments. That level should be pretty comparable, as I said, on the capital investments. But I don't think you should read too much intothat.",True,False

For those of you that wish to stay, we will now turn tothe management presentation, followed by a question-and-answer session. So this is my portion. We will have subsequent reports by members of our management team. You can follow along, as I mentioned previously,through the website or through the webcast. Initial item that we're going to be discussing are our ongoing corporate objectives, and they are asfollows: continued growth in optics revenue through organic growth and opportunistic acquisitions; conversion of jobs shop revenue streamacross our optics companies to more predictable longer-term recurring revenue; a launch of a new business for us, called the HEAR IR business in2018; launch of an optical assembly business also in 2018; third, developed technology and transfer into commercial development. This includesRMD simulator technology, CLYC, Cesium iodide thin film simulation, strontium iodide and a new instrument that we developed within RMD, calledhandheld radiation monitor. And secondly, Dynasil Biomedical, the Xcede Patch, and the intellectual property around the Xcede Patch; fourth,maintain conformity with loan covenants, improve overall cost of capital through conversion to lower-cost funding where possible; fifth, capitalallocation to support the above objectives; and finally, sixth, focus on shareholder returns. The next slide is a brief summary of 2017 versus 2016. Revenue decreased from $43.4 million to $37.3 million. Optics revenue was the primaryreason for the decrease, which went from $23.7 million to $19.3 million. There was essentially one customer, and we will talk about that a little bitlater in the presentation. Contract research revenue decreased 9% from $19.8 million to $18 million, and we'll also have a brief description of that.Net income from operations pre-Xcede, up $1,800 and $15,000 versus $2.749 million in 2016, a decrease of 70%, net loss from operations versusnet income from operations of 582,000 versus 2016 of $679,000. Now a brief summary of our fiscal year 2017 performance. At EMF, revenue growth of HUD, Heads Up Display business. Our Hilger subsidiarycontinued support for Caesium iodide and lysine product development. Hilger was the entity that had a single largest loss as a result of the largestcustomer for the year not ordering product. Happy to say that, that business has returned for 2018. RMD, significant impact from the change in presidential administration to resulting in funding issues on approved projects. Staff reductions, salaryrollbacks and various other activities took place between the period of April to July 2017. And I'm also happy to say that our backlog route of $37million during the year, and ended at $33 million at the end of the year. We also had significant growth in our commercial revenue, which -- andwe're continuing to refine the commercial product pipeline, and you will hear a little bit about that during Kanai's report. On our Xcede effort, we transferred Xcede to -- we attempted to transfer the Xcede investment to the Dynasil shareholders via a stock dividend.We were unsuccessful in completing this. However, we did manage to -- through a combination of funding by Cook Biotech and Dynasil insertadditional capital into Xcede, and we will have a brief discussion later by Linda on where we currently stand on our first significant clinical trialsand product development. With respect to our corporate activities, we launched 3 e-commerce websites, which are up and running as of the end of the year, with another 1launched in early part of fiscal 2018. Total debt, maybe the last year we show this slide, but it shows that over the course of the last 4, 5 years, we've significantly reduced our total debt.It's gone from $11.5 million down to $3 million. Early on, in that period, we had some substantive issues with debt, and we've managed to reduceit down to a sustainable and manageable level, and we continue to anticipate that we will manage this closely -- year in and year out. Where wecan, we swap debt for lower-cost debt, where possible, and we have an effort to do that.     2017 objectives, which we mentioned last year, I'd like to bring everyone up to date on exactly how we performed relative to these. First objectivewas actively bidding on the optical assembly business, which could add both substantial revenue and profitability. For 2017, while we were biddingon this business, we did not get any orders. However, in 2018, we are building a prototype assembly operation we should be launching during theyear, and we are hopeful of that prototype assembly generating some business for us in optical assemblies. Number 2, launching e-commerce website in specific product offerings, not otherwise available in the marketplace, as well as traditional products.New e-commerce site will be Dynasil branded with sub-links to the individual company's websites. As I mentioned, we launched 3 e-commercesites throughout the year: Optometrics, EMF and Fused Silica, all under the Dynasil branded name, and Hilger was launched in early 2018. Three, Xcede, funded through first in-human trial opportunity for monetization through acquisition sale dividend to Dynasil stockholders oradditional financing over the next 18 months. Xcede is status quo. We were unable to divvy the dividend. However, we are actively looking atfinancing through an investment banker and considering other options. First in-human clinical trial could begin this year, 2018. Number 4, commercial growth in revenue for RMD is expected to double this year, and again, double over the next 2 years. For 2017, our commercialrevenue and RMD tripled. 2018 looks like an off year. There are substantial opportunities, but the timing is conditional on government appropriationsand bids. Over the next 3 years, we believe the overall trajectory of the RMD commercial revenue will be significant, but individual year timing isdifficult to forecast. Number 5. Hilger array business expected to return to 2016 levels by the summer of 2017. CsI business, also expected to increase over the next 18months. Unfortunately, the Hilger array business did not return to the 2016 levels during 2017. In fact, it dramatically dropped off. However, it isbeginning to pick up -- it has started to pick up in October 2018, will be ramping during the year and will be approaching the 2016 levels by theend of 2018. I would like to talk a little bit about the future, the next year or so, things that we're measuring and that, ultimately, we'll report on a year from now.First is launch and procure business for both the HEAR IR and optics assembly business. Next, process and equipment necessary for HEAR to beprocured and installed by the third quarter of 2018; continued development of a long-term strategic plan; continued support of Xcede throughclinical trial. Financing will be necessary during 2018. And we are going to put an increased emphasis on marketing this year, maximizing exposureto products through e-commerce websites, generation of leads for sales teams, planning for and implementing the CRM system and we will behiring a VP of Marketing. So that concludes the formal portion of my report. I'm now going to turn it over to Dr. Linda Zuckerman, who's going to give us an update onXcede.",False,True
105,64390349,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Dynasil Corporation of America Annual Shareholders Meeting,Linda Zuckerman,"Xcede Technologies, Inc.","Thank you to our shareholders. It's nice to be back after a year. We've made significant progress with Xcede, and I'm happy to share that with youtoday. We'll go to the next slide. I just want to remind that we have a pretty specific vision. We're dedicated to the development and commercializationof innovative surgical products. We want to bring not just useful product, but superior products that provide value to both our patient population,as well as hospital payers, and while we do that, we'll build value to our investors. We have a list of strengths, which include a deep pipeline, goodstrategic partners and experienced management team and a strong IP portfolio. Next slide. We have had several significant accomplishments in 2017. We've transitioned the company from a startup to a clinical stage company,and we have an eye for being a commercial focused company as well. We've had several patents that have been issued for our technologies, bothhere in the U.S. and abroad. And we continue to file our applications outside of the U.S. to increase our worldwide IP coverage. We've also managedour cash very well, and this has allowed us to have an increased runway to realize more of our accomplishments, and we've increased our visibilityin the field. There has been several potential products in licensing opportunities that we have evaluated. None of those have come to fruition todate, but this has increased our visibility significantly with potential strategic partners and others that compete in the field.     We've had many accomplishments over the last year. These are focused primarily around our hemostatic patch, which is our lead product. We havecompleted our preclinical safety and efficacy testing of the patch. And we have completed with our manufacturing partner, Cook Biotech and WestLafayette, our good manufacturing practice -- manufacturing process. We have recently submitted our dossier to the Medical Ethical ReviewCommittee in the Netherlands, where we're going to execute our first clinical trial, and we're waiting on recommendations from that committee.There's likely questions have to be answered. And if we can overcome that hurdle, we will start our first clinical trial in 2018 and those are firstpatient with the Xcede patch. To that end, we've undertaken many of the standard clinical activities required with doing and executing a complete clinical trial. As I mentioned,we have an eye toward also being a commercial company, as well as getting our patch approved here in the United States, and we have quite along to-do list. I won't read those out loud for you, except to say that we're very diligent in thinking about executing through our activities to bringvalue to our patients to our payers, and realize the Xcede patch as a superior hemostatic product. With that, we're also keeping an eye closely on the market, so significant market potential both here and in the European Union. We've also startedto think about our commercial positioning. We think we can capture significant portions of the Xcede patch market through a lower cost moreefficacious product. We also think that we will steal share from other segments in the market due to our efficacy and our price point. And we liketo think that we'll have significant pharmaco-economics benefit that will come, and we'll measure it during our clinical trials, and these will be ofsignificant interest to hospital payers. We'd like to see reductions, and we hope to see reductions in operating room time, blood products used,length of hospital stay. All these help drive strong value proposition, and make the patch more attractive as a product in the commercial space. We are also acutely aware that there are significant players and forces in the market space, and we're not the only up-and-coming entrants, so I'velisted a few others. Some of you are based here in the U.S. Others are in Europe. We also notice there are companies that have more than 1 patch,and to be successful, we would like to have a portfolio of products. For example, our sort of 400-pound gorilla, Johnson & Johnson and Baxter,have a line of hemostasis products, and we aspire to that, as do other products, which either have 1 or 2 products in the space. So we keep veryclosely -- very close track of these market forces and who is doing what. And that's my concluding message to you. Hopefully, I will come back ina year and show you clinical data if all continues to go according to plan. Thank you. I'd like to introduce, before I leave, Dr. Kanai Shah. He's the President of RMD.",False,True
106,64390349,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Dynasil Corporation of America Annual Shareholders Meeting,Kanai S. Shah,"RMD Instruments, LLC","Thank you, Linda. So good morning. And I'd like to provide the status update and recap of RMD's activities in the last year. And so in terms of fiscal2017, we closed the year at about $18 million. And as Peter alluded to earlier, one of the highlights of last year was that our product sales tripledover the year before. So we are on the trajectory of strong growth in product portfolio and while the timing is difficult to predict, we definitelyanticipate that could be a major growth area for RMD in coming years. In terms of the current budget for the FY '18 period, we are essentially expecting a similar budget to FY '17, but again, we continue to focus onproduct portfolios very strongly. We have a pretty strong backlog at present, $30-plus million and we -- in the spring cycle, we have whole bunchof bids out there, where we anticipate hearing more on the results for them. One of the major highlights of our research activity is continuing topush for larger and longer projects, the idea being that, essentially, you need less projects to keep the research going, and you can have more timeto actually research the products. The -- in terms of product activity is we continue to engage very strongly with OEMs on several of our emerging-- several of our new technologies, essentially to make sure that the pipeline for that is pretty strongly established. And we continue to have astrong active portfolio. Last year, we had 6 awarded patents, and I think applications filed renewal total awarded patents to 68. Next slide please. And so with that, I'd like to kind of go into maybe a deeper dive in some of the exciting projects that are going on at RMD. Next slide. So in all of the interesting NIH funded projects sort of health-funded projects we have going on at RMD is to -- is in the area of fightingand combating cancer. As -- and everybody's aware, one of the major therapies for combating cancer is radiation treatment, and the procedureworks by damaging the DNA in the cancer cells through the oxidation that happens in the cells. Now the tumors are bigger and some of the innercore of the cancer tumors are -- don't have enough oxygen in them. That effectiveness is reduced, and so the developing nano particles, which     together with Spectrum Labs use Caesium iodide crystals, coupled with silicon for the multiplier, and we have developed a robust technology,which can operate in pretty high temperatures. And last year, we've supplied a group of Taiwanese detectors to Spectrum Labs, and they wereevading to the(inaudible) platform to really have the imaging system and the early results look very promising. We anticipate this being an activityin coming years for RMD. So again, thank you for your time, and I look forward to talking to you next year again. And I like to introduce Dr. Gary Bishop from our photonicsdivision to give the next presentation.",False,True
107,64390349,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Dynasil Corporation of America Annual Shareholders Meeting,Gary J. Bishop,Dynasil Corporation of America,"Good morning, everybody. My responsibility is for the Dynasil commercial optics businesses. And specifically, I'm responsible for the performanceof 3 of Dynasil's operating companies. Dynasil Fused Silica produces fused silica blanks, the fundamental building blocks for polished optics andlenses and windows for the optical component industry. EMF, the oldest coating company in the United States coats a broad range of glasses, metals and plastics. For example, specialized mirrors in thedental industry and cold mirrors for automotive head up displays. Finally, Optometrics specializes in the production of wavelength selectivecomponents. For example, very high volume optical diffraction gratings and narrow and broadband optical filters. I'm now very excited to tell you a little bit about the new significant thrust at Dynasil into the infrared optical coating, optical component andoptical assembly market. In late 2016, Dynasil hired a new business development person, who brought more than a decade in technical expertisein infrared coatings to Dynasil. While Dynasil was developing its initial infrared coating capability, acquisitions and consolidations in the photonicsindustry led to an immediate infrared optical supply opportunity to those who are able to react. Dynasil put a strategic plan in place to acceleratethis move into the infrared optics market with investments in equipment, infrastructure and people, approved by Dynasil's Board of Directors lastsummer. Dynasil launched its foray into the optics and infrared optics market at photonics last month, which is Dynasil's largest trade show of theyear. Infrared optics are critical to thermal imaging used by security services and in autonomous driving to enhance night vision. In 2017, Dynasil hireda senior optical coating engineer who brings extensive experience in the design of these infrared coatings and coating technologies in the productionof the coated optics. Dynasil's initial product offerings consist of high-efficiency anti-reflection coatings to maximize the transmission of this infraredlight through the lens system to the camera. Early next quarter, Dynasil will have a Dynasil-optimized fourth-generation diamond-like coating chamber, operational, and will be able to coatthe surfaces of the windows or lenses that are subject to the exterior elements of the weather that most of these lenses see. The addition of thediamond-like coating will provide the one-stop shop solution mentioned on the previous slide and demanded by our customers. The next logical extension to the one-stop shop solution is to produce complete optical subassemblies to our customers' end products. For this,Dynasil needs to have a clean space capability, which is currently under development, as well as the expertise to run such a facility. Dynasil is verypleased to announce that its new manager of operations in Littleton in the area of Massachusetts brings high volume optical assembly expertiseto the company. Dynasil has also secured the services of an optical industry veteran in the quality assurance management side of the business tofurther enhance our capabilities for our upstate New York coating facilities in Ithaca and Rochester. The next slide provides an exploded view of what a typical optical assembly might look like. Other ongoing initiatives inside Dynasil, one of themajor ones has been -- this new incompletion has been the upgrade of our web presence from both a subsidiary perspective, as well as the corporateneeds. With the Dynasil subsidiaries being folded under the Dynasil banner, we are now providing 1 phase to the customer. The advantage thatthis brings to the customer can now grasp the extensive technological and manufacturing capability that Dynasil can bring to bear in support ofour customers' needs. Dynasil also launched its commerce capability that provides our customers with the access -- direct access to broad productofferings in Dynasil's portfolio.     We've seen strong demand for our precision blank fabrication. With the ever-increasing demand for thinner, lighter, more compact, mobile phones,computer-related technologies, this has accelerated the use of next-generation production technologies. Extreme ultraviolet imaging technologiesare now being used to further reduce the feature size in the next-generation microprocessors to either make these devices smaller or packing morecomputing power. This has led, in part, to increased demand for Fused Silica used in the optics that provide the parts of the imaging system and these next-generationproducts and technologies. Dynasil's extensive knowledge and technical expertise in Fused Silica blank production is supporting the ramp of theseleading edge production capabilities. While Dynasil is very good at high volume optical coating and optical component production, it also has extensive experience in coating very large,very heavy optical components. Recently, Dynasil's Ithaca facility assisted the world-renowned Palomar Observatory in San Diego in the designand coating of a 50-inch 1.3-meter diameter, 1/2 inch thick lens that had to be produced in a short timeframe. In the same vein, last year, Dynasil'sIthaca facility coated a reflective surface of a 40-inch 1-meter diameter mirror for an observatory in New South Wales. This was achieved -- sorry,this mirror was turned around in 4 days from the time the mirror arrived at Ithaca's facility, saving the end-user a lot of time and money in thatprocess. Dynasil also coats very large mirrors for flight simulators. Thank you very much indeed for your time.",False,True

114,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"Thanks, Schafer. Howdy all, and welcome to CyrusOne's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. We had a really good quarter and another outstanding year, putting up very strong results and continuing to grow our U.S. business organicallywhile strategically positioning the company to grow internationally. Since we just celebrated our fifth anniversary as a public company, I wantedto begin with a brief recap of our accomplishments over that period. As Slide 4 shows, we have been consistently executing the same methodical strategy for the past 5 years, which is no different than what we hadbeen doing for the prior 10 years when we were private. Our strategy is simple. First, we have been and will continue to be maniacally focused onbeing the low-cost leader in the industry, being able to bring on megawatts of capacity at the lowest cost and fastest time to market, which hasenabled us to generate mid-teens returns and reduce our capital at risk. While a few have doubted our capabilities in this area, and despite ourwillingness to explain investors how we do it, I would just point out that many companies in our industry seem to now be constantly talking aboutcost savings, supply chain efficiency, modular building techniques and speed to market, which are all things we were innovating on for many years.So if imitation is a form of flattery, we are doing pretty well. Having said that, we believe there remains significant demand for quality data centerspace for years to come, and there is plenty of room for successful growth across our industry and our peer group. The second thing that we do, which is arguably our greatest strength, is sell. We identified and targeted selling to enterprise customers many yearsago and have been incredibly successful targeting this segment. Three years ago, we believe that the cloud companies were going to change thedata center landscape, and we started focusing on those customers, 3 years later, we count practically every single cloud company as a customer,all of which are asking us to expand internationally with them. Over the 5-year period since our IPO, we have stuck to these 2 strategies and have methodically grown and significantly diversified the business,expanding our portfolio across the entire United States. Over this period, we have more than tripled our revenue and adjusted EBITDA, increasedthe size of our real estate portfolio by 4 million square feet to a total of nearly 6 million and quintupled the value of the company. In short, throughthe tremendous effort of an incredible team and never veering from our course, we have basically exceeded every goal we had set out to achievefor ourselves 5 years ago and have been the fastest-growing company in our industry during this period. Moving to Slide 5. Revenue of $180.5 million was up 31% over the fourth quarter of 2016, and adjusted EBITDA of $104.2 million was up 43%, whichwas one of the highest growth rates since our IPO. Normalized FFO of $0.84 per share was up 24% compared to last year. In the quarter, we leased9 megawatts of power and 86,000 colocation square feet, and our bookings totaled $18 million in annualized GAAP revenue, 10% below ourbookings goal of $20 million as a result of some deal delays for some very large cloud customers that pushed to Q1. For the year, we signed 58 megawatts and more than 520,000 square feet totaling $105 million in revenue, an average of more than $26 millionper quarter, which is over 30% above our targeted quarterly close rate and well above our respective market share as measured by revenue. As Slide 6 shows, we signed 20 new customers this quarter with the highest total in the past 2.5 years. Roughly 60% of our deals this quarter werefor smaller deployments, highlighting our enterprise sales focus, which resulted in an average price of $170 per kilowatt, which is 12% higher thanour trailing 4-quarter average and 25% greater than our trailing 8-quarter average when we had some very large hyperscale deals. We continueto sell well above our respective market share, and bookings for the year were equivalent to 18% of our base revenue, which will continue to propelour growth into 2018 and beyond. As shown on Slide 7, we are continuing to see strong performance in our interconnection business, which generated $9.2 million of revenue in thequarter. This is up 20% year-over-year, which is one of the highest growth rates in the industry and reflects the changing network topology, drivenby hyperscale cloud deployments in our facilities, combined with the hybrid cloud deployments of our enterprise customers. As an aside, addingIX to our product portfolio has been the only meaningful change we have made to our product offering in the last 10 years and has been verysuccessful as measured by its growth rate.     development opportunities in the late stages of negotiation in London, Frankfurt and Dublin. Additionally, we anticipate achieving future costsynergies through the benefits of scale such as improved purchase economics and potentially through acquisitions as we expand into additionalmarkets. Given the maturation of the European data center market, significant demand growth, particularly for larger deals and the positioning of Zenium,we believe there's a tremendous opportunity over the coming years. We hope to close on the transaction at the beginning of the second quarter,and would expect to have closed a number of additional deals by then as well. We estimate that Zenium's adjusted EBITDA will grow by over 80%next year. However, the bigger opportunity that we will acquire with Zenium is a platform that will enable us to acquire many other assets in Europe,which will be substantially more accretive as we will have an efficient platform to acquire them with. In closing, we ended 2017 in a very strong position. We generated fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 31% and 43%, respectively,which are some of our fastest growth rates over the past 5 years. We increased our dividend an additional 10% and have almost tripled it over thepast 5 years. We also raised $700 million of capital in the quarter with leverage of 4.7 and ended the year with over $1.2 billion of liquidity, whichwill enable us to continue to fund our growth throughout 2018. Given our strong fundamental performance this quarter as well as our peers, it's pretty astonishing that the REITs have fallen by 11% since thebeginning of the year and the data centers by an even greater amount, which are down by about 16% since January 1. While it'll be easy to concludethat the recent stock price performance -- that there are some bigger issues facing our industry, I think this is shortsighted. Our business isfundamentally just as strong today as it was 2 months ago. The growth in our business is driven by an outsourcing trend in cloud and enterprisecompanies, and as you saw from the recent record results posted by Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce, which grew between 40% to 60%year-over-year, this trend is not slowing down anytime soon and will continue to propel our business for the next several years. While rising interest rates are not helpful for REITs in general, I would point out that the data centers are growing at considerably faster rates thanthe average REIT, in our case, almost 500% faster, and the best way to combat rising interest rates is through growth. Given where our stock priceis currently trading, we are offering a 4% dividend yield and just provided 2018 EBITDA guidance of 25% growth this year as well. There are notmany investment opportunities in the industry that carry this type of current cash yield with a very strong secular growth story attached to it, whichis why I believe that the longer term our share price and my peers will continue to do very well. I will now turn the call over to Diane who'll provide more color on our financial performance for the quarter and our guidance for '18. Thanks a lot.",False,True

As Gary mentioned, we were very busy in 2017 and had another great year. As Slide 13 shows, our growth in the fourth quarter was particularly strong. Adjusted EBITDA grew 43% compared to the prior year, and that wasthe second-highest quarterly growth rate since our IPO, while revenue and normalized FFO grew 31% and 39%, respectively. The company's growth continues to be driven primarily by strong leasing execution in both the cloud and enterprise company industries and thegrowth of the interconnection business. In addition, our 2017 results included 10 months of operations from our Sentinel acquisition. Full yearchurn was 3.9%, below the lower end of our full year guidance range of 6% to 8% and the lowest annual churn rate since 2013. We anticipate thatour full year 2018 churn will be in the 6% to 8% range, consistent with our annual forecast for the past several years. The weighted average remaining lease term of our portfolio is currently at almost 4.5 years, which has nearly doubled over the last 5 years. Overthe same period, the percentage of month-to-month contracts and up for renewal in the next 12 months has steadily decreased. We expect thatover time, this percentage will continue to decrease as our average new lease terms are longer than the remaining duration of our existing portfolio. Turning to Slide 14. NOI grew 34% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by the increase in revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin was up 4.6percentage points and at nearly 58%, which was our highest quarterly margin as a public company. As we've discussed in past quarters, this",False,True

And then can you give us an update on the Atlanta property and remind us how much of that has been preleased and when we couldexpect to see some operations there?",True,False
118,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"Sure. Frank, Gary. So the way we think about it is as we are coming out of '17, we were trying to bring on additional inventory capacity available inall the key markets, which we were sold out last year. In my prepared remarks, I talked about roughly 250,000 square feet of space available builtout now that we can sell into. If we were to sell out all of that and just deliver that capacity perfectly as customers would take it, we'd generateanywhere between $120 million, $140 million of additional revenue. Clearly, customers don't take the capacity in exactly as we build it out, so we'regoing to bring on some additional capacity towards the end of the year, depending on how customer demand warrants. So when you think abouthow much capital that we're going to be spending domestically, a lot of that is going to be conditioned upon sales that we expect to occur overthe beginning of the year. When Diane spoke, she talked about the different amounts of capital projects that we're bringing online and sharedinsight in terms of how much of those things are presold that we're building towards demand, and she also, in our prepared remarks, providedsome overview of when our revenue expects to come online. But when you look at, at a high level, we're going to spending about $300 millionless in capital this year. Just off the bat, that's going to be directed to Europe. And the remaining amount of that $500 million is going to be basicallysuccess-based as customer demand warrants over the year. With regard to Atlanta, and for that matter, the Quincy property is the same, that webought those to basically position those properties that we could be responsive to customer needs, that we could build quickly. So our focus is toget those permitted, ready to go and on the shelf when we have a customer in tow so that we could deliver that capacity for customers as demandwarrants. Those are going to be basically triggered by build-to-suit type deals where we're going to need about a 4- or 5-megawatt type buildbefore we kind of commit to putting something there. We've worked out our supply chain such that we can deliver that capacity in 6 months,which is well within the time frame most customers need. So if you see us building anything in Atlanta, you should assume that we have a customercontract in hand before we do that.",True,False

You said you signed your first Chinese cloud deal. Where will that be located? And is that a deal you'll have directlywith CyrusOne to the customer? Or is the GDS deal sort of through you? How should we think about that?,True,False
120,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"Yes, it's a deal that we will have directly with that customer. It'll be here. We're also talking to them about potentially Europe as well. And that'sgoing to be done directly with us. We've got probably about a dozen deals right now in the funnel between customers that we're talking to thatwant to take space in GDS facilities in China and their customers that want to take space in our facilities in the U.S. So that relationship is goingreally well.",True,False

122,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Robert Ari Gutman,"Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. At Chandler VI, I noticed a little bit of rearrangement of the -- from the prestabilized property, some with 12 megawatts was launched.6 megawatts went back into development. I was wondering if that's potentially related to the pushed-out deal or what you're seeing relate to thatfacility or more broadly, the Phoenix market. And secondly, I just wanted to ask, with the fixed to floating ratio at 60-40, how do you feel about thatlooking forward against the macroeconomic environment?",True,False
123,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Diane M. Morefield,CyrusOne Inc.,"Well, let me address the interest rate first. I mean, we have stated generally, we're comfortable in the 50-50 range. With rising rates, we do -- weare more conscious of going to a more fixed rate. We can certainly do that synthetically through swaps. But the reality is floating rates, even withoutlook for increases in LIBOR this year, is still at a very low rate. The other thing is we're balancing that if we get to investment-grade, that is whenwe would want to fix more of our debt because there's at least a 100 basis point advantage for fixed rates when you're investment-grade. So wedo want to keep a reasonable amount of floating rate debt to be able to fix it when we achieve investment-grade.",True,False
124,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"Yes. With regard to our markets, I mean, this quarter, Rob, we -- Phoenix was actually our strongest markets. We sold the most of our capacity inPhoenix followed by Dallas, Austin -- Dallas and Northern Virginia. I'm not sure specifically what you're talking about with stabilized or not, but ourfunnel is -- as I mentioned in my comments, is up 9% sequentially and 40% year-over-year. So we're sitting in a really strong position. The majorityof that funnel is for capacity in Phoenix, Virginia and Texas. But we can [Schafer] get back to you on what you're specifically you're referring to.",True,False

126,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Yong Choe,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to follow up. I know you mentioned it in your prepared comments, but wanted to get a little bit more color. Given how much the stockhas sold off and how a lot of the reports have, I think, in a lot investors' minds been a little soft and guidance not as strong, are you seeing anythingdifferent out there? Do you see demand still being strong? And then to be a little bit cynical on it is that you're dropping your domestic CapEx from,call it, 800 to 500. Is that a sign? Or is just the shifting of opportunity into Europe?",True,False
127,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"Yes, yes, Rich. Look, I mean, you have to think about our industry in the context of what's going on more broadly in the IT landscape and, in particular,cloud, right. So you're coming off record sales for Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce. All of these companies came off fantastic quarters for e-commerce,for cloud businesses overall. And their growth is pretty tremendous, I mean, between 40% to 60% type growth rates on companies that are tenfoldbillions of dollar type top line companies. So these are really large companies growing at tremendous growth rates. And you see that they're notslowing down. Our business, by definition, will not slow down because all of that growth that you're seeing in the cloud all resides in the datacenter, and we are just providing the infrastructure that continues to support that growth. I think if there's anything that people should read infrom a quarter-to-quarter sales is just the lumpiness of how the industry works, right? I mean, these are really large transactions. When we're doing     these big cloud deals, these are $400 million or $500 million purchase commitments by these customers, right? So these aren't like really shortsales cycles. These are long sales cycles, and they take a really long time. And while we feel that the quarterly result is little below our $20 millionestimate, we feel good when you look at this on the context of what we've been able to do over the last year. And over the year, we put up resultsat about 30% greater than our expectations. When you think about our refocus in terms of CapEx, think about it in 2 ways. One is last year, we werebasically sold out. We were bringing on capacity all year long just to build out and meet existing customer demand that was already presold. Webrought on additional capacity to make sure we had inventory in those key markets because we didn't want to run out of inventory. Last year,there were a couple of deals that we lost to other smaller startup players that we wouldn't have lost had we had inventory available. So we wantedto be thoughtful on bringing on additional capacity, which we basically did through year-end. The result of that is that you're going to see us spendsignificantly less capital in the U.S. because we have more inventory now that we didn't have last year. So we feel really strong from that. The otherthing you should think about is the way we're spending our capital is exactly in line with what we've been telling all of our partners for the last 1.5years or so is that we believe, fundamentally, this is an international business that to really be effective and helpful to customers, you need to havea global portfolio. And if you don't, you're in an inferior position strategically and you'll eventually be consolidated up. Our focus has always beenexpanding internationally. When we've been talking about that in the fourth quarter, what you saw is exactly what we said we were going to do.First we came out of the gate with the partnership with GDS and an investment that we made in them, which has more than doubled over the lastcouple of months. And then we followed that up shortly with further expansion in Zenium, which we're going to basically use as our land-and-expandstrategy in Europe. So we acquired that entity at a pretty high multiple. It's a dilutive acquisition, but strategically, we think it's really valuablebecause we're going to follow up with some additional capital to work there and build out a really big presence in Europe. And we expect the sameway methodically we've grown in U.S. over the last several years. We're going to do the same thing in Europe because we don't think that thecompetitive landscape is nearly as vicious in Europe as it is in the U.S. And from a product perspective, no one is doing big format data centers inEurope as they are doing in the U.S. We feel really confident about our ability to execute over there and export the same level of success wegenerated in states to Europe.",True,False
128,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Diane M. Morefield,CyrusOne Inc.,"I think, Richard, the other thing you have to think about for the domestic CapEx, we ended the year with almost $0.5 billion in CIP, and obviously,that's completely a domestic pipeline. And that -- hence the additional inventory that we went into this year with. And we're still estimating another$0.5 billion for domestic construction. So we're still spending about $1 billion in the U.S., but to Gary's point, the marginal capital is way moreweighted now towards international for the year.",True,False

130,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Amir Rozwadowski,"Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division","A couple of questions, if I may. Dovetailing on the prior question in terms of global demand picture right now, Gary, if we think about the opportunityset in the U.S. versus Europe, clearly, as you mentioned, the incremental dollars is going to Europe at the moment in terms of spending. But do youexpect that shift to push or recycle back into the U.S.? Just trying to understand sort of how you think about the longer-term picture of the demanddynamics here.",True,False
131,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"It goes back into, you have to think broadly about what's occurring in the cloud landscape, right? I mean, that industry is still in its early stages.Maybe it's a $60 billion or $70 billion type of market right now out of $1 trillion annual enterprise spend. So really, really early stages. What you'reseeing is that the initial amount of that growth that was taking off was predominantly focused in the U.S., and that's what you saw over the lastcouple of years. And I expect that, that's going to continue to grow really nicely in this country for many, many years. The more incremental levelof growth, however, in the last 4 quarters has been in Europe. As that area of the world has been developing, there's been a lot more focus by cloud     companies that have been deciding to go to Europe to do things at scale. And that's -- a great example of that is Zenium, the business that we'reacquiring. Like Franek, a serial entrepreneur, he's created a couple of companies, and he just created this one a few years ago and what did he dowas he started an operation and he quickly expanded into 4 data centers in 2 of the key cities in Europe. And this is like a private operator, smallercompany but tremendously successful, giving you a really good insight in terms of the competitive profile there that a small private company wasable to be so successful. That's why we believe that when we go there, we're going to basically be able to accelerate that growth, do things at scaleand at a lower cost in Europe, similar to what we've been doing in the U.S. and be able to take tremendous market share, right? We've been takingmore market share in the U.S -- the market domestically than anyone. Even, again, this quarter, in spite of like a bookings quarter that was a littlebelow our estimates, we still took 20% market share in the U.S. and, well, actually, globally if you compare one of our competitors at international.We still did really well versus a revenue share that's only about 15%. So we're punching well above our weight. We expect once we go to Europe,we're going to be able to accelerate that same success over there.",True,False
132,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Amir Rozwadowski,"Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. And if I think about sort of the pieces in terms of the longer-term growth for you folks, you had mentioned with the Zeniumdeal, 80% growth next year on an EBITDA basis and accretive on a normalized FFO basis, the potential to do additional deals in Europe, and Europein and of itself seems to be accelerating in terms of demand. Does this setup indicate -- I know it's early stage that '19 could be a better growthyear in terms of how you're thinking about things?",True,False
133,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"Yes. For us, absolutely. If you think about all the things that we're just talking about on this call, right, and particularly in the bridge that Dianeshared in terms of the FFO bridge, like if you excluded all of these additional investments that we're doing, the GDS investments, dilution of Zenium,the additional capital that we put on the ground, I mean, our FFO per share would be up 15% year-over-year. We're intentionally taking off someof that to basically pay that forward in terms of setting up the company for a really nice growth rate well into '19 and beyond, because we'repositioning ourselves to take advantage of a competitive profile that we think we're going to be able to win in. And what that does is when wemade those investments in the U.S., it really frees the teams up to really focus on doing this in Europe. So now we have additional inventory. Wedon't need the same kind of construction design teams focused on building that out, what they were doing here. We'll repurpose them to focuson Europe and create the same level of success over there. So the way we run the business is all looking down the road in terms of where we'regoing to be in 5 years' time. Like none of these are short-term, short-duration assets. We're building a business that's going to be, we believe, thethird global data center player in the world, and we think we're positioned well to achieve that success.",True,False

I think that there is an opportunity for a lot of people to do well together, but what you're seeing,     from our perspective, is that we think we have adequate inventory built out now, which is why we are not looking at bringing on significantly moreinventory available in the U.S. And we think that the better use of our capital is really to position the company for additional growth in Europe.We'll see how some of these other private companies shake out.

Is that still a good number to use for 2018? And then on Zenium, can you justtalk a little bit about what your customer and potential customer commentary has been since you announced that deal? What's the reception beenlike to them and to those assets? And let's say, you close it early in Q2 as you expect, is there much work that you need to do to prep that for bringingin some of your new customers or can that start to lease up with some of your pipeline pretty quickly in mid- and later 2018?",True,False
145,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"Sure, sure. Yes, I think the $20 million is a good bogey. And once we feel confident that the funnel is substantially higher than where it currentlysits now and we feel good that we can tick that up, we will, right? But we feel good about what we've been able to do this year. I mean, in aggregate,we guided to $80 million of bookings for the year and we delivered $105 million of bookings throughout the year. So we're 30% over what we toldfolks that we were going to do. We expect, as we head into '18, we're going to have quarters that we do above that, but we don't want to createexpectations that we're consistently going to be doing that. When I feel really good about the size of our funnel broadly, I'll definitely increase thatand share that with everyone. But for the time being, we're sitting in a pretty good position. I mean, our funnel is up 9% sequentially, 40% up versuslast year. Part of the 9% sequential increase is that some of the opportunities that we had expected to close in the first quarter pushed to the fourth.So we expect that those are going to -- that we expected to close in the fourth pushed to the first. So we expect that we should do well this quarter.With regard to Zenium, the response has been great. I mean, 75% of the customers that Zenium has are basically overlapping customers with us.And so the opportunity to do more with those customers over there was -- is great. I mean, they're really relieved that they have a solid partnernow with us, a capital partner that understands their business. So we expect that we're going to be able to help Franek grow his business a lotfaster than they originally were able to do, and we're more willing to bring on additional capacity there to supplement the growth of what theywould have normally done as a private company. We're a little more willing to do capital deployments for the opportunities that we see becausewe have a bigger sales funnel that we're tracking in the U.S., that we can bring to Europe than they probably have visibility to.",True,False

I'm just curious,how do you balance the growth plans with some of the cost of capital that's coming in a little bit? And then maybe tie that into sort of howcomfortable you are with taking leverage up or what you're comfortable taking leverage up to.",True,False
150,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"Yes. Look, I think the response in general has just been completely overblown for our -- the data centers as an asset class and us in particular, right?I think if you look at the fundamental growth drivers for our business, they are just as strong now as they were 2 months ago prior to an interestrate increase, which, as an aside, the 10 years only moved up 50 bps in 2 months. So it's not like a really significant move, particularly giving theabsolute returns that we generate in our business and the lower amount of leverage in general in the data center asset class versus the other REITsbroadly. So it's concerning that the equity has moved where it did, but I think for other people that are looking at it now, I think it's a pretty attractiveentry point. At a 4% cash yield with the growth story attached to it, it's a pretty interesting story. With regard to the way we think about theopportunity and how to use additional equity for -- to fund these transactions, I think you should look for us to continue to do the same thing wehave methodically. I mean, as Diane mentioned, our leverage coming out of the year was 4.7, so we're at a really low levered balance sheet. We     had $1.2 billion of liquidity. So we have plenty of liquidity available to fund the growth over this period, and I think, to the extent that the equitylevels stay at these depressed levels, we're probably going to be willing to take up the leverage a little bit more. But longer term, as we've alwayssaid is that we need to stay on investment-grade glide path, and we don't want to do anything that jeopardizes our ability to do that. So you'll seeus as we've done over the past year, bring on additional equity when it's warranted. Over the course of '17, I think we raised about $700 million ofequity over the course of the year. And all the equity raises and everything else that we're planning to do are fundamentally embedded in theper-share guidance number that we had shared in that. So while we've never been specific about how much equity we're going to raise in anypoint in time, we always have also been very thoughtful, making sure that our balance sheet never gets over-levered because we want to makesure that we're continuing to grow in a strong manner.",True,False
151,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Diane M. Morefield,CyrusOne Inc.,"Yes. I mean, just to add on to Gary, the key point is, again, we were very proactive entering the year with a lot of liquidity, given we knew Jonathanwas looking at things that we may need to fund in the future. So we have no near-term pressure, given our leverage. The other thing is we're verytransparent with the rating agencies that there will be times we push leverage, particularly after funding an acquisition and then manage it overtime. So we don't feel any near-term pressure, and we do think what's going on in the market seem to be, as Gary said, really overdone.",True,False
152,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Vincent Chao,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And maybe as a follow-up question. Can you just remind us, I think, the ratings reviews are typically done mid-year. Is that right? So was thatsort of the first opportunity you think you could potentially get that ratings increase? And maybe just remind us what you think would be a leveragelevel that might have an impact on a potential upgrade.",True,False
153,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Diane M. Morefield,CyrusOne Inc.,"We don't -- obviously, we don't control the rating agencies nor when they choose to review us. So the cycle has varied, and we're closer with S&P,and Moody's is a little farther off. And we also keep up the dialogue with Fitch. So all we can do from our standpoint is continue to communicatethe story and the safety of our balance sheet. The other thing that's kind of crazy, our fixed charge coverage is over 5x. So we just communicatewith them and meet with them and talk to them after every quarterly call, but we don't have any visibility on what their review cycle is. The -- sowe can't tell you that. We just don't know it.",True,False
154,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"Yes. Look, Vin, I think, at the bigger picture, if you looked at us from the scale of the business and size of the business, the return on our assets, theamount of leverage that we have, the fixed charge coverage ratios, like every single metric that you look at, we're in a really solid position, and wecomp up very favorably to many, many other real estate companies that are investment grade now. So it's unclear to us why we're not investmentgrade now, but we don't want to do anything that jeopardizes our ability to do that. And we believe that if we continue to execute as we have overthe last 5 years, we're going to continue to get increases to our credit rating, which has improved every year over the last 5.",True,False

I guess, first, I know you said in your prepared remarks, but can you remind us how much in the guidance is impliedfor land acquisitions in 2018? And then just thinking kind of more broadly and longer term, when you came out of the IPO, you obviously had a     decent amount of land to develop on and now you've kind of worked your way through it, you're also expanding into new markets. And I guess,the question is as we model and think about your company over the next multiple years, should we be thinking about a certain run rate of landacquisitions every year for you guys to further grow your business?",True,False
157,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Diane M. Morefield,CyrusOne Inc.,"Well, for this year, and in the guidance, the marginal land acquisitions are in the $150 million range. And again, to remind you, we only did $20million of land acquisition in '17, which was the Atlanta parcel. So now we have plenty of land in the U.S. that are suitable for campuses, which ishow we like to develop. So if you look at our international guidance in the $300 million for CapEx range, roughly half is land and half is the buildoutof data center space, largely in the Zenium portfolio.",True,False
158,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"Yes. When you look at the time of our IPO, Jon, we had about $100 million of -- I mean, 100 acres of land in our inventory, and that was almost allexclusively in Cincinnati. It's currently at around 340 acres. And so that delta of 140 acres is all outside of Cincinnati. And so as we sit here right now,we have plenty of land available in basically every single U.S. market that we feel that we can meet plenty of existing inventory or existing customerdemand in all of our markets, with the exception of potentially Virginia and Phoenix, where we may need some additional capacity there in '19 orso. But right now, we could basically grow really nicely in the U.S. and never have to buy any additional land. So our focus from a land acquisitionperspective is going to be in Europe, where we're going to be looking to acquire additional properties to augment and accelerate the growth thatwe're picking up with Zenium and some of the other cities that we're looking at expanding to there.",True,False

And then, I'm curious, the bridge on the 2018 guidance, the Zenium acquisition, it looks like that's a $0.13 to $0.17 drag onyour estimates this year. I'm just kind of curious what the assumptions are around that. I know you raised a lot of equity in the fourth quarter. Isthat earmarked for the Zenium transaction as part of that dilution kind of the drag of raising capital before you actually close the deal?

With regard to the question on leasing, right, I mean, like $18 million of bookings in the quarter is prettystrong, I mean, relatively speaking, from a market perspective, right? That's about 20% of the market in the U.S. So we punched to well above ourweight in that quarter. Below the $20 million that we had mentioned, but when you look at these things over the course of the year, as I mentionedto Simon, we had $105 million in bookings on a guided number of $80 million. So we did well above that. We expect that, and this is the reasonwhy I've been hesitant to ever say we're going to be doing more than $20 million because we don't want people taking up their expectations andfactoring that in and setting expectations that we believe are unrealistic. That is exactly why I originally came out with the $20 million because     coming out of '16, we were seeing quarters of $40 million and $50 million of bookings. People thought that was going to continue forever, and Iwanted to tamp people's expectations down, which is the reason why I came out with that $20 million 5 or 6 quarters ago. So as I mentioned toSimon, once we feel good that the funnel is much bigger, we will take that up, but for the time being, people would assume that it's still $20 millionof bookings a quarter, and we expect that there's going to be some quarters we'll do above that. But we're not going to be guiding to that.

176,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Ahmed Sami Badri,"Cr�dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So regarding earlier comment you made regarding the smaller players winning deals in the market, just maybe so we can get a better sense, whattypes of yields are these players signing leases at?

177,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"Look, I think, Sami, when you look at -- look, we don't like losing. It's fundamentally what the read-in should be. When you look at the amount ofdeals that we closed this year, we closed the largest amount of deals proportionally than anyone in the industry in '17, and that was the same thingthat you saw in '16. Anytime we lose any deal to people, that's something that -- it just irritates us because we play to win. And when we lose, it'san opportunity lost for us. So our game has not changed. Our pricing, the way we approach customers, the way we do everything has not changedat all. And customers really like doing business with us, so that's why they continue to do more. The deals that I mentioned that we lost, these areactually pretty sizable deals and we lost it to good competitors that closed those deals. But the reason those competitors won was because wedidn't have inventory available in 2 key markets, which was Virginia and Chicago at the time, and we lost those deals to 2 other competitors thatfortunately won. So -- but nothing's changed in the competitive landscape. I think, if anything, I think what you see by the amount of people tryingto put capital to work here is that they all see how well everyone is doing, and they all see the broad demand and they see how big this industryis going to get to over time, which is why there's a lot of capital that's looking to come into the space either through private means or even in theJV arrangements that we've been discussing with folks. I think the underlying thesis for that is that everyone feels really good about the broadsecular demand drivers in this industry, which is why they're willing to commit the amount and duration of the capital that they will need to tie upin the space.",True,False

The reality is that 90% to 95% of all ofthe deals that we do, they are on a direct basis, and hardly any come through the channel. So I feel for you and all of your peers that are trying tocome up with estimates in terms of what the demand profile looks like, the pricing and that sort of thing because a lot of that data out there ispretty suspect because the reality is not a lot of those indirect channels have access to the customers and the deal flow that we do.

I expect, given thesales that we're tracking and the funnel that they are doing, that by the time this closes that, that multiple would probably be down 2 turns. Andthat's kind of -- we're trying to provide some type of insight into that. We're talking about 80% growth rate in Zenium for '19 to give you someflavor in terms of the type of growth that we're expecting out of that business.

Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"We're -- as I was mentioning, I forget we mention, I mean, the deals when they sign up with us are $400 million commitments, in case $500 millioncommitments with us. But in addition to that, the way most of these customers are doing their underwriting when they get their approvals is thatthey have to layer in the amount of additional capital that they have to put in to basically fill up these data centers. So if you think about it, right,the amount of capital that we put in is only about 1/3 of the capital that our customers would have to put in. So when they're going for approvalsin their organizations, their approval requests could be like $1 billion, $1.5 billion type commitment. And so those are big numbers. Even for guysthat have $40 billion of cash on their balance sheet, $1 billion, $1.5 billion commit is expensive. So I think what you're seeing there is just the resultsof that.

192,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Jordan Sadler,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then this is a little bit more of a bigger picture one. We've talked about the tenure a little bit and sort of the impact it may have had. ButI think the concern, the reason data centers have underperformed is maybe not a function of demand, which I think everybody believes the demandstory. It's as you've talked about, capital coming in and then the potential for supply. And Tom Ray's new company, Equinix is doing wholesale nowand so many others. And there seems to be little bit of fear for the potential for oversupply. It sounds like you're not buying that at all based on thedemand funnel, and I get that. But my question for you is if this narrative continues and it -- and rising rates continue to be a headwind, how doyou fund the business, the $1.5 billion or $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion of capital you're expecting to spend in 2018 without the equity market comingback?",True,False
193,64399826,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 CyrusOne Inc Earnings Call,Gary J. Wojtaszek,CyrusOne Inc.,"Sure. Yes. Look, I think -- and this is something -- and the reason why we have always managed the business to focus on costs is for exactly thisreason, right? So when we created this company, it's important to understand, we always wanted to be the low-cost provider in this industry exactlyfor this reason that we're talking about here today because if there's any -- look, this industry broadly is capital-intensive, high fixed cost. That typeof broad industry backdrop, regardless of the industry, is always susceptible to pricing. The reason why we have always maintained the low-costposition in the market and a supply chain that works as efficiently as it does is because I never wanted to put myself in a precarious position froma capital perspective, where I would be caught doing irrational things. We've always structured the business to make money because we can alwaysmake more money than everyone else because of what we've been able to do on our supply chain and our design. So we feel that we're in a really,really strong position. And as interest rates rise, some of the folks that are in inferior position on the left side of their balance sheet, meaning theircost to develop a megawatt of capacity is $10 million to $12 million to $13 million, they no longer have the right side of their balance sheet tocompete on. And as interest rates go up, their relative advantage that they would have done when they're just underwriting these things from apure equity return performance slowly goes away. And particularly, if you're levering up a lot, it goes even further away. So as interest rates rise,we believe that the low-cost provider in this industry is going to do really well, and we think that we're positioned to do really well. With regard tohow we think about the equity, we believe that longer term, our equity is going to continue to do well. Where it sits now, it's not really attractiveto us. And as Diane mentioned, I mean, we've got plenty of liquidity and availability that we can fund this additional capital growth for the Zeniumacquisition plus this additional stuff. She also mentioned that we'll probably take up leverage a little bit more. Unless we feel that the equity levelis appropriate, we are in no rush to additional or issue new amount of equity, just given where we sit now and know what our prospects are. But Ihope that gives you a little insight in terms of kind of -- and that's also the reason why we are very focused on becoming investment grade becausein a capital-intensive industry, it's really strategically important to have an investment-grade rating to make sure that you always have access tothe capital markets when others don't. So we think we're in a really good position as we're heading into '18 and '19 and from a cost perspectiveand a leverage perspective, and we think we're going to continue to do well.",True,False

The Company wasset up as a research organization and worked at that for many years. That has changed with the change of the Board. And by the way, the Chairman of the Board is also sitting here, Behzad, who many of you mayknow. But then also with the new leadership team that we brought onboard. And we think we have a great platform at hand, not just with IMMU-132 of ADC assets that are pretty unique and very differentiated. But also withothers that go after other targets. And not just for solid tumors, but also hematological malignancies. With that at hand and kind of with the expertise that we have inside of Immunomedics from a science perspective but also external talent that webrought in, we think we are now very well positioned to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, which means manufacturing,clinical, commercial, all-in.

And obviously in triple negative breast cancer, where we've seen some very impressiveresponses as we think about sort of the treatment paradigm there. And interestingly, IMMU-132 had sort of been developed in a very different direction than ADCs I think were sort of moving at the time. This isn'tsort of the most toxic payload that's out there, and this isn't sort of the most payload you can conjugate to an antibody.

204,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.","Yes, no, thanks. And it starts with the notion of it's really different. The paradigm of ADCs so far has been you have to have a very toxic warhead orpayload and you have to have a stable linker. And one is a little bit of a function of the other. If you have a very toxic payload in order to avoidoff-target side effects, you have to have this very stable linker, right? What that means is kind of the antibody needs to be internalized and then kind of the chemotherapy needs to enzymatically be cleaved off. TheCompany Immunomedics or our Company went a different path, starting with the payload, which is the active metabolite of irinotecan. Very activedrug, but certainly not comparable to this super-toxic payloads that other companies have been using. And due to the fact that we have SN-38 as our warhead, we can afford to have kind of a moderately stable linker. That has a couple of advantages:the drug is released at the tumor very, very quickly and it can actually be released not just in the tumor but also at the tumor when the antibodyis binding. So you have an effect in the cell, but you also have an effect at the tumor. And we think the efficacy and the tolerability profile of the drug, whichis actually very different to others, is a function of this differentiated way to look at ADCs.",False,True
205,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,"And so maybe just getting into the clinical data. Phase 2 trial, where we've seen a pretty impressive response rate, especially considering this is,again, triple negative breast cancer, a 34% response rate and PFS of 5 1/2 months. Overall survival out over a year. Can you maybe put this into context of how that compares to current standard of care? And I guess how we should be thinking about alternativetherapies for these agents?",False,True
206,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.","So the current therapy of this patient is really driven by clinical experience rather than by approved drugs. There is no approved drugs, unfortunately,in triple negative breast cancer. That's a shame, but it is like that. That's the first thing to say. The second thing to say that the current standard of care, which is taxanes, if those patients have not been pretreated before, which is platinumcompounds, which is eribulin, which is vinorelbine, is insufficient. It produces a lot of toxicity but very little efficacy.     And the efficacy goes down if you go down in the treatment lines. If you have patients with two or more prior treatments, you are talking about aresponse rate of 10% to 15%. You are talking about the progression-free survival of one to three months. And you measure the duration of responsein weeks. Almost to a point where you think you are harming patients more than doing something good to them. That said, I think a drug such as sacituzumab or IMMU-132 comes up with a very different proposition. The response rate that has been essentiallyadjudicated was 31%, but that doesn't mean that only a third of the patients is responding. We have actually round about 70% of the patients whohave some sort of tumor response, which is very different to what you see with chemotherapy. The duration of response is not measured in weeks, it's measured in months. So again, talking about the centrally adjudicated data here, which aremostly of interest. That's round about nine months; that's very, very different. And we have been talking about the progression-free survival already. I think that offers this patient population kind of a very, very different treatment paradigm. When you are looking at the toxicity side, there's twomain side effects. As expected, as you have a topoisomerase-1, you have some hematological toxicity. You have neutropenia. About 40% of thepatients have Grade 3/4 neutropenia. What I have to say is that as part of the protocol that led to the 110 patients that we presented and is going to go into the package to FDA, therewas not a very consistent use of GCSF. We changed this now in our confirmatory Phase 3 study. So in the package that you saw in San Antonio andthat we are submitting to the regulatory authorities, we had 7% of febrile neutropenia. 40% Grade 3 doesn't make an oncologist nervous. What makes the oncologist nervous is if the patient goes home and then gets fever, right? Thatwas out of 7%. We think we can bring this down substantially by GCSF use throughout. And --",False,True
207,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,"Can you just remind us what level of GCSF use was in that trial and why that is? I would think that is part of routine treatment in breast cancerespecially, unless this is in a country where GCSF isn't available.",False,True
208,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.","Yes, that's right. Most of the use has been therapeutic. So patients got it when they had febrile neutropenia before and they got it like three or fourdays. I think the way to think about here is a slightly different one. If a patient had a Grade 3/4 neutropenia in the previous cycle, you would probably like to avoid the situation in subsequent cycles. Because thesepatients are going to have neutropenia key events again. So you try to do what I think in terms of GCSF use you would try to describe as secondary prophylaxis rather than a pure therapeutic use. That'sthe main difference here. If you do this, I think we can bring down the febrile neutropenia rate, which is already low, very substantially. The other side effect of note is gastrointestinal, but most of it is of low grade. That is very different, for example, than when you are thinking aboutirinotecan so -- but that's basically it. And that compares, I think, extremely favorably versus other cytostatics that is out there.",False,True
209,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,"Yes. And then again, thinking about, I guess, a comparator here to the chemo that these patients are getting, what should we be thinking aboutfor a sort of response rate there? Like, sub sort of 20% and just maybe a month or two months of PFS? And again, that's sort of thinking aboutfrontline chemo treatment in TNBC patients and not the four-plus priors the majority of these patients have had to [retrial].",False,True
210,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.","No, I agree with you. And so if we work the way upwards for patients with more than two treatment lines, the literature shows that you can achieveresponse rates of 10% to 15%. We are talking about three times more here and a treatment -- a duration of response of weeks. We are talking aboutmonths. If you work your way upwards, so if you look at the taxanes, which are standard of care in the absence of other opportunities. And by the way, manyof these patients already saw taxanes as part of their adjuvant therapy. So taxanes are not even an option anymore or platinum. In a first-line triple negative metastatic setting, you see round about 30%. Now, that's something you can achieve with sacituzumab or IMMU-132in a third-line-plus setting. In the data set that we had, more than 6% of the patients had more than four prior treatment lines. Every single of thispatient has been treated with taxanes. So that's not even representative of the numbers that I just gave to you. It's an even further down treatmentline. We also had about 20% of the patients who on top of the treatment with multiple lines of chemotherapy had been treated with checkpointinhibitors. Even in that population, we saw a response rate of more than 40%. So I think it's very consistent; it's much, much higher than what you currently see with the so-called standard of care. And as I was trying to say, it'sa very consistent throughout all the subgroups. It is independent of age; it's independent of whether you got three lines or four lines or five lines. It's independent of usage with chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor versus chemotherapy alone. You always end up with this kind of 30% to40% response rate and the majority of patients having some sort of a response. The message here is the benefit of the drug is not driven by a subgroup. It is driven throughout. I think that's a very, very remarkable result whenyou look at how heavily pretreated those patients have been.",False,True
211,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,"And just putting the prior checkpoint treatment into context, I think that exemplifies how desperate these patients really are. Because this isn'texactly an immunologically hot tumor. This is perhaps one of the colder tumor types out there where checkpoints really don't see activity. So putting this into context, what are sort of the next steps and timelines associated with the regulatory submission? What else does need to getdone?",False,True
212,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.","So we communicate in our earnings call that the timeline or the time point of our submission is end of May. We had previously communicated atimeline that was a couple of weeks earlier, but there is some additional work ongoing in terms of assays that the FDA has been asking us to do.And PK work that just needs to be finished and finalized in the right quality and that has shifted the timeline a little bit. The other work stream that is ongoing and where we have really made great progress is process validation. So doing validation runs of the antibody,of the linker, of the conjugation and of the fill/finish. Most of that work is done, so the antibody work is done. The linker work is almost done and we are now doing the last work with our partner BSP in Italy, who does the conjugation fill/finish. So we arereally going to come in very nicely against that timeline. The third major thing for us is preparing for a preapproval inspection. That's what the FDA usually does. That's totally not unusual for our Company.Every company with a biologic gets that.     We hired someone as our head of quality who has eight years of experience as an FDA inspector. She turns basically every stone between NewJersey and New York, I can tell you. And she also brought in a lot of consultants with an FDA background, so we feel that we are extremely wellprepared. Submission is front and center for us without any doubt. But I think we are doing extremely well against the timelines and the work that needs tobe done.",False,True

214,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.","I think it's going to be a reflection of what we've been having with this 110 patients. And again, the data that we showed in San Antonio is exactlythe data that the FDA gets from us. So it's probably fair to say or to assume that it will be patients with three or more treatment lines and patientswho have been pretreated with taxanes. By the way, most of these patients saw taxanes. So that's -- now, the question is what does that mean for usage, right? In terms of usage, I wouldmake an anticipation. And this is where US is very different to Europe. I come from Europe, as you can hear from my strange accent. So in the US,I think, thank God, the usage is driven by medical need and the data that you have at hand. All the key opinion leaders that we talked to told us that there is no difference between the second-line situation and the third-line situation.Patients are as desperate after one treatment line than they are after two treatment lines. There is just nothing available. What that means is, at least in the academic centers, everybody is going to use the drug in the second-line setting right from the get-go. In thecommunity setting, I think it's prudent and important that we are able to include data into the NCCN treatment guidelines. Generating this datais an absolute priority for the Company and we are setting up the respective protocols as we speak. But we think we are going to see a lot of second-line usage right from the get-go, which we are then going to complement with more data in thesecond-line setting. So the data is a reflection of the data but -- the label is a reflection of the data that you have. But I think the usage is going tobe broader right from the get-go.",False,True
215,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,"Yes. And thinking about some of those trials -- again, not registrational trials, but smaller trials that could just help inform usage and get 132 onguidelines. How are you thinking about these? Are these going to be ISTs? And if those are getting set up, why not include some frontline patientsthere?",False,True
216,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.","Yes, so we have a couple of priorities and I'm happy to be able to talk about those. So generating second-line data is a key priority for us, and that'sgoing to be in monotherapy. We are going to not run these as an IST, but rather as a Company-sponsored study because we feel there's also froma translational side there's quite a lot to learn.     We want to much better understand as to why our patients are responding so exclusively well as compared to those who have only a minor or noresponse. We want to understand why patients are relapsing. Is that a chemotherapy-driven event? Does that have to do with loss of antigen orboth? What about certain subgroups? Triple negative breast cancer is not a homogeneous treatment group. There was recent publications showing thatthere's very different molecular subtypes and gene expression profiles. And we just want for kind of the future work that is in front of us, which isfrontline, which is combination, we just want to obtain as much data as we can. So that's one priority. Second priority for us -- and again, we would do this as a Company-sponsored -- is monotherapy and combination in first line. We think in orderto cover triple negative breast cancer completely, we need to do both. Many patients are not going to tolerate a combination therapy, althoughit's probably a safe bet to say that a combination could be more effective. So in order to really own that, space you need to do both. From a data generation perspective, that priority for us, again, means set up a protocol,have it up and running in the next 12 months. We want to generate monotherapy data because ultimately we will have to compare ourselvesdirectly head-to-head versus a platinum or a taxane. And we want to understand what the profile of our drug is as monotherapy. Talking about combination, we have three options here: one is chemo; one is PARP. PARP have been approved now in triple negative breast cancer.Thank God something is approved in that indication, although only for a very, very small subset of patients: 15% of the patients. There is a BRCAmutation part. We think there's an opportunity through the combination to have broad utility for all patients, not just for the BRCA. And then depending on whether PD-1s and PD-L1s, to your point, make it to registration, the Phase 3 trials we are going to see soon, probably thisyear, PD-1 and PD-L1 combinations are also of interest. The third big data generation bucket for us, as you will see -- [I can't say]; we have not talked about that yet -- where we have similarly intriguingdata that we showed last year at the ESMO congress, we make a major effort to update our data with a longer observation period and go intosubgroups and making those data available. But at the same time, we want to set up protocols in anticipation of positive discussion with the authorities. Because we believe there could be apath to accelerated approval as well. And upon advice and input of the regulatory authority, we would set up this protocol to reflect it. And again,this study should be up and running in the next 12 months.",False,True
217,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,"And would love to shift the conversation to urothelial. Before we do, two questions here. One: should we be thinking about a biomarker here? Thisis targeting Trop-2. Do we need to be screening for Trop-2 expression in these patients?",False,True
218,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.","No, we don't. So we are looking for Trop-2 expression because we want to learn. We are not discriminating between patients that have or have notor have high or have moderate or have low. 90% of the patients have a moderate or high expression of Trop-2. There's also -- we have a SPA, agreed protocol with the FDA. That is currently recruiting as our confirmatory study. The FDA has also clearly told usthey don't expect any patient stratification. That said, there is other indications other than triple negative breast cancer, other than breast cancer as such or urothelial cancer, where the Trop-2expression may be lower. We know for example from prostate cancer that Trop-2 expression is around about 70%. And that's when you start toscratch your head and say like maybe I should have a biomarker in the population.     You heard us having a press release by the beginning of 2018 where we said we are working together with the University of Wisconsin. Not justbecause they did some initial encouraging experiments with our drug in advanced prostate cancer, but also because they have some exquisiteexperience to determine Trop-2 expression from circulating tumor cells. So part of the effort that we have to undergo is not just having a validated assay for the future, but ideally to also have this assay from circulatingtumor cells so that we don't have to torture patients anymore by getting tumor samples.",False,True
219,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,"Got you. And so maybe we can move to urothelial now. Again, a very large market, very high unmet need. Perhaps a little bit more crowded thantriple negative breast cancer. We have seen some data from checkpoints here where it's at least look like a rather viable strategy. Can you sort of remind us what the data we've seen to date is in terms of response rates and durability? And then again, thinking about sort of apath forward in urothelial, sort of where we are today?",False,True
220,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.","Happy to do that. So we showed data of 41 patients at the ESMO congress last year. They were all obtained in patients who got -- who were eitherrelapsed or refractory to prior chemotherapy. Round about a third of these patients have received checkpoint inhibitors. And round about a third of the patients had liver mets. That is the worstpopulation of all. The observation period, I have to say, in those patients was still rather short, but still what we were able to show is a 34% responserate, which by the way is higher than what checkpoints achieve in a second-line population. In a second-line population with checkpoint inhibitors, you achieve round about 20% to 25%. We had a higher response rate in a population thatwas much later. Just wanted to make that point.",False,True
221,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Kennen MacKay,RBC Capital Markets,And even lower. I think Otezla was like 27% in I think frontline.,False,True
222,64412466,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Immunomedics Inc at RBC Capital Markets Healthcare Conference,Michael Pehl,"Immunomedics, Inc.","And even in frontline, the results are not very much better. I agree. So that's one thing. We were able to show a 12-months duration of response,which I think, again, for that population is something unheard of. And a progression-free survival of six to seven months. So that's a pretty uniqueprofile. We think this is absolutely a best-in-class asset. That said, the next step for us is to kind of re-analyze the data. That's what we are currently doing because we have a much longer observationperiod now. Go into those subgroups, because it's encouraging to see this kind of response rates and durations overall. But what about the patients that had checkpoint inhibitors, right? Because thinking about an accelerated approval, that's what the Agency is goingto think about. And upon having those data at hand and publishing them. In parallel, of course, as I was trying to say, we are talking to the FDA about give us the exact definition of a patient population where you think anaccelerated path is achievable. And let's set up the protocol that we are working on exactly reflecting that. So that's the first step.     The second step -- and it's not a sequential game here; I think it's a parallel game -- is there is patients, as you know, who are not platinum eligibleand get checkpoint inhibitors right away. So rather than having a second-line population after you have your third-line population, that's thesituation that we have in triple negative breast cancer. We will certainly make an effort to have both of them at the same time. Even though you may not have an approval at hand, in case there is an accelerated path and the data looks good, we just want to broaden ourdatabase right from the get-go. And then, of course, again, same game. You think about frontline. In thinking about frontline, you think about twothings: checkpoint inhibitor combination, chemo combination.

Despite the challenging vehicle production environment in North America, I'm pleased with our overall performance in the quarter acrossseveral key metrics.",False,True
232,64388276,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call,Christian A. Garcia,Visteon Corporation,"Thank you, Sachin, and good morning, everyone. On Page 11, we present our key financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 versusthe comparable periods in 2016. The financials on this page reflect our ongoing Electronics Product Group and exclude discontinued and otheroperations. As explained on prior calls, our financial results in the prior year included businesses that were exited at the end of last year and were classifiedeither in the Other Product Group or discontinued operations. We did not have nor expect to have any sales or adjusted EBITDA related to ourOther Product Group or discontinued operations. Electronic sales of $797 million in the fourth quarter were down by less than 1% from prior year, as a drop in North America production volumeswas offset by growth in other regions. Despite the modest decline in revenues, adjusted EBITDA for electronics was $102 million, representing a4% increase from fourth quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 12.8%, 60 basis points higher than prior year levels and largely reflectsoperating efficiencies across our organization. Since 2015, we've had 12 consecutive year-over-year quarterly improvements on this metric. Adjusted free cash flow for electronics was $58 million in the quarter, $21 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year due to timing of workingcapital payments and higher capital expenditures. I will provide more detail on the full year figures on the following pages. On Page 12, we provide electronic sales and adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 versus 2016. Electronic sales for the full year were $3,146,000,000or 1.3% higher than 2016 as higher volumes offset the impact of pricing. Overall, volumes and mix were up by 4% compared to global productionvolume growth of 2%. As we have indicated during the course of 2017, we continued to generate strong revenues from China. For the full year,our China domestic sales increased by 21%, while China vehicle production volumes grew 2%. We've seen a decoupling of our sales growth fromthe market driven by our new product launches, and we expect China domestic sales to continue to grow at double-digit rate in 2018. Our adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $370 million, which if you recall, is at the top end of our guidance. This represents growth of 7% from 2016 andreflects our continued ability to generate favorable cost performance in engineering, material and manufacturing costs. This cost performance,together with the flow-through of new business more than offset the impact of pricing and unfavorable currency. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.8% for the year and represents an improvement of 70 basis points compared with 2016. Incremental margins,which are the amount of adjusted EBITDA generated for every dollar of increase in sales were over 60%, which indicates our ability to extractoperational efficiencies, while at the same time invest in new technologies and execute on the new programs we have won. Turning to Page 13. Page 13 provides our cash flow. Total adjusted free cash flow for the year was $148 million, lower than prior year driven by thetiming of working capital payments, which will in turn benefit our cash flow in the first quarter of 2018. In fact, our adjusted free cash flow forJanuary, 2018, is one of the highest in many years and should dampen the cash outflow we typically experienced in the first quarters of every year.Capital expenditures came in at a little over 3% of revenues for the full year due to 2 reasons: plant investments to cover our strong new businesswin rate; and the higher capitalization of software development costs as we move toward more platform and software-based technologies. Our returns on invested capital are high, over 19% in 2017, and as such, the best use of our cash is investing in ourselves. Going forward, we estimatethat our capital expenditures will be around 3% of revenues. Free cash flow for total Visteon for the year was $118 million, which is a goodimprovement from 2016 levels of $45 million, as we have completed separation of our legacy businesses. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the year were $709 million, and that was $393 million, which continues to put us in a net cashposition and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.1x. We have a strong capital structure that would enable us to compete effectively and invest in different[shading] technologies while returning capital to our shareholders. Moving to Page 14. I'd like to provide an update on our capital return activities. We have authorization from our board to repurchase a total of $900million in 2 tranches, $400 million authorized in 2017 and $500 million authorized in 2018. For the 2017 buyback program, we have repurchased$200 million in 2017, at an average price of $101 million for approximately 2 million shares. We will be entering into a combination of open market     and accelerated share repurchase programs for the remaining $200 million. In January of 2018, our board has supplemented the 2017 authorizationwith an additional $500 million to be executed through 2020. As such, as of the end of 2017, we have $700 million of outstanding share repurchases.This underscores the confidence we have in our long-term growth prospects and shows our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders.Shareholder distributions will continue to be part of our capital allocation approach going forward, and as the company continues to generatecash, we expect that there will be more opportunities to further return capital to our investors. And finally, last month at the Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry conference, we discussed how we are leveraging our technology leadershipposition in cockpit electronics, as the industry transitions into autonomous driving. In that conference, we provided our 2018 guidance, which weare reaffirming today. We're also reiterating our investment themes. First, our strong new business wins of $7 billion, with the significant awardswe had in infotainment and all-digital clusters give us increased confidence in meeting our overall long-term growth objective. Second, in 2017,we delivered increased margins of 11.8% while investing in new technologies and executing on our program wins, and we continue to generateadjusted free cash flow. And third, we continue to be good stewards of capital. We have executed on $200 million share repurchases in 2017, and we have $700 millionremaining that we will execute between now and 2020.

Or does it relate somehow to a differentcadence, some wins you thought that might land in the first quarter of '18, and in fact, fell in the fourth quarter of '17?

Lawande,Visteon Corporation,"Ryan, first of all, yes, we are very happy with our record setting performance in 2017 with respect to new business wins. What I would say withrespect to our longer-term revenue target is that, this performance increases our confidence, first of all, in achieving that target with the wins thatwe've had in 2017 now, I would say, over more than 60% of the 2021 target of $4.7 billion in revenue is already in our backlog or already sourced.So the way we should think of it is that our confidence in delivering our 2021 revenue target is now significantly higher. Having said that, ourrevenue outlook depends on a few other things, such as vehicle production forecasts as well as currency. So our target for 2018 for new businesswins remains the same, roughly about $6 billion. The sales pipeline looks very strong, so we expect to have another strong year. And as we alwaysdo, we will update our outlook for 2021 at the end of the year and then provide you with an update at the next Deutsche Bank conference. Butoverall, again, a very strong year.

We saw that earlier announcement that you had won that sort of design win for SmartCore in Europe,and without producing all of the associated hardware. And now today, you've got this announcement of a software-only Phoenix win. Can you     kind of talk about the implications of that? Do you prefer to produce the associated hardware also?

Let me talk first about this win and then I'll also invite Christian to talk about the margin. So if you look at the sales cycle for a typical conquestinfotainment win, it's usually more than a year. And so we are very happy to have 2 wins in Phoenix within a year of the launch of the platform. Sothis second win is for an European OEM, and this is for their existing infotainment systems that they wanted to upgrade to be able to host webapps in a downloadable fashion. So we are providing the Phoenix runtime and the studio developer software to enable the OEM and the thirdparties to create downloadable apps for this infotainment system. This is a software-only sale, and as such, the business model relies on a royaltythat we collect on a per unit basis. And since this is an existing infotainment system, the initial start of production is actually Q3 of this year. So it-- I would say, it's a great validation of our software oriented approach to our platforms. It represents an acceleration of revenue and as a software-onlybusiness, the margins are what you'd expect from a software business. Christian, would you like to add something?",True,False

It really is achoice that we don't get to make in most of those cases. This is the OEM in most cases that decides that. We do expect a few other opportunitiesin this way where on account of the installed base of infotainment systems that lack the ability to offer an app environment, there is a demand forthe kind of software that we offer with Phoenix. But in the vast majority of the cases, we expect that the OEMs will want a complete system hardwarealong with the software pre-integrated like what we typically would do in normal business.",True,False

But 2/3 are what you would consider normal CapEx, which is the plant equipment and so forth that we needed to support thenew program wins that we're having. And 1/3 of that is also -- 1/3 of the increase is the software development costs that you talked about.

The way tothink of it is, as you mentioned, we are winning in all of the 3 segments. This is a turnaround year, 2017 was a turnaround year for us in infotainment,and it's really driven on account -- by the fact that we have made some investments in our platforms and then we talked about Phoenix, it scalesreally well from entry infotainment all the way to mid-high and the strength that we have on account of the acquisition of AllGo in our -- thesmartphone projection capabilities, which are very important, not just for display audio segment, but also for embedded.",True,False

257,64388276,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Visteon Corp Earnings Call,Sachin S. Lawande,Visteon Corporation,"Yes, so Joe, first thing I would mention here is that one of the key capabilities in our a all-digital cluster, there are 2 in fact, one is the display, theother is the software. And when it comes to the digital display, Visteon has always had a very strong capability in automotive digital displays. Weship over $400 million worth of digital displays every year. So we have a strong capability in taking LCD panels and then treating them and bondingand fabricating the automotive displays that have to withstand the conditions within the car and meet critical requirements. This is not somethingthat most players in the space have, as a vertically integrated capability. So that's one element of that. The other is the software. And then, so whathas happened here with software is that besides having the key capabilities in terms of the technology, we, at Visteon, have critical mass in termsof supporting the specific vehicle architectures of a wide number of automakers in the world. So we have now a broad-based platform that we cantake to automakers that more than likely supports their requirements out of the box. That's different from, say with many other of our competitors,that reduces the risk to the program, reduces our cost in developing that cluster, and this is one of the main reasons why we have won as muchbusiness as we've won. This is the second year that -- in a row that we have won about $3.8 billion, $3.9 billion in clusters and when you look at themarket, which is on an annual basis, somewhere around $7 billion, it represents a significant market share. So we do expect, however, that as wego forward, more of the automakers to transition towards all-digital.

The shift to all-digital clusters really hit its stride in 2017. And I'm just wondering, since all thedigital clusters require more computing resources and it seems the interaction between the cluster and infotainment is a trend. Can you talk tothe potential for additional SmartCore new business wins in 2018 beyond? And really it's just -- has the bid presence dramatically increased?

So you are absolutely right that this move towards all-digital clusters really drives demand for increased computing resources, includingprocessors, memory and software. And the need is really driven by the sort of the drive towards rendering digital content in the clusters andinformation that comes typically from an infotainment system. As we see more of these types of solutions, that is also a big sort of a driver behindthe integration of infotainment and the cluster because it's a lot more effective to have those 2 systems run off of a single electronic control unitor ECU to be able to share that information seamlessly between the 2 displays. Now as we have, I think, in my prepared script mentioned that themomentum in cockpit domain controllers is also picking up, and the pipeline of new opportunities for 2018 is very robust. In fact, it has never beengreater.

And then let me try to describe to you the way we see the opportunities in autonomous. So if you look at theindustry and some of the things that you're hearing in media, there are really 2 sort of directions that the industry is taking. On one side, there isthis push towards fully autonomous, perhaps in more limited domains intended for application such as robot access and for freight movers intrucks that have a point-to-point limited by sort of a specific geofenced area. So that's one initiative. The other initiative is targeted more towardsconsumer car owners. And in this area, the goal is to upgrade the current Level 1, Level 2 ADAS capabilities into Level 3, more automated driving.So at Visteon, we are really focused on working with our traditional long-term customers in enabling and upgrading Level 1, Level 2 into Level 3.Now the key features there that we expect to be of initial interest would be highway pilot and remote self-parking. So what we are doing now iswe're very focused on developing a very cost-effective solution based on DriveCore that meets the requirements of highway pilot and self-driving.And so this is where we would expect as we go -- as we make more progress in releasing these capabilities and launching these features, we'dexpect to see more business opportunities with OEMs that we have started engagement in. The interest is extremely high. We are just as cautiousin terms of who we work with and who are the right partners for us as much as anything. Because again, there's a lot of activity in this industry inthis regard, at the same time, resources are limited. So we are carefully sorting through the opportunities and making sure that we are partnering     with the right set of OEMs. And we'll update you as we go along but so far, we have talked publicly about GAC and we are in discussions with afew others in parallel at the same time.",True,False

If you think about the margin progression,from where we are to the 14% target that we've communicated, the fixed cost leverage will happen towards the back end of that as we get -- aswe translate or generate the revenues from our backlog. And so that would come in later. The other one is the shift to lower software andplatform-based offerings. It's still quite nascent.

So I would expect that we would see a pickup in new business activity for those 2 products. With respect to DriveCore, again,it's relatively new for us and for the industry. So there's a lot of discussions that need to happen and business models that need to evolve. So Iwould say that, that is still in a prebusiness-development phase. I would expect more sort of a pick up to offer perhaps later in the year or earlynext.",True,False

I'd like to thank you all for joining the PRA Health Sciences conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and fullyear 2017 financial results. I'm pleased to report that the fourth quarter of 2017 was another strong quarter with double-digit revenue, adjusted net income and net newbusiness growth. Service revenues for the fourth quarter were approximately $569 million, which represents an increase of approximately 38%year-over-year at actual foreign exchange rates and 36% on a constant currency basis. Service revenues, excluding Symphony, increased approximately20% year-over-year at actual foreign exchange rate and 19% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter wasapproximately $69 million, an increase of approximately 50% over the same period last year. Our adjusted net income per diluted share was $1.04,a 47% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Net new business increased approximately 10% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. We had a record of $647 million of net new businessawards, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.3x of Service revenue, and this is despite unusually high cancellations of $132.6 million during thequarter. The addition of our new awards has resulted in our backlog increasing approximately 4% on a sequential basis and 20% year-over-year,finishing at approximately $3.5 billion. We will not be including our Data Solutions segment in our reported new business awards and backlog due to the short-term nature of thesecontracts. The diversity of our new business awards continues to be consistent with previous quarters with approximately 60% of our new awardscoming from the pharmaceutical sector and approximately 40% coming from the biotechnology sector. Our client base also continues to be welldiversified with our top 5 clients representing approximately 37% of our total revenue for the quarter, with our largest client representingapproximately 9% of total revenue. Our full year 2017 financial results continued a trend of consistent and strong growth. We reported solid revenue growth and improved our overalloperating margins. With our full year service revenues of approximately $1.9 billion, representing growth of approximately 23% on an actual andconstant currency basis. Revenue growth, excluding Symphony Health, was approximately 18% at actual rates and approximately 17% on constantcurrency basis. During 2017, we made significant investments in our business and expanded our Service offerings. We believe that we've established a foundationthat will allow us to provide long-term sustainable growth. I believe we are well positioned to offer a wide variety of services to our clients. Ouracquisition of Symphony Health has gone very well and I am delighted with the performance. We look forward to the continued opportunities thatthis strategic acquisition will provide in the future. During Q1 2018, we'll be formally finalizing our integration plan and will be working on completing integration by the end of 2018. Due to oursolid performance in 2017, we are anticipating our 2018 diluted adjusted earnings per share to be between $4 per share and $4.15 per share. Asdiscussed in our press release, this guidance includes the impact of adopting the new revenue standard, the impact of the enactment of the TaxCuts and Jobs Act and updated foreign exchange rates become estimates. Linda will provide additional details about our 2018 guidance later inthe call. In closing, I would like to thank our entire staff and our clients for their continued commitment to PRA Health Sciences.

291,64388292,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 PRA Health Sciences Inc Earnings Call,Linda Baddour,"PRA Health Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Colin. Good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2017, our consolidated service revenues grew 37.5% at actual foreign exchangerate and 35.9% on a constant currency basis. We reported $568.8 million of service revenue for the quarter compared to $413.6 million for the samequarter last year. As Colin mentioned earlier, PRA revenue, excluding Symphony Health, increased 20.2% year-over-year at actual foreign exchangerate and 18.6% on a constant currency basis. Revenue by segment for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $497.3 million for the clinical research segment and $71.5 million for the data solutionssegment. Revenue concentrations, excluding our Data Solutions segment revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2017 was consistent with prior quarters.We derived approximately 56% of our Service revenue from large pharmaceutical companies, approximately 14% from the small-to-midsizepharmaceutical companies, approximately 16% from large biotechnology companies and approximately 14% from all other biotechnologycompanies. Total direct costs were $368.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $274.4 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in directcosts was primarily related to an increase in labor-related costs in our Clinical Research segment as we continue to hire billable staff to support ourcurrent portfolio of studies and our future growth. Our Data Solutions segment reported $40.2 million of direct costs in the fourth quarter of 2017.Total direct costs were 64.9% of Service revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 66.3% in the same quarter last year. The decrease indirect costs as a percentage of Service revenue, is primarily due to the higher gross margins in our Data Solutions segment Service offeringscompared to our Clinical Research Service offerings. On a constant currency basis, total direct costs increased by $86.6 million year-over-year. Thisincrease in our cost base included an unfavorable foreign currency effect of $7.9 million when compared to 2016. SG&A expenses were $92.2 million or 16.2% of Service revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 17% of Service revenue for the samequarter last year. A decrease in SG&A as a percentage of Service revenue, is related to our continued efforts to effectively leverage our selling andadministrative functions. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we incurred transaction-related expenses of $75.9 million, which were primarily relatedto changes in the fair value of earn-out liabilities associated with our acquisitions. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we also incurred $13 millionof transaction-related costs. These costs were primarily related to nonrecurring stock-based compensation expense, and the vesting of certainperformance-based options related to our November 2016 secondary offering. Adjusted net income, which excludes... (technical difficulty) ...items whose fluctuation from period to period does not necessarily correspond to changes in our operating results, increased 49.9% year-over-yearto $68.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income per diluted share grew 46.5% to $1.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017compared to $0.71 per share in the same quarter last year. For the 12 months ending 12/31/2017, our Consolidated Service revenues grew approximately 23% at actual foreign exchange rates on a constantcurrency basis. We finished the year with approximately $1.9 billion of Service revenues compared to $1.6 billion in the comparable prior year. PRArevenue, excluding Symphony Health, increased approximately 18% year-over-year at actual foreign exchange rates and approximately 17% on aconstant currency basis. Cash provided by operations was $102.6 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2017, compared to cash provided by operations of $93.3million for the same period of 2016. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operations was $220.4 million compared to$160 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in operating cash flow was the result of an increase in our operational performance, reducedinterest payments and optimization of our working capital. Our net days sales outstanding was 20 days at December 31, 2017, compared to 19 days at December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures were $22million for the fourth quarter compared to $7.5 million for the same period of 2016. Capital expenditures were $61.3 million for the 12 monthsended December 31, 2017 compared to $33.1 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016.     the seasonality in our data solutions segment and the negative impact of first quarter recurring expenses, such as payroll taxes and employeebenefits and expenses incurred related to internal organizational meetings. Finally, our guidance assumes a euro exchange rate of $1.25 and a British pound exchange rate of 1.37. All other foreign currency exchange ratesare as of January 31, 2018. Our process for determining exchange rates is consistent with prior years, where we use several bank resources toevaluate expected rate movements for the next 12 months.

I'm wondering if you can provide any color around those.Were those studies that you had assigned some risk adjustment to as your practices typically do?

But that's -- actually was more of a -- the client's -- during our reprioritization, wherethere were -- one was a change in the [current outcome] of the study that either -- whether it's regulatory or -- and as -- looks as if it'll be comingback later on in the year. We just don't know when. And we prudently have -- take as a cancellation. There was another one where we decided todo a different study within the portfolio and reprioritize. So that's changing again. It'll be coming back in the future. And we also saw a little bit uptrend. There was a few slippages as we were going through Q1. And so we wanted to deflect being -- but prudent in our forward-looking, particularlyin Q1, because we did expect a few other studies to be up and running much, much more quicker. So Dave, I think the best protection we can haveis continuing to have a well-diversified portfolio. We have got a significant number of clients. Typically, we have been fortunate enough that whenthings are slipping, other things are accelerating. It just seems that the last quarter things were all going in the one direction which was a lot moreon the negative side. And saying that, we felt very good about everything. Has allowed us to be careful in our hiring. And actually go through andaddress areas where we've got a little bit of overstaff and watching -- and go about pruning.

We never know exactly which countryare going to be utilized, which therapeutic area of expertise. And so we try to obviously try -- look at the portfolios and try to make sure that for allof our key clients we get the right people in the right places at the right time. Sometimes that gets a little bit out of sync and then we address thatperiodically. Obviously, this -- a little bit of slippage here. We've had some cancellations and some projects waiting has given us an opportunity tojust reassess. We're still -- obviously got to hire for all the new studies coming onboard.

And what I was coming up with was an EBITDA margin under ASC 606 or something like 15% to 16% for the full yearwith that being materially lower in the first quarter, and then stepping up meaningfully through the year. I guess, a, is that the right way to look atit? And then if not, could you maybe help us out with kind of what you're thinking about for interest expense and some of the other below-the-lineitems, any other -- other expenses might be factored into the model that would help us triangulate better on the -- on what the EBITDA margin isgoing to look like?",True,False

And then you -- of course, you've got yourPTO accruals that kick in, your payroll taxes and we're -- or 89% payroll expense with our company, so anytime you have a big movement in thatin the beginning, it affects your profitability. And then finally, we are actually, as Colin mentioned, we still have to hire up in certain areas of thebusiness. And then in other areas, we may have it -- to a lesser extent, we are evaluating, maybe looking at some -- not -- slowing down the hiring.So -- but I get that the profitability in Q1 is primarily -- and also with our Data Solutions segment, there is a very slow quarter for that particularbusiness unit.",True,False

You had guided to$60 million at the midpoint. So obviously, pretty massive upside. My question is how sustainable is that in 2018? Should we model growth off thisspace for the fourth quarter of '18? Or maybe step-up our quarters throughout the year?

It's -- they -- our clients typically will [rewind] it most of thedata towards the end of a year. And you're not going to see at fourth quarter a performance at all the time.

I obviously don't want to interfere with that earn-out, which is why we're going to be taking it a littlebit slowly during the year, and doing it in a much more deliberate fashion.

365,64388628,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call,Mark C. Allen,Denbury Resources Inc.,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning. My comments today will highlight some of the financial items in our release, primary focusing on the sequentialchanges from the third quarter, and I will also provide some forward-looking guidance to help you in updating your financial models. Starting on Slide 15. We are extremely pleased with our financial results this quarter as our continued efforts on cost reductions, efficiency andexecution are starting to shine through. On an adjusted basis, net income was $48 million for the fourth quarter, up from $14 million in the third quarter, with the increase mostly drivenby higher revenues. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $127 million, with the primary differences being a $78 million adjustment fornoncash mark-to-market commodity derivative changes and a one-time deferred tax benefit of $132 million, reflecting the re-measurement ofdeferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Turning to Slide 16. Our non-GAAP adjusted cash flow from operations, which excludes working capital changes improved to $134 million for thefourth quarter, nearly doubling from the third quarter, again, driven primarily by higher revenues. Our fourth quarter average realized oil price before hedges were $57 per barrel, a 20% increase from our realized price in the prior quarter. Whenyou include the impact of our hedges, the per barrel realized oil price increased 16% from the prior quarter as our combined revenues and commodityderivative settlements increased by $46 million. Slide 17 provides a summary of our oil price differentials, which is our average realized oil prices relative to NYMEX prices. Our oil price differentialimproved by over $2 per barrel from last quarter, which on its own equates to an $11 million uplift in revenues. Our overall differential of a $1.70 above NYMEX prices is the best differential we have realized since the second quarter of 2013. This improvementwas generally related to an expanding premium for light Louisiana sweet oil, which averaged over $5 per barrel above NYMEX prices in Q4, trackingsimilarly to the increase in Brent prices. Approximately 2/3 of our production has an LLS index component included in its price formula. We havealso seen our CCA and Rockies price differential improve to the best levels since we began operations there in 2010. On the bottom portion of this slide, you can see the movement in the LS premium over the last few years and the LS future's basis differentials forthe remainder of 2018. As you can see, the LS premium has pulled back significantly from recent highs and is trending in the positive $2 to $2.50range. I'll review our hedging positions on our next slide but as I had mentioned on last quarter's call, we previously took advantage of the opportunitiesto lock in LLS to WTI basis swaps at an average premium above $4 per barrel to the first half of 2018 to capture a portion of this strong premium. With the LS premium trending down throughout 2018, we expect that our overall oil differential, excluding hedges, will also trend lower. Currently,we anticipate that our overall differential for the first quarter of 2018 will be in the positive $0.75 to $1 range, and for the second to fourth quarters,we are currently anticipating our oil differential to be in a range of flat with NYMEX to a positive $0.50. Slide 18 provides a summary of our oil price hedges. Since our last quarter's conference call, we added 2018 hedges covering 10,000 barrels perday of NYMEX and LLS-fixed price swaps. Our hedges now represent approximately 65% to 70% of our currently anticipated 2018 production levels.For 2019, we have begun to layer in a combination of fixed-price swaps and three-way collars. Our initial hedging objectives for 2019 [will] protect$55 and provide upside exposure to the mid-60s with collars and protect close to $60 with swaps. We plan to continue to add to our 2019 hedgesover the course of the year depending on market conditions. Moving to the next slide. I'd like to review some of our expense line items, starting the G&A. Our G&A expense was $21 million for Q4, 25% lowerthan the third quarter and the lowest quarterly level in 9 years. In the lower right-hand portion of this slide, you can see our G&A per BOE, which was $3.64 per BOE in Q4, the lowest level we have had in quitesome time. Our G&A is now beginning to reflect the significant cost reductions implemented in the third quarter. Our net G&A related to stock-based     And now I'll turn it back to John for some closing comments.",False,True

369,64388628,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call,Christian S. Kendall,Denbury Resources Inc.,"Tim. So the way back I think about these, first of all, it's just such a great target upwards of 300 million barrels of potentially EOR resource up there,which is well in excess of our total current proved reserve base. So it's something that you really want to chase after. And what we're doing, eventhrough the downturn, we've kept the permitting process, which is really the main time impact on the whole project. We've kept that runningthrough the downturn. And I think, what I see us heading towards is a confluence of getting the permitting resolved to a point where we canproceed, and we're feeling pretty good about that in the first part of this year. Getting the technical work and getting that piece of done, and that'severy bit of that that I've seen as we've come through the last couple of quarters, is starting to come to a head. Again, with this objective of gettingthat landed in the first half of this year. And then, the project work and taking into account some of the learnings that we've picked up over thelast few years and reducing -- optimizing the cost of our facilities and making a fit for purpose-type of development on the facility side. That's allcoming together, very focused on getting that decided the first half of this year. And then what I see is that would put us in a position to have thepipe, which is a major single investment late in 2019, get injection started in '20 and then see first production in '21. So that's the framework thatwe're seeing there, Tim. And I think that, at least everything I've seen so far, is very positive.",True,False

And so partof the process we're working through the same time is exactly that, is looking at different paths for bringing in some outside capital for doing that.And as you mentioned, that is a great type of business that, I think, people are interested in investing in.

And then, perhaps, this is a related topic. You talked about marketing some of your mature assets. It looks likeproduction a little over 7,000 a day on that.

373,64388628,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call,Christian S. Kendall,Denbury Resources Inc.,"I see them as separate decisions, Tim. That really -- looking at our portfolio is something that we should be doing every quarter, every year, andmaking sure that our portfolio makes the most sense for our priorities and where we want to deploy our capital and, honestly, just our focus. Sothey are separate, but I do see that at the end of the day, we're -- there's going to be a question of proceeds from that sale, what are you going todo with those? And we're very open with where that'd be deployed, whether it's into reducing debt, into the assets and something like CCA ordoing something else with it. But that is a possibility, but they were arrived at separately really just makes sense for us to look at these assets andget our portfolio as optimized as we can.",True,False

If I could switch, and this may be a better question for Mark. The 4Q '17, the unit expense profile was very strong. But if -- I can understandit from the prepared comments, you expect LOE to up to about $0.50. Should we think about that as $0.50 from the full year 2017 average, whichgets us closer to kind of a 21 level? Or is that from the 4Q '17 kind of level?",True,False

We see it landing around there. Obviously, there's a lot to be gained from continuedfocus at the field level on what we can do to improve that, and we're continuing to work other paths to improving it. Honestly, optimizing ourportfolio will do that to some degree, growing our production will do it to another back. But to frame that, I think, you're right looking at the fullyear.",True,False

377,64388628,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call,Mark C. Allen,Denbury Resources Inc.,"So what -- the way we think about the real estate sale in Houston, Tim, is 2 distinct parts. First, the area in Conroe there that's near The Woodlands,south of the town of Conroe. And that is one main parcel or one main piece of real estate that's broken up into 7 parcels. And all of those parcelsare going out for an RFP on March 1 of this year. So just a couple of weeks from now. And we expect to have bids in that by the end of March andsee some notional -- we expect to get some purchase and sale agreements executed in the second quarter. So that's something that, I think, you'dsee something from us in the second quarter. Then as we move south to Webster, that this multiple different parcels. Just the nature of their realestate there along the frontage road, on I-45 going down to Galveston, there are many different nice things we can do with the -- with that propertyand that will be something that I think you'll see starting to come in over the course of '18, and might even be beyond that. But there's a lot ofinterest, a lot of good things happening there. Kind of 2 different things. A big piece in Conroe that we'll see some numbers on in the second quarterand then the rest of it in Webster that will happen throughout the year here.",True,False

So we have 1 well that's been producing for really less than 2 months now.Certainly, we're pleased with what we've seen. We want to get more time with the well that we've drilled. We want to get more wells drilled andget some production history behind there. If you look at the map that we've provided for the Mission Canyon area that we're drilling right now, asI mentioned, we've already spudded the second well on that same structure. And we really don't see anything different that we expect in the next2 wells in terms of where we are geologically and what we're looking for. It's more of just testing the same concept and the same accumulationand establishing some production history. As we move outside of the Pennel and Coral Creek area, which is one of these first wells will be, thenthere're some different ideas that we're going to be testing, but again, all of it is generally the same concept with this fairly narrow interval ofMission Canyon.

Yes our leverage metrics have been higher than we would like and we're starting to see those move here in the right direction.With cost reductions and prices, which is, I think one very positive sign and I think over the last few years, our bank group has continued to workwith us quite well and we just -- we're confident in how we're going to move forward here.",True,False

I'm curious if you can talk about what the, what kind of decline profile you're seeing and you expect to see in this well?When I just look at your current EOR and the rate, the way those 2 fit together make it seem like it's a pretty high decline well. But I wanted to justtest that because we've gotten to the point -- we've answered the question about or maybe addressed the question of how repeatable that is, butalso how good is this? So can you talk about how -- what you're seeing in 2 months of decline on this?",True,False
391,64388628,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Denbury Resources Inc Earnings Call,Christian S. Kendall,Denbury Resources Inc.,"You bet. So what I'd say, Charles, is that first of all, that the EOR that you had seen that we disclosed publically was a predrill expectation so there'sgoing to be some adjustment to that as we go. I would still say it's early days on how this behaves. But if you think about just the nature of puttinga long lateral in a pretty thin reservoir, we'd expect it to behave, honestly, more like an unconventional well where you have some fairly high initialdecline rates. We're going to keep watching that. We're not to the point where we have enough of a track record out here with it to really talk intoo much detail. But what I would say, look at it to be along the lines of what you'd expect more in the unconventional side with the benefit ofthese wells being that we are completing open hole without of frac and the cost associated with that.",True,False

So what's interesting about that and it's even -- it even applies back to the Mission Canyon, Charles, is that these -- certain of these reservoirs,when we produce them on primary, when that's complete, they set themselves up very nicely for CO2. And that's the case with Mission Canyon,and that'll be the same for Perry. With the Perry, it's an area of the Tinsley Field that we don't have perm for traditional vertical wells to really do agreat job of sweeping with EOR so we have a lot of residual oil left in that horizon. And that's why we're going to attack this one with the horizontalsagain. We are going to have to put a bit of a frac in these, we think, to get the rates that we want. So it'll be a little different, although just if youkind of balance the whole nature of the -- of that field and the depth of the reservoir, our well costs are going to be in the same ballpark as whatyou saw with Mission Canyon.",True,False

Obviously, we've hit on cost reductions. We've done some exchanges,utilizing our capital structure and the flexibility that it has provided. I think we still have some flexibility remaining there. We have some newinstruments in the last exchanges in the form of converts, which could provide some optionality, and we'd like to see those convert here at somepoint. But we still think what really drives our ability forward here is obviously, we're doing a lot of great things on our operations side, we havesome new projects, but more than that is really just getting back to the sustaining nature of our reserves and the fact that our reserve basis is verydesirable, it doesn't deplete rapidly over time.

Did some creative nice work to continue to grow production from the initial phases. ThenPhase 5, we expect to start to see the response. We actually have it completed, as I mentioned, and we're injecting, and we have the initial response,which is, essentially, water production that's very strong. It looks good to us.

415,64388865,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Leonard A. Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,"Thank you, Carol, and good morning. We're continuing to work with Apollo on completing the sale of Qdoba, which we're expecting will occur byApril, though we will not be discussing that brand's performance during our comments this morning. As for Jack in the Box, our financial performancein the first quarter was solid overall and in line with our expectations. System same-store sales decreased slightly in Q1 as we rolled over a 3.1%increase last year, which was our best quarter of fiscal 2017. But we saw a sequential improvement in both sales and traffic in Q1, and importantly,company restaurant margins remained strong as a result of our refranchising efforts, which offset both commodity and wage inflation. In addition,G&A continued to decline as we focus on becoming a more nimble organization. This morning, I'd like to talk about some of the restaurant initiatives underway to drive traffic and sales, and to update you on some leadershipchanges at our company, as well as how I see the flattening of our organizational structure impacting G&A. When it comes to service improvements,whether we're enhancing our restaurant facilities or developing digital solutions, it's imperative that we meet our guest's evolving expectations.Within our restaurants, we believe there are ways to find efficiencies to ensure that our 4 walls economics makes sense for our franchisees overthe long term. Though we'll be working with them to accelerate the testing of several pieces of new equipment and processes. As for digital, we know that if it adds complexity to our operations, we've made a mistake. The app we've been successfully testing does exactlywhat consumers want today. They can easily view our menu, order, schedule pickup and pay. We also want to be able to easily integrate otherfeatures with the app when appropriate, such as delivery. We're heading in the right direction with our app, and we believe we'll be in a positionto roll it out systemwide by the end of the year. Next, innovation. In the past, you've seen us focus most of our menu innovation around premium products, like the ribeye burger, which helpeddrive sales in Q1, or the food truck sandwiches that Martha Stewart helped us launch during this month's Super Bowl. What you'll see going forward,is that we're going to continue to innovate our own premium products, but also value-based products. The $2 breakfast pockets that we promotedin Q1 as a secondary value message are a great example of being in your value messaging to the menu with a completely new item. When it comes to value, we typically offered value bundles that are promoted via second-tier messaging to the marketplace. However, in January,we began promoting several bundled offerings ranging from $1 to $5 price points as our primarily media message. Most of the traffic loss in Q1continue to be driven by transactions less than $5, but our value promotions, including the $2 breakfast pockets, helps drive an incrementalimprovement in under $5 transactions versus Q4.     Delivery is another important initiative that we're making great progress on. Since the end of Q4, we've expanded the delivery to include anadditional 478 restaurants. We're now delivering Jack in the Box food from nearly 63% of our system. And we're expecting additional restaurantsto begin offering delivery over the course of the year. We continue to see an incremental sales lift in markets where delivery is offered. Another major restaurant initiative is elevating the brand image though remodels and new construction. We have about 600 restaurants that I'dkindly describe as mature. These restaurants typically have roof lines more than 40 years old, that date the branch and really need to change. Theinvestments that we'll make will largely be tiered, depending on sales levels, meaning locations with lower AUVs will get less investment thanthose with higher AUVs. You'll see us in partnership with our franchisees implemented over the next 4 years. Moving on to refranchising. We sold 22 Jack in the Box restaurants to franchisees during first quarter, bringing the system to nearly 89% franchisedat quarter end. We have approximately 60 restaurants with signed LOIs, and continue to expect the Jack in the Box franchise mix will reachapproximately 95% by the end of fiscal 2018. This morning, I'd like to update you on the leadership changes we recently announced, and our plans to continue flattening the organization aswe evolve our company. Our leadership team is already looking different from what it was at the beginning of the year. Earlier this month, FrancesAllen resigned after leading the brand as President for more than 3 years. She anticipated the need to flatten the organization, and graciouslysuggested that the elimination of her position, so that we can more quickly begin restructuring the brand (inaudible). Another important change was the addition of Marcus Tom, who joined us this month as Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Marcus bringssignificant restaurant industry experience in operations leadership position, and will be a key piece of our refocused executive team. And finally, I want to acknowledge that this will be Jerry Rebel's final call with us. As you know, Jerry informed us last year of his desire to retire andmove to Texas so that he could be closer to his family. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Jerry for nearly 15 years of service to the company,and to wish him all the best in honing his golf game in Texas.",False,True

Lance will be joining us from Papa John's International, where he is currently Senior VicePresident, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer. Following the expected sale of Qdoba, we'll still need to provide services to thatbrand until it becomes completely independent. When that happens, we'll be in a better position to continue restructuring the company and focusexclusively on the Jack in the Box brand. As we continue to restructure the business, we believe we can lower G&A to less than 2% of systemwide sales. As we approach the back half of theyear, we expect to be ready to discuss the timing of G&A reductions and other long-term guidance, including free cash flow targets. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry for a more detailed look at the first quarter and an update on guidance for the year. Jerry?",False,True
418,64388865,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Jerry P. Rebel,Jack in the Box Inc.,"Thank you, Lenny, and good morning, everyone. As we noted in the press release, there were several items that made this quarter a bit messierthan usual. When you get beyond the noise, it was relatively clean quarter from an operating standpoint. But before I get into the operating results,I will quickly summarize the items that created the noise. First of all, Qdoba results are shown as discontinued operations for all periods presented,including the Qdoba direct level G&A. However, shared service G&A, which supports both the Jack in the Box brand and the Qdoba brand, remainsin continuing operations.     Second, was the impact of tax reform, which lowered our statutory federal tax rate but resulted in a one-time noncash charge, relating primarilyto the revaluation of our deferred tax assets. This negatively impacted GAAP EPS by $1.03 per share. Third, there was an accounting change thatrequires us to now treat excess tax benefits from share-based compensations as a component of the tax provision versus additional paid-in capitalin the past. This positively impacted GAAP EPS by $0.03 per share. And lastly, with the increasing focus on EBITDA, we have reclassified all depreciation and amortization to a separate line on the P&L. You can seehow this impacted our previously reported metrics, including restaurant operating margins and franchise margin in the non-GAAP reconciliationsincluded in the press release. Moving on to our operating results for the quarter. Operating EPS was $1.23 as compared to $1.07 last year, driven primarily by a lower tax rate, areduction in the share count and a decrease in G&A, which were partially offset by the impact of refranchising. The tax act reduced our federalstatutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, resulting in a blended statutory federal rate of 24.5% for each quarter of our fiscal year,including state taxes, our adjusted Q1 effective tax rate was 28.8% and our estimated tax rate for the fiscal year will be approximately 29%. Jack in the Box system same-store sales declined 0.2% in Q1. This 0.2% -- the 0.2% increase in company same-store sales was comprised of pricingof approximately 1.6%, mixed benefits of 1% and a decline in transactions of 2.4%. Franchise same-store sales declined 0.3% for the quarter. Jackin the Box company restaurant margins of 22.2% increased by 60 basis points compared to last year, with wage and commodity inflation eachabove 5% in the quarter. Restaurant operating margin for the stores we intend to keep after refranchising is complete, was 24.6% in the quarter.Excluding depreciation, company restaurant level EBITDA increased by 20 basis points to 26%. Franchise EBITDA increased by 8.5% to $76 million, due primarily to refranchising. In G&A, excluding depreciation, declined to approximately 2.4%of systemwide sales as compared to 2.7% last year. Our leverage ratio was approximately 3.3x as of the end of the quarter. We are working withour advisors to adjust our capital structure to reflect a less capital-intensive business model. As we said previously at a 95% franchise mix, we arecomfortable taking our leverage up to 5x EBITDA as opposed to the 4x we are limited to under our current credit facilities. Although we did notrepurchase any shares during the quarter, weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 8% versus last year's first quarter. We have approximately$181 million remaining share repurchase authorization from our Board, and we plan to resume buying back our stock. Moving on to guidance. Our systemwide sales guidance range for the second quarter is down 1% to up 1%. Through the first 4 weeks of our secondquarter we are tracking within the range guided. Fiscal year guidance we provided at ICR, and January is unchanged. That concludes our prepared remarks. I'd like to turn the call over to our operator to open it up for questions. Teresa?",False,True

I think you would expect to have some update from us, assuming like you said,the -- the day the transaction closes in April, I would expect that you'd see something in terms of capital structure within the May meeting, and Ithink Lenny will take the second part of that question.",True,False
422,64388865,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Leonard A. Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,"Yes. If we look at long-term guidance overall and any update to -- with our strategic planning, what you can expect to see happen is in conjunctionwith Lance joining the company at the end of the March time frame, the closing of Qdoba in April, you'll see a sense of urgency from us to updatethose plans and be able to get information out to all of you as soon as possible. But we do want to take one step at a time, get our new CFO inposition and work through the close which is targeted for April, but we'll make sure that, that happens before we update any long-term plans. Soyou'll see, as you've seen in the past from us, whether it be with a restructuring or G&A reduction effort, a sense of urgency on our part to movequickly, to get to our new state.",True,False

And just last question, can you just talk a little bit more about your same-store sales guidance of 1% to 2%, what's driving that full yearoutlook, given it is better than the flattish 1Q results and kind of the flattish 2Q guide, and just any comments on how your single price point valuestrategy is going would be helpful.",True,False
424,64388865,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Leonard A. Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,"Yes, let me handle the single price point strategy. It's -- I would call it a tactic more than a strategy. We had major competitive activity in, particularlyin January that we wanted to make sure we were proactive in addressing versus, wait until the end of the quarter to see how it played out. So, Imean the tactic worked well for us, something that we'll repeat if necessary in the future, but it won't be the only tactic, so. And I don't believe thatwill be consistent with a multiple price point value promotion going forward, but it certainly has shown us that we have some other tools in thetool belt that we can pull out when necessary. Beyond that, when you look at the confidence for the back half of the year, I'd say is, I've just spentthe last 2 days and what's interesting about what I'm about to say is, it's fun being a CEO of this company, it's been a great company to work for,but one of the things I've missed the last few years is my involvement in the day-to-day operations and marketing decisions which, with Frances'departure, I'm now extremely involved in and getting more intimate with. And the last couple of days I've had a lot of fun with my franchisees inthe kitchen, working alongside my marketing group and my R&D group to shore up the back half of this year's marketing calendar. And we lookat what we're going to do in Q3, we've got 2 great offerings. One would be a completely new offering that the we've tested, it's a snack item thatwill come in at a lower price point, but it's a nice quantity of food with pretty exciting packaging and also very indulgent line of products. So we'lloffer that. And then on top of that we've got a great bundle item that we'll put together. We're not sharing specifically what we're going to do atthis time, for competitive reasons, but we're all excited about the line up in that quarter, and in addition to that, the franchisees agreed to havethe entire system focus on an average check builder, that we'll be doing through upscaling at every restaurant. It will be some items on our menuthat are unique to Jack in the Box. So when we get the type of engagement from our operators, it's reason to be optimistic and excited. And thenin the last quarter of the year, we're going to move away from sandwiches and promote some of the things that we think we have a license topromote, as a QSR player that has a pretty huge variety on its menu. And so we're going to do things that are differentiated and that make us standout and we're going to actually extend one of the offerings that we currently have to bring some new news and excitement to an old product. Soreally excited about that, we're going to bundle that as well in a combo meal. And again, when you look at what will be in that combo, besides forthe drink, the other items that will be in that combo are unique to Jack in the Box, so. When we look at a lineup like that, and engagement fromour operators, this is where we get excited about the back half of the year.",True,False

Lenny, just wondering if you could talk a bit more, maybe about franchisee sentimentand profitability right now, maybe some of the perceptions around the new value construct, what they're saying? And then, just building that onthat, just as it relates to what you're seeing from a development commitment standpoint? I know there was some commentary, but just how you'rethinking about that associated with the refranchisings as we go through the year?",True,False
428,64388865,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Leonard A. Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,"Yes. So I'll answer the last part of your question first. When we look at the refranchising effort that we're currently initiating, there may be somedevelopment agreements that happened with that but that's not the major thrust of that activity. So unlike what we did last year, where we actuallyslowed down the refranchising activity in order to get development deals signed, this won't look a little different. So we may marginally get some,an uptick in development, but I wouldn't expect that to be a major driver of our business. When you look at franchisee sentiment, essentially, whatthey're experiencing is rising labor costs and it's putting pressure on their P&Ls, and their major focus is really to drive sales and transactions, toallow them to lever their business positively. So we, and -- I'm not -- that's one of the reasons why I've been excited to get close to the businessand close to them, in working through those issues. So again, I said, when you see the type of engagement we experienced over the last 2 days, Imean it was beyond just the back half of the year, it was also examining what the product pipeline would and could look like going forward into2019. I would say that our franchisees are optimistic about the future, but also concerned about their current financial health and want to makesure that the franchise owner is working side-by-side with them, to ensure that they will have a healthy business over the long term. As far as -- one last thing with the franchisees. As far as their interest in refranchising, that has not waned, and their overall financial health is good,but they certainly don't want to see any deterioration in their margin over time, but we still have a significant interest in -- from our franchisees ingetting the remaining sites that we'll be refranchising.",True,False

430,64388865,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,John Stephenson Glass,"Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just first on the current -- the commentary on the current trends, I think you're rolling over some fairly weak comparisons from a year ago. So maybeyou could just remind us how the quarter, a year ago progressed? And therefore, if you've faced other comparisons in the back half just of thisquarter, how you plan to handle that? And Lenny, I think in your comments, you talked about tactics in January sort of like, it was contained toJanuary from a competitive intensity standpoint. You don't necessarily have to be as intense going forward. Is that the case? Do you feel like thediscounting intensity has waned as we've gotten into February? Or is that -- was that not a correct read of that.",True,False
431,64388865,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Leonard A. Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,"I don't think the discounting intensity has waned, but I think we're seeing a couple of things that would tell us it may wane. So first off, whathappened in January was really just us playing a little bit of defense and making sure that we didn't get caught standing flat-footed in the face ofwhat we knew to be is a pretty extensive, competitive activity. I don't think that the activity is necessarily going to wane overall. But the tactics thatwe may deploy against it may be a little different. Our franchisees, what they're seeing is that when we launch premium products well, that's a     transaction driver, and it's also a sales driver. And so for them, it's really important that there's a balance over time, as it is for us, the balance overtime and focusing on value and premium. And in many cases, we found that when we lean into premium, such as when we launched the ButteryJack, we actually are getting more success with that than what seems to be a more [possessive] play when we lean into value. So I think you'regoing to see a healthy balance going forward. When you look at Q1 transactions for our company stores, it improved from down 5.4% to down2.4%, so we think what we did was the right thing, to sort of protect our business and regain some share. But ultimately, when you look at the trendthroughout this quarter and into the back half of the year, with the lineup that we have in place, we remain optimistic that we can deliver.",True,False
432,64388865,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,John Stephenson Glass,"Morgan Stanley, Research Division","In this comment about the second quarter a year ago, when I think you were down like 3% this time a year ago, so you're rolling over easiercomparisons, how does that rest of that quarter unfold? And are you already lapping tougher compares, if you will, so that you've got betterconfidence of that 0 or plus or minus 1?",True,False
433,64388865,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Carol A. DiRaimo,Jack in the Box Inc.,"Yes. So John, the trends that we're tracking in the guidance, that is range versus that down 3%. So there was a lot of chatter last year this time aboutthe delay in tax refunds and from what we can see thus far this year, there hasn't been any improvement or degradation in those trends, but theback half of the quarter was obviously, much more positive than the first part of the quarter last year.",True,False
434,64388865,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,John Stephenson Glass,"Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just sneak one more. The G&A targets you're giving now is just the pure G&A versus -- that had some D&A in it before. So it'snot an enormous number, but maybe it's $8 million on an annualized basis. So are you looking more favorably on your G&A for the year? Or is thatjust within the wiggle room of the 2.5% to 2.7% of system sales, so it's not really material to call out?",True,False
435,64388865,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Jerry P. Rebel,Jack in the Box Inc.,"Yes, John, it's Jerry. It's within the wiggle room that we provided within the range. If you look at what it was last year, it was just under 20 basispoints of D&A, which was in the G&A category. So the target that we have, the longer-term target that we talked about at ICR is less than 2% ofsystemwide sales, I'd consider that to be cash G&A. So we have excluded the depreciation and amortization, and we also think that, that's a veryconsistent reporting approach within the period, within the industry here. So that's how we're looking at it.",True,False

Are you assuming that the environment changes or gets better as you move throughthe year? And I guess related to that, consumers are starting to see lower taxes on their paychecks, so I was wondering if you are assuming anybenefit from that, or if that would be upside relative to your current plans?",True,False
438,64388865,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Leonard A. Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,"Yes. So current plans do not assume that there's some catalyst that drives performance. We do expect the environment to be just as competitivein the back half of the year as it's been, really, over the last couple of years. And so if you look at what we're planning to do in Q3, for example, thetwo things that we'll be promoting. One, more on the premium side, and one more of a sort of snack or value item. Both will be price pointpromotions, which we don't typically do. We typically have one price point promotion out in the marketplace and another that's sort of unpriced,typically focused on premium. We will, in this case, have competitive pricing on both of the offerings as really some of the additional sort of drivers,or the offerings. So I think our expectation is that it's going to be a competitive market and we really can't afford to take our foot off the gas.",True,False

So -- well as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the our shared service G&A, even thatwhich currently supports Qdoba, is in our continuing operations. Right after we close the deal, we will begin to receive proceeds from Apollo forthe shared services that we're providing for them as part of transition services agreement. It's likely that, that will be shown to offset the G&A theway we would report that, but even if it doesn't, if we try to figure out exactly how that's going to look going forward, we will be very transparentabout showing you what the income level is, or the offsets is to that G&A from the transition services compensation that we're getting from Apollo.So you will see a reduction related to that and at least, the back half of the year or post closing.",True,False

There is no rate, there is no change in the rental rate on the extra rental flow-through would comefrom the increase in the same-store sales that we would get from, resulting from the remodel. The way that we looked at the tenant improvementallowance, I go back to one of the things that Lenny said in his prepared remarks, which is this tiered approach on the overall investment cost,which is based upon sales of higher AUV restaurants, they're going to get a higher investment, they'll get a higher tenant improvement allowance,     then and of course, the opposite would be true for lower performing units. But the way that we looked at this is, we applied the same investmentthreshold for the tenant improvement allowance for us that we did for our own remodel investment cost for the company-operated restaurants.And so, and the hurdle that we were looking at there was a 15% return on that investment, whether or not it's a tenant improvement allowanceor a CapEx for company locations, Chris.",True,False

And a lot of times, we look at what was provided at that May of 2016 Analyst Day, and to the best of myknowledge, that was just was a lot of information about Future CapEx levels.

Any surprises or I would say, lessons learned with how your customers were using, I believe, those calledvalue Jack's way menu, basically the $1 to $5 price point menu? Anything that surprised you?

And notsurprisingly, our taco offering has been quite popular, it also turned out to be quite popular within our $1 to $4 offering. And if there are lessonslearned, it would really be along the lines of what we can do to enhance our sales through featuring tacos. And so, that's sort of one big thing. Asfar as the other offerings, when we have things like breakfast pockets that are sort of new news, they're a sort of innovation for us, but they're alsoshow up in our value price point. We tend to do a little bit better with those products as well. We tend to take existing products and since wediscount them, although we'll get a higher take rate, we also have to be careful about what the impact is to margin, so those aren't necessarily themost preferred method. And when we bundle items with a drink, a side and an entr�e, that historically, had been our best play. So I think whenwe come out of this $1 through $5 price point time frame, some of the things that we've seen are right in concert with what we've sort of alwaysknown.

What's kind of your outlook over the next few years. Obviously, you'll give guidance at some point, but directionally, shouldwe just assume a steady uptick in that growth rate and maybe could provide some context, how many franchise open commitments do you actuallyhave, or for how many units do you have commitments at this point so we know what's already in the bag?",True,False

What I will say is that the vast majority of thegrowth that you see right now is Jack in the Box brand, almost all of it is franchise growth. So the commitments there, and I think that franchiseesare optimistic about the business over the long term, so I don't expect that their commitment will wane. At the same time, they need to know that,they need to see those numbers show up and I think what you can see us boasting on, about testing a new equipment that can drive efficiencies     in our kitchen, as well as focused on driving top line sales through product innovation, those are the things that give them a sense of security, thattheir investments pay off over the long term.

And then, Lenny, just the broader thoughts on the multi-brand portfolio. I mean, many of your peers contemplate whether a single brandor a multi-brand portfolio is the right strategy, going from multi to single.

On the opposite side of that, I guess, what would be the biggest benefit you think you'd gain fromnot running a multi-brand portfolio?",True,False

And so, we grew this thing from 86 units to 700-plus units in that entire time frame, 10-plus years. We never fully got acceptance of thisbusiness model. At the end of the day, you had competing interests, right? On the one hand, you want at the asset like business. And on the otherhand, you have this growth business. And they don't, from an investment community standpoint, work hand-in-hand, they're not clean. So if there'sone lesson learned about it, it would be that this type of model, in a publicly-traded situation, probably doesn't make sense because it's just toocomplex. And so what we lose, I think we lose EBITDA, right? At the end of the day, the -- look, you have a business, was generating some positivecash flow for us, that created some efficiencies on the G&A side and we're going to have to relook at how we, you know, run the model goingforward. But I think, outside of those things, net-net, moving to one brand will turn out to be a very positive thing for our business. We're going to be a much more agile company, with a leaner structure with fewer layers to go through to get things done. And that's sort of whatour roots are, it fuels a lot of our innovation. And I experienced that this week, right? We've already begun to engage franchisees differently. Wehave all these committees that existed for both brands that got managed by brand services leaders, as well as brand leaders, and that all flatteneddown to essentially me and my direct reports working directly with franchisees on the future of the company. It seems easy, it seems like we canmove much faster than we typically do. And we sat around this same table that I'm at today, talking to you, talking to franchisees about the futureand product innovation and also equipment testing. It was amazing how open they were to taking risks that would help us to accelerate ourperformance. So from that standpoint, I think yesterday, when I walked out of 2 full-day sessions with franchisees, several folks are saying, how areyou doing? Are you tired? You seem extremely energized at this point. I mean, I am, because my franchisees are excited, they're engaged, we'removing much faster. It seems that what has taken us weeks or months to make, we made in 2 days.

I understand there's a lot of factors that go into, when you would do that, given franchiseeprofitability, your contributions, the type of remodel.

And then later in the process, I think we'll not only be faster at getting them done, but they'llbe the less intensive ones. And really, what that comes down to is some of the buildings that we will remodel early in the process just require morework and more time. So they're a little more costly, and they have some downtime associated with them. Some of the sites that we will remodellater in the process, we won't have to shut those sites down completely.

Andkind of what the thought is there? And what your initial impression is of what they're doing with the business, as far as sales go?",True,False
483,64388865,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q1 2018 Jack in the Box Inc Earnings Call,Leonard A. Comma,Jack in the Box Inc.,"Yes. So we, so first of all, I'd say, the food truck series really represents 2 things: One, I'd say from an advertising standpoint, Jack's got his swaggerback. I mean, we had gotten, I think, a little too conservative in the way we use Jack in our advertising. Frances really, along with our Chief MarketingOfficer, [Ivana], started pushing for us to get a little more aggressive and back to the old personality for Jack. And I think it played really well, andI think bringing in Martha Stewart played really well. It's more in line with the persona that helped us cut through a lot of advertising noise, eventhough we're a regional player. So I think the first headline is on an advertising side, has worked extremely well, and it's also indicative of what youcan expect to see from us going forward. As far as product development, really happy with the food truck series. It has done well for us, but I thinkwe can do even better, and after spending a couple of days with my franchisees, if we were to evaluate the food truck series today, versus themonths passed before we launched it, we may have actually doubled down on even more protein on those sandwiches than we're currentlyoffering, in order to ramp up the quantity in the sandwich. And we looked at similar sandwiches and even line extensions for food truck series theselast couple of days, where all of us were aligned around really wanting to knock the customer's socks off when they bite into these sandwiches. Sothat might mean price points have to change in the future, in order to achieve that level of quality. But I think, if we're going to have to be aggressiveon the value side, we don't want to lose our brand equities that we've built up on the quantity side, and so it's going to be important that wecontinue to put these wild products out there. I would say on a scale of 1 to 10, food truck series, maybe it's a 7, and I think we can get to a 10 ifwe're willing to commit fully to high-quality items going forward.",True,False

So actually, I appreciate getting that information before the call, so I was able to a look at it. The roughly $6 million that you had isallocated, it's really not allocated. I had a slightly different number, but we're in the ballpark. That was direct Qdoba brand G&A, and that would beconsistent with what the direct Qdoba brand G&A was for the full year, because I think we said, that was $14.2 million. The reason that you can'tannualize that is because the first quarter of last year, Qdoba had a cost in there for an assumed incentive payment at their target levels. And bythe time we got to the end of the year with the Qdoba performance, there was no target level or there really wasn't much of an incentive compensationpayment at all. So you really can't look at the roughly $6 million of direct G&A in Q1 and extrapolate that, so. But the $14.2 million was the rightdirect Qdoba G&A for last year.

502,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, good. And then just if you have questions as we go along, just raise your hand and I'll get to you. So yes, maybe, Andy, just start from anoverall industry perspective. Maybe just as you think about your 3 major geographic regions of North, South America as well as Europe, from anindustry perspective, and there's probably too much focus on this in kind of looking at point estimates. But as you look at your outlook for '18relative to one of your peers that reported on Friday, there's a little bit more of a gap kind of emerging here. I'm just curious in terms of if you weighin, in terms of whether that's you being more conservative, they being more optimistic. Just -- and kind of comment about just what you're seeingacross the markets with respect to that.",True,False
503,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,"Okay, no problem. Yes, I don't think -- do I need to push this button? I don't think we're probably too -- as far apart as everyone thinks. One of thedifferences is that we do have different year-ends, and the fourth quarter was -- and it showed some improvement in both Europe and NorthAmerica, which has factored in their numbers probably a little more than ours. But in general, I think we're seeing some of the same impacts. If youstart in North America, our forecast is that it's going to be relatively flat. But we do see some of the same dynamics they're seeing. So in the largerequipment, we do expect to see some improvement. What we are seeing is a little more impetus towards customers wanting to replace equipment,which we haven't seen over the last few years. I think we started talking about that a little bit mid-year 2017, and certainly, we think that's goingto carry over, over the next few years. As farmers have had their equipment for 4 to 5 years, they have that need to start to replace it, either fromtrying to get back into a warranty period with new equipment, or just to avoid risks around maintenance cost, downtime, those kinds of things.So I do think we're seeing the same type of trends there that should help the market, to some extent. Now that replacement demand, I think, isgoing to help. But certainly, to drive a real significant quick upturn in demand, we need to see stronger farm income, which is driven by commodityprices. So we're still waiting for that to see a more robust recovery in North America. But at least, the trend's moving in the right direction at thispoint. What we also are expecting is maybe some -- a little softening on the small equipment side. The industry has been extremely robust overthe last couple years as the economy -- the general economy has improved, those small tractors have different demand drivers than what we seein row crops so it's more general economic conditions, a little more around dairy, livestock. And so those markets have been pretty strong and we     expect to see maybe some modest pulling back from these kind of record levels that we've seen. So the demand will still be above average andstill be very strong, but that might be some of the differences in what we see versus some of our competitors. As we move to Europe, which is oneof our -- which is our most important market, what we've seen is an improvement in demand over the course of 2018 -- 2017. A lot of that demandincrease was driven by improvements in the profitability of the dairy sector as pricing in that market has improved. And so I think we're still feelingsome of the tailwinds from that recovery into the first part of 2018. But we do expect that to somewhat level off. There's a lot of expectations thatdairy prices might pull back a little during the course of this year, so I'm not sure that there's going to be additional legs to that area. But I do thinkthat demand continues to be relatively good in that sector. When you look at the row crop or cereal farmers in Europe, same kind of situation aswhat we see in North America. The fleet is starting to age a little, so there's starting to be more need to replace equipment. Their typical amortizationperiod for equipment is probably 5 years, so they're starting to get past that in terms of where they are. And if they want to keep that tax deduction,maybe there's some demand drivers there. Opposing that is where we are just in terms of their profitability and where commodity prices are, they'reon -- at the lower end of the levels. And so from that standpoint, we think that, that will somewhat mitigate that demand driver. So we expect tosee a good market in Europe and a steady market in 2018. South America, again, a lot of different drivers there. I think from a -- just a pure profitabilitystandpoint, farmers are in pretty good shape. They should have margins and better soy bean crops this year, based on where pricing and exchangerate levels are today. The FINAME program, which is important in terms of financing, is at relatively high interest rates right now, because the normalBrazilian interest rates have now come down to such an extent that, that FINAME rate is not really that attractive. So that's not really a demanddriver at this point. And we might expect to see some help with that as they renew the FINAME program midyear this year, so we're hoping to seesome improvements in the rates. So there might be some element of farmers looking at that and waiting to see what happens with the FINAMErates. Other than that, there's obviously a political situation. We have an election year, so that drives a little uncertainty in the marketplace as welland maybe mitigates some desires for farmers to invest heavily. So overall, kind of a balanced view. And so we think the market will be kind of flatto slightly up in Brazil this year.",True,False
504,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. Maybe a question you may get once or twice today, just relating to underlying inflation and steel costs. And so maybe justfocus a little bit there in terms of what AGCO has done over the years to mitigate some of your risk through some of the sourcing and globalpurchasing initiatives, and then how that potentially mitigates the impact, and then, ultimately, the industry's ability to get pricing?",True,False
505,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,"Sure. Yes. Obviously, it's one of the areas of cost risk that we have is steel prices. It's an important part of our cost structure of our equipment, andso it's something that we're monitoring very closely. In general, we've been very successful in our purchasing activities. We've moved from kind ofa fragmented regional structure to a more global purchasing organization over the last 5 or 6 years. That's been very successful for us in terms ofbetter leveraging the buy that we have and also moving to a more global supply base, so moving into lower-cost environments so that we cangenerate savings that way. So year-over-year, we're seeing improvement in our material cost structure relative to the pricing that we're getting,so we're generating a net price improvement every year. And we think that we can continue to do that. As it relates, in general, to the steel situation,our -- as you point out, our industry has been pretty good about passing on those inflationary level type costs. And so if we get something that'sunusual this year in terms of costs associated with the steel, I would expect that we'll try to pass that on because we do want to -- in order to meetour targets, we want to have that 60, 70 basis point net pricing that we talked about in our prior conference calls. We -- the advantage that we haveis that we're not a direct buyer of a lot of steel. We're buying components from suppliers that have steel, so there's typically a 3- to 6-month lagperiod between when the steel price moves and when it starts to hit us. And so that gives us a little time to get pricing in and have the visibility inplace to try to have that not affect our margins too much.",True,False
506,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Of the 3 regions, where is that easiest in terms of your ability to respond with pricing?",True,False
507,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,"I would say, probably Europe would be the easiest and then North America would be very similar as well.",True,False
508,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Greg Peterson,AGCO Corporation,"Tim, one of the other areas that we're a little bit different in is where we source our equipment from. We have our manufacturing located, in mostcases, where we sell the equipment. So we're pretty well balanced from a geographic perspective. But in the U.S., I think we're more -- tend to bemore of an importer of finished goods, maybe as much as 15% or so of our total sales in the U.S. come from -- maybe half of that is from Europeand then the other half from Asia and India. So maybe a little more [projected], too, because some of the manufacturing is done outside of the U.S.So that's something else to keep in mind.",True,False
509,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's lower than what it would have been 5 years ago, I guess, given the (inaudible)?",True,False
510,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Greg Peterson,AGCO Corporation,"It is. Yes. So, yes, we do -- even though we do have major factories in Kansas and Minnesota and Illinois, we do still bring in some -- well, components,but also some finished product into the U.S., yes.",True,False
511,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of the direct quantification, I know it's not easy because some of it's raw versus processed. But I think, Andy, you've said in the past, it'slike 1/4 of the raw material buy is steel. Is that still an accurate number?",True,False
512,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,"Yes, I think so. Or maybe another way to look at it is probably a little north of 15% of our cost -- total costs would be steel related.",True,False
513,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got it. Maybe switching gears to just market share across the regions. In '18, as I believe it is in every year, the assumption is that you gainsome market share overall. Are there specific regions or products that maybe you're more optimistic on for '18 in terms of gaining some marketshare?",True,False
514,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,"Well, we always plan for market share growth, and I think we have been pretty successful. Usually, as you point out, that market share is driven bynew product introductions, so something new to the market that we're providing. In '17, we did a pretty good job in terms of market shareimprovement in North America, mainly around the small tractors that we've introduced during '16 and '17. We've really gotten a boost from thenew equipment that were -- we designed, it's a product that comes out of China. It's called our Global Series and it's selling quite well all aroundthe world. And that's helping us not only in the U.S. but in Europe. And we're now introducing some of those new products into South Americastarting last year, and then we'll have another round of them in 2019 in Brazil. So that's certainly an area where we have some good momentum.We also have some new products on the very highest end of the market. We talked a number of times about a new product out of our Fendtmanufacturing group, it's called the X1000, it's a larger traditional frame tractor than our competition sells. It gives the product a little more flexibilityof use. And that has sold very well in Europe as well as in North America under the Challenger brand. And so we're seeing some growth there. And     we're introducing that product now in some of the other markets around the world like Australia, South Africa and even into Brazil. So that productline should continue to help us. It's not big units, but it's a big dollar product. And then we have some new products coming out in 2018 around abrand new tractor in North America that we also sell in Europe. We won an award in Europe on that product, so that's -- should sell very well. Wealso have a new sprayer coming out in North America and we expect to see some growth in that market for AGCO. So it's generally around thepace of new product introduction. And as you can tell by looking at our investments and engineering expense, we have increased that over time.So over the last decade, we might have doubled -- almost tripled our investment in engineering expense. And so that gives us the chance tointroduce product at a more rapid pace, and that gives us an opportunity to grow those market shares a little more freely. So I think it all kind ofties back to our investment strategy. And then, obviously, improvements in distribution as well that's helping us do -- win in the marketplace.",True,False
515,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Just touching on new products. Maybe the combine segment is not one that AGCO has been a big player globally, from a market shareperspective, but obviously, the new IDEAL launch coming this year. What are your expectations? I think you had talked about like a $300 millionnumber in terms of revenue potential. What -- over what time frame and what markets are likely to drive -- where is this going to be more targeted?",True,False
516,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,"Okay. So taking a step back, AGCO's growth strategy, we still are, I guess, more heavily weighted than we'd like to ultimately be in terms of havingour sales be around the tractor business. So we would like to grow globally and leverage our distribution capabilities and our strong dealer networkselling non-tractor products, and that includes combines, hand-forged equipment, sprayers, those types of products. And so a lot of that additionalmoney that we've put in product development has obviously been in refreshing our tractor offering but also in these new other products, thesecomplementary products outside of tractors. And one of the big ones was -- is combines, and we've talked a lot in our December meeting aboutthe new IDEAL combine. We introduced that late in 2017 at the big farm show in Germany called Agritechnica. It was the Machine of the Year, andso it's gotten a lot of good publicity and a lot of good feedback from customers and analysts about the product. It's kind of a clean sheet of paperdesign that will enable us to have better features and have better performance of any combines that we sell today, and we think it'll be verycompetitive versus what our competition has in the market. It also provides us with an opportunity to have a more global platform for the product.Right now, we have 7 or 8 different combine platforms or designs that we're producing and selling around the world, and this will reduce andeliminate probably 5 or 6 of those into 1. So it's going to be a product that we can produce in Europe, U.S. and in Brazil and enable us to have theability to have one design, leverage purchasing better, obviously, leverage design costs and those kinds of things. So the plan for that product isthat we're continuing to do the testing and fine-tuning the design of the product this year. We will produce 70 or 80 combines this year and havean extensive demonstration program and marketing program in our markets, particularly in Europe and North America, this year. But we won't beselling any of the equipment this year, it's more about marketing and fine-tuning of the product. In 2019, we'll start to sell the product. And so aswe talked about, our goal was to get maybe $300 million or so of sales. That would probably be over -- once we start selling it, maybe over a 3-yearperiod, something like that. So we're 3, 4 years away from reaching those goals. So this is something that is -- we're very excited about. We thinkwe have a product that will be successful in the market, and we're trying to make sure that we do this the right way in terms of getting the productright, marketing it in the right way so that we are successful over the long term.",True,False
517,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Interesting. Maybe talk a bit about M&A. You've been fairly active both on the equipment side, as well as GSI. So maybe just update us there interms of, I guess, I'll start with GSI in terms of whether -- are there -- I mean, you've done a lot of kind of build out the portfolio there. Is there moreto go in terms of products that you feel you need to be in on either on the protein or the storage side?",True,False
518,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,"Well, that's a very fragmented industry. So there always are bolt-on opportunities there. I would say that, at this point, we think we're in prettygood shape, so the focus this year would probably be a little more on integration rather than new acquisitions. But we're always very opportunistic     as it relates to acquisitions. And so if something comes up that we think we can add value through being able to leverage it through our distributionnetworks, gives us an advantage in a geography we're not strong in, we'll certainly consider it. But we have, I think, filled out our product lines atGSI quite well, so on the protein production side, we're now -- really have a good product line as it relates to poultry, swine and now, with someof these recent acquisitions, in the egg business as well. So we support producers in all those markets now, and that gives us a good flexibilitybecause those markets do vary from year-to-year in terms of being up or down, so it gives us a little more stability in terms of our profitability. Onthe grain side, we've expanded not only in looking at grain storage, but also the -- all the material handling and conditioning equipment. One ofour acquisitions, it was a few years ago, was in the commercial side of the business. So we can handle big commercial conveyance products now,which gives us some opportunities to grow not only in the U.S. but outside the U.S., like in Brazil, Eastern Europe and those kinds of things. So Ithink we have a good -- we probably have the broadest product line in the industry. We're a more global company than most of our competitors.And a lot of our customers are global customers. And so we think being able to support them in all the markets will be a big selling advantage forus as we bid on project -- new projects for those companies.",True,False
519,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Interesting. And going back to -- you started with North America and that maybe you're a little bit more optimistic on the higher horsepowermarkets. Would you expect to see a similar kind of directional relationship with your storage sales in North America, just given the -- if you actuallydo start to see some spending on the row crop on the equipment side, would that extend it?",True,False
520,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,"I think it will, to some extent. We are seeing some recovery in actual storage area. What's lagging more is on the commercial side. Big projects atport or transport locations or in processing centers for the big producers. And so those, I think, have been held up a little by industry consolidationand some profitability issues by some of the big producers. And so I'd think as those markets recover and some of the consolidation like in the seedindustry and things like that recover or get -- we get through that, then we'll see that demand start to pick up as well.",True,False
521,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And speaking of -- shifting gears to tax reform here in the U.S. Obviously, just given the profitability, where it is in North America, not realizingthe benefit. But have you looked -- or are you further along in terms of potential capital or structural -- capital structure changes in terms of maybeissuing more debt in Europe? Maybe just speak there in terms of what you potentially can do to take more advantage of the lower tax rates here?",True,False
522,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,"Yes. So give everyone a little background, and what we're talking about here is our ability to improve our U.S. profitability. Right now, we're in aloss position in the U.S. because of the weak market, and so we're not benefiting losses in the U.S., so that's driving our tax rate up. And so one ofthe advantages of the new tax reform is our ability to move unremitted profits that we've generated in Europe or outside the U.S. back into theU.S. and so -- on a more ratable basis. And so by doing that, we think we -- one of our strategies will be to delever our U.S. balance sheet, reducethe amount of interest expense we have in the U.S. and then move it into Europe or other markets where we can get a tax deduction for it. And sothat should help our tax rate overall. And so we're in the planning process right now, and we have to look at where we can put that debt intoEurope. And then, obviously, there's structuring issues with what debt we can retire and the timing of it and things like that. So this will be a processthat we'll be working on over the course of this year and probably even into the next few years, depending on when the debt -- when we can retirethe debt and things like that. So it's not a quick fix, but something that's going to be a longer-term opportunity for us and it should help our taxrate modestly over the next few years as a result.",True,False
523,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",Any questions from the audience?,True,False
524,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Unidentified Analyst,NA!,"Just going back to the new product introductions. I guess, you're kind of looking to get away -- or to get to lower exposure to tractor. So I guess,where do you see holes in the current portfolio? Where would you think to grow or to introduce new products, one? And then two, how does theprofitability of these new product introductions compare to more traditional tractor offerings?",True,False
525,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,"I think we're feeling better and better about our product lineup. I think it's the best AGCO's ever had. Through one of our acquisitions we did in2017, we filled a hole that we had in our hay and forage -- European hay and forage offering. It's a baler and a loader wagon that we didn't have,which was not allowing us to feel like we could aggressively ask our dealers to sell our hay and forage line compared to the competitive lines theywere carrying. And so now we have a big full-line strategy that we're unveiling in Europe to where we want to have, in our Massey, in our Fendtbrands, a full line, which is tractors, hay and forage and combines that we offer and have our dealers aggressively selling on our behalf. And so ourdealers are very excited about that opportunity because of the new line up that we have. And so I think through acquisitions and product developmentover the last few years, we feel like we have the best lineup that we've ever had. Obviously, we always want to get better and we'll continue todevelop new features, new capabilities, but there's not something, I think, we'd point out and say, ""Well, we have a big hole that we still need tofill."" In terms of profitability, those products, combines, hay and forage equipment typically are at or above the margin capabilities that we haveon our tractor side if we can get that to the appropriate levels of volume that we need. One of the disadvantages we've had like in the combinebusiness is we've been at a relatively low market share. And that just -- we just don't have the scale in order to get the margins where our competitionhas them right now. So the more we can grow with a better featured product and gain some volume there, that's going to accelerate the marginsin those products. So the other aspect of it is those are typically at least as good or better from a parts standpoint. So there's more maintenance,more parts that you have to continue to replace on those types of pieces of equipment. So that's a benefit to our parts operation and a benefit tothe service revenue for our dealers. So it's a profit opportunity for our dealers, makes our dealers stronger, as well.",True,False
526,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sticking with the parts comment, Andy. It's obviously been a good growth driver for you in Europe. I think there's been some recent, I guess,streamlining in North America amongst the dealers. So can you see -- maybe speak to the opportunity in terms of driving higher parts capture,irrespective of when the combine is launched, just from an overall dealer standpoint in North America as result of it?",True,False
527,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Greg Peterson,AGCO Corporation,"Sure. Absolutely, Tim. So we've spoken a good bit about increasing our investments in engineering and product development. And with that,typically, that means, in a lot of cases, higher-end products, more sophistication, which lends themselves to a dealer involvement with maintenance,which is a very good thing when you look at parts and share of parts business. And so what we've then done is layer on our capabilities for dealers.We've implemented SAP -- a global SAP parts system for our dealers, and what that has done is dramatically increase the response time -- or reducethe response time, I should say, for having parts available for our end customers. And that usually is the #1 concern of a farmer is downtime. So tothe extent we can minimize that and layering also with some of the precision farming capabilities that we have in terms of proactive monitoring,that also is helping as we move towards reducing that downtime. So enabling our dealers to provide higher levels of service is helping us growour parts business. So I think you mentioned that we kind of started this initiative in Europe and, over the last couple of years, have been aggressivelyexpanding our capabilities in the U.S. So we've added different marketing programs on top of that with some preventive maintenance programsofferings. We've done some extended warranties on used equipment. So in essence, what we're doing is improving the capabilities of our dealersso that it's -- so our end customers go to them for their parts, and so it's a good experience, and so that is showing dividends.",True,False
528,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Interesting. You mentioned used inventories in North America. The plan for this year is more work to do. Do you think based on what we can seetoday, do you think -- and based on the retail environment that exists, do you think that issue is largely complete by the end of the year or is there-- would there be maybe more wood to chop there?",True,False
529,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Andrew H. Beck,AGCO Corporation,"Well, I think we'll be in a lot better shape by the end of the year. It's something that we will, I think, continue to look at in terms of -- from anopportunistic standpoint. Having lower dealer inventories is a good thing from the standpoint, the equipment's fresher in the field, you don't haveas much aging or age discount issues, and it just makes you overall more efficient. And so from the standpoint of having our dealers feel comfortablewith their inventory levels, I think we'll be -- hopefully, in pretty good shape by the end of the year based on where the market may be recoveringa little as well as the actions we're taking to continue to reduce the absolute amount of inventory in the field. As we look into the future, I thinkthere'll probably be some areas where we think we can continue to turn the inventory faster in our field -- in our field inventory. And so I think,again, that's more from a productivity, cost reduction standpoint that we'll look at doing that rather than something that our dealers are demanding.",True,False
530,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Timothy Thein,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Maybe the dealers in Brazil. I mean, you've talked about, for a number of years, the need to kind of strengthen and professionalize the dealerbase in Brazil. Just given the historic strong position for Massey in the southern parts of the country and more their production moves into thecenter and northern parts of Brazil, what needs to be done there from here? And I guess, just what's a -- is it a -- do you think you have the productthere to compete when you do have the actual dealers in place?",True,False
531,64389214,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",AGCO Corp at Citi 2018 Global Industrials Conference,Greg Peterson,AGCO Corporation,"Sure. So it's some good questions there. So yes, the market in Brazil is very different. There's the -- and when you get to the different geographicareas. And Central and Southern Brazil is where you have the more established dealer networks. And we're very happy with our distribution inthose areas. It's -- as you move further north into the Mato Grosso region where more of the bigger farms, the newer farms are, is where we'reworking really hard to develop our distribution network there. The good news is that the competition is having to do the same thing. Becausethat's where, over the last 5 to 10 years, you've seen the new land being put into production. So we have historically had a big advantage in Centraland Southern Brazil just because our brands and our distribution network had been in Brazil for decades, so the competition was kind of playingcatch-up in Central and Southern Brazil. In Northern Brazil, it's kind of the new frontier, and that's where all the new development's taking place.So what we've had to do is sign up new dealers for those territories, and in a lot of cases, it -- we'll have a very strong dealer in another part of Brazilthat has indicated interest to expand into that region, and so we've gone in that direction in some instances. In other instances, it might be a cardealer or another successful business person that said, ""Oh, I'd like to sell farm equipment in that region."" So we've had success both with existingdealers and with brand-new folks. And so we're working very hard to cover that area. It's important that they develop brick-and-mortar locationsso that they can sell and service the equipment. And just like in Europe and in North America, we're helping the dealers move up the technologycurve so that they're capable of selling and servicing the equipment. The other thing that's going on for us in Brazil in that part of the country isthat we're starting to look at jointly selling our 2 brands. So in Brazil, we have very strong positions, as you mentioned, with Massey Ferguson, butalso with our Valtra dealers, which have historically been a little stronger on the sugarcane side. So we have an opportunity in the Mato Grossoregion where we're kind of starting almost with a clean sheet of paper to do some joint marketing. So in some cases going forward, we'll see somedealers that are going to sell both brands. So we're working, both with the exclusive dealer model, but then also testing that joint sales model. Soa lot of work is being done there. We're confident -- you mentioned, the other thing is having the right products in place to compete. And one ofthe things that we've focused on in 2017 and will -- and continue to impact us into 2018 is the localization of the bigger tractor technology thatwe're selling in the U.S. and in Europe. And so you saw, especially in the back half of the year, some of the costs in our South America region, someof the costs associated with that in our margins were impacted as result of localizing a lot of that technology. And we'll continue to see that intothe first part of 2018. And then as we roll out those new models, we would expect -- and as we ramp up suppliers in Brazil, that's another key thing,is to be successful and to really sell products in Brazil, you have to make them in Brazil to qualify for the FINAME financing that we talked about.     So we're in the process of qualifying new suppliers. And so with that, there's some additional costs. We don't have yet the volume discounting thatwe will when we get to scale. And the other thing is, in our factories, we're having to train employees on the new models that we're building. Soas we kind of get through this transitionary period, as we get into 2018, number one, we'll see, we think, better performance in the market. Butalso as we move through the transitionary period, you should see our margins improve in Brazil in the back half of the year. So the first half of theyear will continue to be less than desirable margins. And then as we get into the back half, we would expect to see margin improvement. So a lotfor us going on in Brazil this year.",True,False

Commodity prices are on their lower level on -- the grain farmers hada very rough 2016, some are still kind of clawing their way back from that period. So some of them are still not in -- going to be in an aggressivebuying position at this point. But I would say that confidence is improving. Their harvests were better or expect to be better for the '17 harvest.And so all those things are moving in the right direction. And we talked already about dairy, whereas there was a recovery, there is some concernthat the dairy market pricing will start to pull back a little because of higher production levels. And so those are the factors that I think kind of keepus at more of a steady state rather than something that's going to have another step up. But certainly, as you say, the confidence is pretty good,customers are ordering, dealers are in a good position right now.

540,64389962,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,David J. Wagner,Zix Corporation,"Thank you, Geoff. Good afternoon and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We finished 2017 with a strong financial performance, deliveringon our commitment to profitable growth. We grew revenue in 2017 by 9%, adjusted EBITDA by 8% and cash flow from operations by 19% to $18.2million. The successful introduction of ZixProtect and ZixArchive and our cloud-based e-mail protection bundle contributed to these strong results, andwe are pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the market for these solutions. The fourth quarter delivered an acceleration of the trends that we've been seeing with our customers moving to the cloud and often preferring abundled offering. New first-year orders from ZixProtect more than doubled sequentially, while new first year orders from ZixArchive more thanquadrupled over the same period. These new solutions are increasingly being delivered as an e-mail protection bundle, enabling us to attract newcustomers, and to sell deeper into our installed base. Quarter-over-quarter, our attach rates for ZixProtect more than doubled to almost 3%, and new first year orders of ZixProtect and ZixArchiveaccounted for over 20% of our total new first year orders in the quarter. These results demonstrate our ability to successfully execute on our cross-selling initiatives and validate our strategy of transitioning to a broadere-mail security provider from our strength as a leader in encryption. In a market environment that's being driven by the migration of e-mail to thecloud and, at the same time, that is being targeted by hackers as the #1 threat vector, customers are searching for an e-mail protection solutionlike Zix that assures security and compliance in a cloud-based easy-to-use service with outstanding customer support. We are building the Zix brand and our core strengths to become one of the clear choices for a robust and fully-featured email security bundle.We're still in the early stages of executing our bundling strategy, but the results are beginning to speak for themselves. Let me step back for a moment though. 2017 was about more than just launching our bundled solutions to address a significantly larger totaladdressable market. It was also about refining who Zix is and, more importantly, what Zix can be. Leveraging more than 2 decades of marketleadership and expertise in the e-mail encryption space, we've successfully expanded our horizon from just e-mail encryption to become one ofthe preeminent providers for a broader set of e-mail security solutions. Our rebranding at the beginning of the year laid the foundation for our new identify and reaffirmed our commitment to our customers. We createdour customer success team to better serve our customers throughout all stages of their Zix relationship, ensuring that we deliver even more valueto our customers. Embracing this philosophy of driving more value, we then launched ZixProtect and ZixArchive, significantly expanding ourproduct suite. Along the way, we bolstered our leadership team, enhanced our e-mail encryption capabilities with the acquisition of EMS, andmade significant enhancements to our platform, especially our multitenant cloud solution, which grew 87% year-over-year during the quarter. With all of these accomplishments, our accelerating momentum with ZixProtect and ZixArchive served as the cherry on top, helping us to end2017 on a high note. Looking ahead to the new fiscal year, we look forward to extending the 87% year-over-year revenue growth we experienced last year in ourcloud-based encryption product as well as the opportunity to accelerate that success with ZixProtect and ZixArchive. However, the excess churn due to M&A and competitive pressure is slowing our near-term revenue growth and impacting our 2018 guidance. Thisexcess competitive churn we are experiencing is primarily from our on-premise appliance customers, which now represents about 20% of our ACV,down from 27% of our ACV a year ago. We believe the success we're seeing with our cloud-based e-mail security solutions position us well for expanding our market position and buildinga foundation for stronger levels of growth and profitability moving forward. Later on today's call, I'll expand on how we're making real progress tomitigate and overcome some of these pressures.     But first, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Dave Rockvam, to provide more details on the financials for the quarter and the year. Dave?",False,True
541,64389962,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,David E. Rockvam,Zix Corporation,"Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Building on Dave's remarks, Q4 was another strong quarter with regards to our bundling,cross-selling initiatives and moving our customers to the cloud. As ZixProtect and ZixArchive continued to gain traction, we believe we're in solidposition to expand our market share in the broader e-mail data protection space. Turning to our financial numbers in more detail. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 8% to $16.8 million from $15.6 million in the same quarterlast year. Our Q4 revenue came in at the high-end of our revenue guidance range and also represented our highest level of quarterly revenue forthe 15th quarter in a row. The record revenue was primarily driven by the rapid adoption of our cloud-based hosted encryption solution and thesuccess of our new e-mail protection bundled offerings. We did also benefit from a partner-based account becoming current and some compliancerevenue, which together contributed roughly $200,000 in Q4 revenue. Looking at fiscal 2017, revenue increased 9% to a record $65.7 million from $60.1 million in the same period last year. 9% growth from 2017 continuesto demonstrate our solid subscription business performance and customer momentum. Our new first year orders for the quarter decreased 7% to$2.5 million compared to $2.7 million in the same quarter last year. As David alluded to earlier, new first-year order were up 119% sequentially forZixProtect, and up 323% sequentially for ZixArchive. While new first year orders as a whole were down year-over-year, we are pleased to see ourcloud-based hosted solution and our bundled offerings making up a bigger percentage of this metric and the new customer wins. Our adjusted gross profit for the quarter was $13.7 million or 81.4% of total revenue, which is an improvement on a dollar basis from $12.9 millionor 82.7% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016. 81.4% was at the high-end of our adjusted gross margin outlook of 80% to 81%, which weprovided last quarter. Similar to the prior 2 quarters, our adjusted gross margin percentage for Q4 was down year-over-year. This is because weincluded a 100% of Greenview Data's cost while not yet capturing 100% of their revenue, which is expected when purchasing a subscription-basedrevenue company. We continue to expect our adjusted gross margins to remain within this range of 80% to 82% in 2018, as we continue to investto provide best-in-class customer support and operational excellence. For the full year, adjusted gross profit was $53.5 million or 81.5% of total revenue, which was an improvement on a dollar basis from $49.8 millionor 82.8% of total revenue in 2016. Our adjusted R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.7 million or 16.2% of total revenue comparedto $2.4 million or 15.4% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Greenviewdata in our results versus their absence a year ago. The R&D headcount increase accounts for 100% of the overall increase in R&D as a percentageof sales. Later in the call, Dave will dive into the exciting advancements to our platform the team has been delivering. Our adjusted selling and marketing expenses for the quarter were $4.5 million or 26.9% of total revenue compared to $4.7 million or 30.4% of totalrevenue in Q4 of last year. A portion of the decrease in dollars was due to the cost-cutting measures we took in Q4 to better align cost and salesopportunities in 2018. The decrease in selling and marketing as a percentage of sales was primarily, however, due to the increase in revenues forthe year. For the fourth quarter of 2017, our adjusted general and administrative expenses were $2.3 million or 13.6% of total revenue compared to $1.9million or 12.3% of total revenue reported in Q4 of last year. Similar to the prior quarter, the year-over-year increase was primarily due to the additionof a VP of Corporate Development, our investment in new systems to modernize our business processes and the addition of our Ann Arbor office.The systems upgrade project went live on January 5, and we're starting to see immediate benefits from this upgrade. As we've communicatedbefore, these investments are foundational to our plan to grow the company via our build, partner, buy strategy. Due to the 2017 tax reformlegislation which reduces our corporate tax rate as of January 1, 2018, we had to make a one-time adjustment of $12.5 million to our deferred taxasset balance during the fourth quarter. This adjustment was made to reflect the future effect of the lowering the corporate tax income tax ratefrom 35% to 21%. In combination with those adjustment and other deferred tax expense, we recognized a net non-cash charge of $15.2 millionto our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter and $18.5 million for the full year. It's important to note, however, there's no change to our cash     At the end of the fourth quarter, our ACV, or annual contract value, totaled $67.3 million, up 9% from Q4 of last year. From an industry perspective,our revenue breakdown was 50% from health care, 28% from financial services, 7% from government and 15% from other verticals, all excluding2017 acquisitions. Before shifting gears to our financial outlook, I would like to touch on the new accounting standard, revenue from contracts with customers, ASC606, which were adopted at the start of the fiscal year starting January 1, 2018. The guidance on today's call and all future calls will conform to thenew ASC 606 accounting standard. While we are still in the final stages of assessing the impact, our current work would suggest that for the fullyear 2018, the new standard will not have any impact on revenue, as Zix has recognized revenue for a number of years as a subscription, which isin compliance with ASC 606. In terms of operating expenses, we expect ASC 606 to have a favorable impact to sales and marketing expense ofapproximately $1.5 million to $2 million for 2018 as we start to amortize commissions of both new and add-on business over the average lengthof customer life. The result of this change will be lower sales and marketing expenses in current periods by shifting that expense into future periods. And note thatthe new standard has no impact on the calculation and reporting of cash flow. Zix plans to adopt ASC 606 under the modified retrospective standard,and as such, we do plan to publish the details regarding historical impact of this new standard as part of our 10-Q that will be filed in connectionwith our first fiscal quarter of 2018 reporting period. Now for our first quarter and full year 2018 financial guidance. We currently anticipate revenue for the first quarter to range between $16.6 millionand $16.8 million, representing an increase of 4% to 6% compared to Q1 of last year. We are also forecasting fully diluted GAAP earnings per shareto be between $0.04 and $0.05, and fully diluted non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share to be $0.08. For the full year, we expect revenue to rangebetween $67.5 million and $69 million, which represents an increase of 3% to 5% compared to revenue in fiscal 2017. We are also forecasting our fully diluted GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.17 and $0.19, and our fully diluted non-GAAP adjusted earningsper share to be $0.32 for fiscal 2018. With the impact of ASC 606, we are targeting a 2018 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 30% versus 28% in 2016 and 2017. Our full year revenue guidance reflects the excess churn we experienced in 2017, and the roll-forward impact it is having on our 2018 revenue. Aswe have not fully cleared through all the additional churn in our on-premise appliance customers, our 2018 growth rate is somewhat dampened.However, we continue to be optimistic on our growth potential as we migrate and drive growth from new customers in our hosted and bundledofferings. Both of these solutions performed extremely strong in 2017, and have us excited about the future as we continue to execute on ourprofitable growth plan. This completes my financial summary. For a more detailed analysis of our financial results, please reference our Form 10-K, which we plan to fileby March 12th. Dave?",False,True

Beginning with this call, we are changing our reporting framework to focus on 3 main growth driversthat more concisely consolidate the 7 pillars we've been using for the past 7 quarters. The 3 growth areas are one, new customer acquisition; two,sales to existing customers through adding on and cross-selling; and three, reducing churn and increasing retention. I'll now spend the remainder of the call going over our financial performance and progress with respect to each of these 3 growth areas. In terms of new customer acquisition, we're continuing to secure new customers through our direct sales teams, VARs and MSPs and OEM partners.In the first area, we'll also cover international customer acquisition efforts. So new customer acquisitions was previously addressed by pillars 1, 2 and 7. Our primary measure of new customer acquisition is through our newfirst-year orders metric. As Dave mentioned earlier, our new first year orders for the quarter were $2.5 million. Although down 7% from the same     Now with that, we're ready to open the call for your questions.

544,64389962,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,Michael Fawzy Malouf,Craig,"A couple of things. I'm just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the churn, specifically as it relates to the Office 360 (sic) [Office365] and just give us a sense where? I know you had a number of initiatives that were attacking that, and I'm just wondering if you could just drilldown a little bit more on that? And then, second of all, with 8% growth in this quarter, 4% to 6% next, and sort of 3% to 5% for the year, sort ofsuggests continuing decreasing growth, and I'm just kind of wondering, as you look through the churn risk that you see this year, when do youthink that you'll get through that and potentially get some reacceleration in the numbers?",True,False
545,64389962,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,David J. Wagner,Zix Corporation,"Great. Those are great questions. Mike, so first of all, I'll talk about the churn. So we had the health care M&A that we talked about, and the churnin the Office 365 is -- we're seeing it primarily, and as we said, the on-prem appliance offer. And those customers are ones -- some of them areon-premise for good reasons and don't plan to change, some of them haven't been paying as much attention to their e-mail environment asperhaps they should be, and so when this -- the new leader comes in or they look at the cloud, they're taking everything at once, and movingtypically to the Office 365 solution in those instances. So typically, when a customer does that, they'll -- the e-mail manager that we typically dealwith will say, ""that decision was made by my boss. I didn't have any -- even awareness that it was happening."" And that's what we're working toget ahead of, so that -- those customers know that we have an offer. They know that when they move to the cloud with us, it makes the Office 365migration easier when it happens, and so everything we're doing is focused on getting ahead of that trend. Maybe you could see just how quicklywe're able to do that with increase to 89% cloud deployment this year. So we're making -- with 200 migrations, we're making that transition quiterapidly. When you look at the growth rate more specifically, the larger health care accounts that we talked about, even though we're aware of thecancellation, they're moving out at different times, which is what's contributing to that kind of change in the growth rate throughout the year. Andlast, but not least, I think, you asked about, when will this turn? And so what we're really excited about is how quickly we are moving the businessand intercepting this customer migration to the cloud. And we gave you a lots of numbers to evidence how well we're doing that. With 89% of ournew encryption orders being cloud-based, you can see from a new orders perspective, we are largely through that curve. So -- if the cloud migration continues at the pace at which it's going, then we should see this turn sometime in 2019.",True,False
546,64389962,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,Michael Fawzy Malouf,Craig,"Okay, great. And when you take a look at the overall growth of the market -- I know there are some industry analysts out there that have theiropinions, how are you looking at it as far as growth of the whole e-mail and Protect and Archive -- wherever you participate. How fast is thatgrowing?",True,False
547,64389962,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,David J. Wagner,Zix Corporation,"Well, so the -- it's really a transition from on-prem to cloud, and so that, Gartner would have the secured e-mail gateway growth in the low singledigits. Our perception is the encryption part of that is growing in the mid-single digits. And the opportunity that we're taking advantage of is that,that rotation and being positioned to capture more and more of that cloud migration, which is why that 87% growth, we are seeing our cloud     offers clearly way above market. And that's because we're coming off a small number, one; and two, we're moving customers. We have theopportunity to move customers from on-prem to the cloud. That's accelerating that. But that's really the piece that we're excited about, that we'releaning into, and we think there is a lot of room left still in this migration to capture share for these compliance-oriented customers, in particularlyin the mid-market segment.",True,False

550,64389962,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,David J. Wagner,Zix Corporation,"So that's a great question, Michael. So ZixProtect and ZixArchive, we're seeing it where you'd expect it, in health care, with half of our installed base-- there you saw the great numbers, 35% of our orders into the base was ZixProtect and ZixArchive. Actually, our largest transaction in the quarterwas a complete sale full bundle offer, which was brought up the ASP in that account nicely. So that's where the real opportunity is. We're exceedingour plan in new customers. So that attach rate is going a little bit better-than-expected than we expected, but it's the new customer opportunitythat we're really excited about. You know, the trend in the market that we talked about is to a bundle offer, and we're competing very effectivelyin certain segments of the total e-mail protection offer. So that's been really good for us.",True,False
551,64389962,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,Wonchoon Kim,"Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Got it. I think you cited a competitive displacement in a couple of your larger deals -- bundled deals.

Did you put your system behind the competitor'sand catch just more malware? Any context on those displacements?",True,False
552,64389962,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,David J. Wagner,Zix Corporation,"Yes, it's in customers that -- it varied by competitor, obviously. So the customers who really know the Zix brand value service would be a commonthread throughout all of them. Yes, prices really have not been the driver.

Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you need to do there to invest or enable the MSPsto drive that business? Sort of your expectations as we go through the second half of the year and the need to either establish or build upon yourexisting MSP relationships?,True,False
554,64389962,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Zix Corp Earnings Call,David J. Wagner,Zix Corporation,"Yes, so that's a great question. The MSP part is -- one of the areas that we're most excited about is the first place where the full bundle offer is goingto be excel -- accessible easily in a single pane of glass with the very rapid deployment with automated key generation, et cetera. So that will rollout on April 2. We've been talking to partners that have literally hundreds of thousands of mailboxes under management that see, particularly,     adding Protect and Archive to existing encryption is an opportunity. And then, similar to what we've been seeing directly, we're having new MSPpartners that weren't previously considering Zix because we only had best-of-breed, they're now looking at Zix as a very attractive option for thefull suite. So I think we're going to see pickup with our existing MSPs, but probably, actually more quickly with new MSPs that we've not yet donebusiness with.

So first, you kind of touched on it, but are you still mainly targeting theless-than-a-thousand mailbox segment or smaller than that? And do you think that with the success you've been having with resellers and strategygoing forward to focus on the channel even more? Is that going to bring you upmarket a little bit and see some bigger competitors and dealsthere?",True,False

Prior to October, we were not encouraging enterprise salesteam to sell ZixProtect and ZixArchive. With the success we had in our first 4 months, we then opened up back to the enterprise sales team andwe had good success in landing several customers with, I guess, typically less than 20,000 mailboxes -- none were higher than 20,000 mailboxes,but in that greater-than-one mailbox -- 1,000 mailbox space. And where we worked really well is when, again, where customers value ease-of-useand customer support. We're seeing that extending, depending on the kind of customer, up into the tens of thousands of mailboxes. On the resellerside, I see that as being about 3 quarters behind our direct sales team. We focused, obviously, on -- maybe not obviously, but we focused on trainingup our sale -- our direct sales reps first. We've been leaning into training VARs more aggressively since the Fall, and we saw a little bit of contributionin Q4. We would expect that to be increasing. So that's -- those are the areas, the MSPs and the VARs, that we're seeing good opportunity.

563,64389981,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,Donald R. Young,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","Thank you, John. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our Q4 and fiscal year 2017 earnings call. I will start by providing comments aboutthe business and our performance. Next, John will review our Q4 and fiscal year 2017 financial performance and provide 2018 guidance. We willconclude the call with a Q&A session. I plan to cover 5 topics in my prepared remarks. First, I will comment on our patent enforcement wins at the United States Patent and TrademarkOffice, the USPTO, the United States International Trade Commission, the ITC, and in the German court. Second, I will comment on the $5 million prepayment that we will receive from BASF during 2018 and the significant progress we have made inour strategic relationship with them. Third, I will review our actual performance against our 2017 key performance indicators and introduce 3 key performance indicators for 2018. Fourth, I will discuss the current commercial environment, including our market outlook for 2018. And fifth, I will provide an updated view of our strategy, which is centered, in part, on our strong capability to help our customers and partnersshape their own strategies around the global mega trends of resource efficiency and sustainability, help them combine economic success withenvironmental protection and social responsibility. I will also describe the strategic opportunities available to us as we leverage our aerogeltechnology platform across our core, adjacent and new markets. My first topic today is IP enforcement. In April 2016, we initiated a series of legal actions to assert our rights against companies that infringe ourintellectual property. Since that time, we have logged several victories. During the first half of 2017, one defendant challenged the validity of ourpatents at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This challenge was denied by a panel of 3 patent judges at the USPTO, a very favorableoutcome for Aspen. Then, in September 2017, the ITC judge issued an initial determination, finding our patent claims valid and infringed upon by the Chinese companies.The judge recommended a limited exclusion order as the remedy to prevent the importation of infringing aerogel products into United States. In early February, the full ITC Commission issued a final determination confirming the judge's conclusions and issued a limited exclusion orderprohibiting the entry of infringing products into the United States. Also, in January 2018, a German court issued a series of judgments and injunctions against a Dutch distributor, prohibiting the resale of aerogelproducts originating from China. In the settlement, the distributor agreed not to resell infringing aerogel blankets in all European countries wherewe have patents. We believe these wins at the USPTO, the ITC and in the German court, clearly validate the strength of our patent portfolio and demonstrate theunique value of our aerogel technology platform -- brings to our business partners around the world. My second topic today is the $5 million prepayment we will receive from BASF in 2018. BASF is clearly among our most important global businesspartners. In June 2016, we signed agreements with BASF that included commercial, technical and financial elements. The financial support wasinitially linked to our capacity expansion plan in Statesboro, Georgia. Last week, we amended the agreements to receive $5 million in prepayments in 2018, which will be focused principally on 2 initiatives. The firstinitiative is our joint development work with BASF, focused on building insulation. We have made rapid technical progress on an importantnext-generation product, which has world-class thermal properties and is noncombustible and easy to use. We, both BASF and Aspen, are excited     We are making outstanding progress in executing our strategy to leverage our aerogel technology platform across our core, adjacent and newmarkets. Our ability to build base revenue, to position ourselves for significant project work and to continue to exhibit strength in entering newmarkets, gives us confidence that over a 2- to 3-year period we can experience substantial and diverse growth, even within the current energyprice environment. This narrative leads to our fifth and final topic, which is the articulation of our strategy. Our strategy is to leverage our aerogel technology platform.There are 3 key elements. The first element is to grow our core and adjacent markets to fully utilize the East Providence manufacturing facility,including the expanded capacity from the EP20 initiative. At capacity, we would have the potential to be a business generating $180 million ofrevenue and adjusted EBITDA of between $28 million and $35 million. The second element is to organize around innovation and to leverage our core competency of commercializing innovation. We have world-classaerogel product and process technology and the premier aerogel research science is committed to continuing to advance the science. We havecreated a new business development team dedicated to prioritizing the best opportunities for our aerogel technology platform in order to addresssignificant global challenges and to identify world-class partners and optimal business structures to accelerate value creation. The third element of the strategy is to maximize long-term shareholder value. With revenue growth in our core and adjacent markets, combinedwith the improved profit potential in our East Providence plant associated with our EP20 project, we believe we can generate free cash to investin 1 or 2 new business opportunities where our aerogel technology platform has the potential to create breakout value. Our vision for Aspen is tobe a prosperous and valuable leader in our core and adjacent markets and to have the potential for breakout value in new markets. Overall, we are confident that the strength of our technology and the ROI that we bring to our end users across multiple markets will enable solidperformance for our company. Our progress from core to adjacent and to new markets is powerful and creates the opportunity to build a largeand profitable company. We have an experienced team of people, and we are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and to realize ourvision for the company. Now, I'll turn the call over to John for a review of the financial results.",False,True
564,64389981,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,John F. Fairbanks,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","Thanks, Don, and good afternoon. I'd like to start by running through our reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 at asummary level. Fourth quarter total revenue grew 32% to $36.4 million versus $27.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter net loss was $1.7 millionor $0.07 per share compared to $5.7 million or $0.25 per share last year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was positive $2.2 million compared to negative $2.1 million a year ago. We define adjusted EBITDA as net incomeor loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other items that we do not believe are indicativeof our core operating performance. Patent enforcement costs had a less significant impact on our net loss and adjusted EBITDA during the fourth quarter this year than in the fourthquarter of last year. We incurred $600,000 of patent enforcement costs during the fourth quarter versus $1.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, total revenue declined 5% to $111.6 million. Net loss was $19.3 million or $0.83 per share in 2017 versus a net loss of $12 millionor $0.52 per share last year. And adjusted EBITDA for the year was negative $3.3 million compared to positive $3.9 million a year ago. Patent enforcement costs had a significant impact on both our net loss and adjusted EBITDA during both 2017 and 2016. We incurred $3.5 millionof patent enforcement costs during 2017 versus $3.6 million in 2016.     In addition, this financial outlook includes between $1 million and $1.3 million of cost and expenses associated with our patent enforcement actionsfor the year. And for the full year, we expect a gross margin in the high teens and an average selling price of $2.92 per square foot, plus or minus$0.05. During 2018, we'll continue our focus on controlling capital expenditures to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. Our 2018capital budget of $4 million is comprised of $1 million of maintenance-related capital projects and $3 million for our EP20 initiative to expand thecapacity of the East Providence facility by 20% by the end of 2020. Turning to cash at an aggregate level. Within the context of the adjusted EBITDA range in our 2018 full year outlook, we expect to exit 2018 withbetween $8 million and $11 million of net cash on hand. As Don mentioned, we have amended our supply agreement with BASF to secure $5 million in advance payments in 2018 to help support ourcapacity expansion plans, our process improvement initiatives, and our new-business development efforts. This $5 million in advance paymentsis included in our 2018 year-end cash guidance. While we don't provide specific quarterly guidance on a routine basis, we think it's important from time to time to provide our investors with ageneral view to our expectations during the year. In general, we expect our quarterly financial performance in 2018 to mirror the profile of our 2017 quarterly performance with a significant step-downin revenue and profitability in the first quarter and sequential quarterly growth thereafter. We're also striving to deliver year-over-year improvement in financial performance during each of the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month year-to-date periodsduring 2018 and to enter 2019 with strong operating and financial momentum. I'll now turn the call back to Chantel for Q&A.",False,True

566,64389981,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,Eric Andrew Stine,Craig,"Just wondering, could you just help us bridge the fact that you're guiding to flat revenues but also taking these steps to bring on capacity, and Iknow that's by 2020, but flat revenues has got a lot of room now. Just a thought process, is it some of the large project activity that you expect tohit starting in 2019, views of some partnerships on the horizon? Or how should we think about that?",True,False
567,64389981,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,Donald R. Young,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","I think there are maybe 2 ways of doing it. When we're doing an expansion in a plant -- in this particular one, where we're really improving theprocess technology of our existing assets as opposed to adding new assets to the facility, kind of the brute force method, it's very difficult to dothat kind of work while you're operating the plant full out. And so this is the time to do that work. So we've got the perfect time to do it, one. Andof course, we wouldn't do it if we weren't confident that we could grow our revenues to that $150 million level and to the $180 million level. Youjust wouldn't do this. And so that's in the backdrop as well. So our goal here is to continue to grow that base revenue, and we said a few times inour presentation this evening, in that 10% to 15% range year in and year out, and then put some projects on top of it. As you know Eric, we'veworked that progression from doing maintenance work to small-scope work to large-scope project work, pretty successfully. And LNG is the best     -- most recent example of that, and we believe with the successful delivering of 3 projects in 2017, that those will lead to additional projects andlarger projects in the LNG area, for example, in that 2019 and 2020 time frame. So we're doing this with purpose, and we also believe that it's justthe right time to do it, and there's no question that having BASF help shoulder the load a bit here financially is really important to us.",True,False
568,64389981,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,Eric Andrew Stine,Craig,"Right. And that's a good segue to my second question. Just -- I mean, it seems like the health of that relationship with BASF is in very good shapeis this -- is this a case where -- I mean, should we think about that Plant 2 -- I mean, it would seem that this pushes that off quite a bit, or that BASFdoesn't necessarily care whether their $20 million eventually goes to Plant 2 or it's invested in your plant. They just want to have that capacity?",True,False
569,64389981,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,Donald R. Young,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","Yes, they would like access to the -- guaranteed access to the capacity. If you go back to the 2015, early '16 time frame, there were points in timewhere we were capacity constrained significantly -- '14, '15 and the early '16, and they were concerned about having that happen to them again.And so that's part of their motivation here in helping us with our capacity expansion. And it obviously, provides a nice sort of baseload activity forus as well as we go out and create this new capacity. So those are the drivers. The relationship is very strong. We've talked a bit here about thefinancial parts of it, but they've helped us with some of the operating improvements that we're making in our facility in East Providence, and ofcourse, working closely with us through the JDA on these next-generation products as well. So it's a strong relationship but we really appreciatetheir help.",True,False
570,64389981,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,Eric Andrew Stine,Craig,"Right, okay. Maybe last one from me. Just on subsea yesterday, Technip had their call, and they had pretty positive commentary on activity continuingin 2018 and going forward. Is your view of 2018 more a case of -- I know you don't report a backlog, but that the backlog for subsea as it standstoday isn't necessarily there, and it's more about if you were to get awards, you're late cycle, and so that would be more late '18 and -- or 2019 work.Is that the reason? Because I mean, what Technip said and what you're looking for, those are different views.",True,False
571,64389981,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,Donald R. Young,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","So Technip has been our largest customer in the subsea dating back to 2004 and '05, so they've been a great partner of ours through that period.And I was encouraged to hear their report. I listened in and read their work. Subsea is really difficult for us to project. We are bird-dogging morethan a dozen projects today around the world in the subsea. And those could break anytime. So the hard part is predicting it. And we just -- if youjust look at the last 3 years, and John correct me if I'm wrong, if I remember correctly, the subsea numbers were $24 million, $4 million and $14million. So they're just banging all around the place. So it's really difficult to kind of want to hang your hat on any particular number. And so whatwe do is we take a longer-term view of it and just try to find kind of an average number. And if you go out 5 years, the average number is kind ofin that 7, 8, 9 kind of range, and we're sort of just projecting that forward here in 2018. Look, we hope Technip is spot on. I mean, they are reallyright in the middle of that market, obviously, so they know a lot. Yes, we do come a little late cycle, so maybe it would have the biggest impact onus late '18 and into 2019. We feel good about 2019 for a lot of different reasons and that's one of them.",True,False

574,64389981,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,John F. Fairbanks,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","So Chip, the overall project we've earmarked between $15 million and $20 million to achieve the 20%. We'll obviously focus on projects that weget the best bang for the buck initially with that money. So that original -- that initial $3 million will go a long way towards gaining some fairlysignificant capacity during the year. And we'll apprise you of our progress during the year as we go, rather than setting expectations, but we'll letyou know what advances we're making and what we're seeing in terms of capacity improvement. And the $15 million to $20 million is that long-termmessage, principally capital spending. So it would be -- it's in the initial $3 million out of essentially a minimum of $15 million.

And it seems like a nice flexible approach. And maybe if we can touch just a little bit more about some of the markets.It sounds like you've seen pretty broad-based growth across all the different areas, but maybe if you could just give us a little more color on someof those individual markets?",True,False
576,64389981,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,Donald R. Young,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","Well, let me just -- I can just make a couple of comments. We had nice growth in 2017, in both the United States and in -- and across Europe. Goodgrowth numbers, very significant numbers, in fact, in the U.S. and continuing good momentum in that market. And I talked about increasing thesize of our sales force. I'm really -- after a good amount of travel in the second half of 2017, I'm convinced that if we can get in front of business ina timely way, our products are now well accepted. They're well proven. They're no longer exotic or novel products, and if we can get in front ofbusiness -- and when I say in a timely way, I mean, getting the specifications early on of some of these mid- and large-size projects. I think we'll winmore than our fair share of that work. So I'm feeling good about -- through the maturation level of our product or of that adoption cycle, and sothat's been good. I feel good about that. I've talked in the past a bit about the LNG market. Again, we were very successful delivering the 3 projects,and the engineering companies and the asset owners gave us very high marks for doing what we said we would do and for that product to bevaluable to them. And as you look forward, some of those very same engineering companies and end-users, asset owners, have next-stage projectsright on the drawing board. And so we're in a terrific position to compete, not so much for the size that we did in 2017, you'll remember, thosewere $3 million, $5 million and $8 million in size, but for projects that could be measured, you know, in the $10 million, $20 million, even $30 millionkinds of range, so we've done a terrific job doing that. And also, I just want to focus on the adjacent markets in addition to LNG. Our district energybusiness and the launch of our HPS project -- product have continued to be successful. So getting incremental growth from those segments isreally critical to us as we grow base revenue and position ourselves for some good project work.",True,False

578,64389981,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,Sean Kilian Flanagan Hannan,"Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I just want to come back to an earlier question because I'm still not too sure if I fully understand the basis of investment and making that decisiontoday. When I step back and I think about, we've got a core business where, initially last year, you were looking to do $90 million to $100 million.That got pared back. Then we were looking to do $90 million, and then we were beneath that. We're looking, as an aspiration, to hit $100 million,     but you guys expressed some conservatism around that. The other aspects of your business and looking about -- or looking at the project orientation,was a lot of variability there. And so it almost seems like we're really kind of building some flex capacity to accommodate a few LNG projects thatare going to be fairly finite. I may be misinterpreting things, but can you help me to better understand this, because once we expand, if we're therein 2020, I would want to think that we have a good base to our core business that is justifying that, versus the project side. Any help around thatwould be great.",True,False
579,64389981,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,Donald R. Young,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","So our target for base revenue this year is $100 million, and we're going to put all our resources into achieving that number. And I would anticipatethat, that number continues to grow in that 10% to 15% range, year in and year out, as we move forward. And if you start to put a couple of projectson top of that level, over the course of 2018, 2019 and 2020, we are pushing up hard against that 150 number. And second, as I said earlier, theonly time we can really make these investments in the East Providence is not when you're running full out at 100% capacity, but as you lead up tothat, where you have a little bit of flexibility in your management of that facility. And so we are making that -- we have a strong conviction thatwe're going to grow in the way that I just talked about, and that's why we're making those investments now.",True,False
580,64389981,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Aspen Aerogels Inc Earnings Call,John F. Fairbanks,"Aspen Aerogels, Inc.","And one other point, Sean. Some of the advancements that we'll make this year with that $3 million in capital expenditures, will be to improveyields in our plant. And that -- those yield improvements increase our output, but it also drops our costs, and so there'll be a benefit to the bottomline that will accrue later in 2018 into 2019 and '20. So we -- it will help us becomes more profitable. The other piece of it is the EP20 projectsthemselves are principally capital. So it's capital expenditures. Yet this will not require us to increase the operating expense levels in our business,and that's why that incremental profitability associated with the increase -- the potential profitability associated with that increase of $30 millionfrom $150 million to $180 million is so profitable to us. So I think this -- that the investment we're making in 2018 is limited to that $3 million ofCapEx. It's the right time for those projects. When we start to fill the plant, we won't be able to accomplish those projects. We'll get an immediatebenefit from yield improvement, and then we'll get the benefit of improved profitability and cash flow when we do fill the plant. And so from thatperspective, we felt it was the right time to make the investment.",True,False

I follow that, and I suppose that perhaps what it then comes back to me is where the confidence is in the growth factor for thatcore business, because again, last year we ended up in a very different place versus where our expectations were going to be. And again, this yearas you guys are targeting that $100 million, unless I heard you incorrectly, it sounded like you were explicitly stating, we want to be cautious andconservative.

We appreciate being heard. Because a majority of the outstandingcapital stock entitled to vote at the meeting are present or in proxy, I declare a quorum and the meeting has been officially convened. Transactingbusinesses -- here to transact the business that comes before it, I'm going to call this annual meeting of the shareholders to order. So the first item is to introduce our Board of Directors. The first one is always the hardest, a good director, but because of his name, CharlieArentschildt, I got actually a lesson from our corporate securities attorney because he's German, how to say it in German with an accent, but Icouldn't pull it off. So Charlie, could you please stand? We're going to have all the directors stand. Charlie was -- has experience in -- have theexperience in fixed income with Deutsche Bank and has been a great addition to the board. Shelley Broader, CEO of Chico's and was at Michaelsand ran Walmart Canada, brings a lot of retail and operating board experience. Jeff Edwards, Jeff was former CFO of Merrill Lynch, for those whohave heard of that little firm, and has a private equity firm doing business in India. Ben Esty, Chair of our Audit Committee. Ben headed the financedepartment at Harvard Business School when I was a finance professor. He got to get rotated off of that administrative duty, right, and teaches abunch of classes, so thank you. Bo Godbold, Bo didn't need any introduction. He has been here almost as long as Tom. And Tom's successor oncehad told Bo, told him he was going to retire. And for Tom's vocabulary, so the first time he ever had to get a dictionary and look up a word, he didn'tknow what retirement meant. I don't think he still understands the word. Bo, thanks. Our Chairman Emeritus, Tom James. Gordon Johnson, Gordonbrings a great banking experience, is on our bank board and our corporate governance committee. Rod McGeary, who I actually worked with atKPMG, has a technology background and has run technology companies and in board in a number of other companies. I am here. Bob Saltzmanwas not able to attend last minute because of an illness in his family. So we'll remember Bob and his family and our thoughts and prayers today.And Susan Story, from -- CEO of American Water and our lead Director. So thank you all, and welcome.     are they substantial enough to take the risks that you're taking? And they -- are they profitable enough for you to pay attention to? So we're goingto take them through the screen of some 70 kind of products and services on the off-site, and I know our board, we will be very, very challenged.And we're also going to talk about our diversity and inclusion, as we continue to grow and is to make sure this is a safe place for all people to work.And they've asked us to present kind of our diversity and inclusion efforts, where we are, what we need to accomplish? So -- and last but not least,Sunday, we go over succession planning. It's not that everyone is planning to leave, it's that we've done this for years now, and Sunday, and ourboard retreats as we go over every position starting from mine on down and to say who is the successor? Are they ready? Are we training themproperly? Are they going to be ready for the position? Who's going to take their jobs if they move up to the next job? And it's really, really a greatexercise. Because at the end of the day, the success of the firm is by all the great people and leaders. So maybe excluding Tom and I in the top leftthere, we've got a great executive committee. They're very focused, very dedicated, they've driven this business for a long time. Some people likeJeff Trocin, who has been here -- running his business for over 25 years; Dennis Zank, both have been working on their succession plans; Jeff nowco-heading it with Jim Bunn; Dennis really working with Scott and Tash and those changes in developing them. You know really have contributedlong term to the firm. And they want to make sure, not that they're going anywhere now, but they want to make sure that when they do, or whenI leave, or anybody else, the firm's in good hands. So we have a great team of people. Maybe the most -- the nicest accolade we got was actuallyin the Wall Street Journal, you don't expect to get it in the press, and that's Jeff Julien, who was honored as the longest-serving CFO of any Fortune500 or S&P 500 company. And so the title is, finance chiefs are staying longer in the job, and that's good for companies. And that's because this is the profits over just 30-yeartenure. So I'm sorry to say, if you think Jeff can retire, he needs another 30 years just to keep this chart going someday. So Jeff, you're -- we're going to keepyou here for a long time. With that, it's a great firm, built on great values, built on great -- built on a solid financial platform. It's an honor to be here.It's -- I hated to be the first James -- non-James to open up the shareholder meeting, right. Yes, I can change my name. So I get in the world toothen. So thank you all for attending, and I'd like you now to give a warm welcome to Jim Bunn. Jim came with us in the Lane Berry acquisition and hasworked his way through our equity capital markets on the M&A side. He was an outstanding M&A professional, really grew that business, took overand now he's co-head -- co-heading with Jeff. So Jim, come on up and...",False,True
587,64390036,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Raymond James Financial Inc Annual Shareholders Meeting,James E. Bunn,"Raymond James Financial, Inc.","My first name is James, so if that -- that's me. I'll take what I can get. I'll also note that when Paul commented on a record year, he caveated by sayingbarely a record year and I would just want to point out that when they study the record books and say, for example, who's the all-time winning asquarterback in Super Bowl victories, Tom Brady would show up. He's barely the leader with 5 over couple of guys with 4. But he's still the #1. Sothe record books don't always denote barely. And for those wondering if I'd work in a Patriots with Tom Brady reference into the presentation andall, there you go. I'm Jim -- go pass. I'm Jim Bunn. I co-head our Global Equity Capital Markets business or as we often refer it to an internally equitiesin Investment Banking. As Paul mentioned, I joined the firm in 2009 through the acquisition of Lane Berry. It was a Boston-based M&A advisoryfirm. It was a, I think by all measures, a tremendous success. Almost all of the senior folks from that firm who were with me as part of the team whenI joined the firm, are all still here and many have assumed leadership positions and found this to be just an absolute fantastic company to work for,and there's been a lot of growth that I'll talk about over the time period. So it's been a pretty exciting period and I was part of the best thing thatcould have happened to our firm was to be acquired by Raymond James coming up on 9 years ago. It's hard to believe it's been that long time,time flies. I will talk about our Capital Markets businesses and in particular our Equities and Investment Banking business, or ECM business. Thatbusiness has shown very strong growth over the last 5 years on the revenue line and even stronger growth on the earnings side. Revenues haveexceeded $1 billion in each of the last 2 years, fiscal '16 and fiscal '17. Both records, both all-time highs. And earnings have grown faster thanrevenues because our margins have been expanding. The margin in our Capital Markets business has reached 13.9%, almost 14% in fiscal '17. Andthat compares to 9.4% back in '12 and 11% in '13. So together with that revenue growth has been some pretty strong expansion in our margins. If you look at the constituent parts of what makes up our Capital Markets businesses, it's a pretty balanced business overall. ECM represents justover half firm-wide Capital Markets revenues last year. Fixed Income is about 40% and our Tax Credit Funds business is about 7.5%. If you look from'16 to '17, you can see that North American and European ECM revenues grew pretty strongly. That was offset by some declines in our Fixed Income     Within research, sales and trading, the New York hedge fund market and the middle market or smaller investment managers represent core growthopportunities for us. We're focusing our resources to capitalize on those opportunities. MiFID II will represent a significant headwind this year inEurope, and we expect that to affect our U.S. equities business this year and next as well. We're monitoring that pretty closely and we will respond.One of the things we'll be seeking to do in a post-MiFID world, as we refer to it, is to add new types of differentiated research different from thetraditional industry-oriented research. We recently added, as an example, a Public Policy Analyst to our team, and that analyst has already beenhugely impactful at a number of our largest and most important accounts. So I would expect to see us to continue to look for differentiatedopportunities to grow our research practice and expand our research focus along those lines. So with that, I'll be happy to take any questions at the end of the meeting, and I will turn the podium over.",False,True

Of course, you're a Miami grad. Is that an upgrade? I'm not sure. So we have all these football rivalries. I've been on the losing end of allof them but that's all right. So I will now open up for questions from the audience. Please raise your hand if you have a question about any of theitems on the proxy statement. If you have general questions, we'll also be around after the meeting, you can ask us. But if there are any questionsthat you want to bring before, please raise your hand. Last chance. Having no questions, we will close the question period. And I will now ask the inspector of elections to collect any outstanding ballots. I don't thinkanyone has any ballots. Are there any ballots present? Looks like not. So I declare the voting closed. And the polls are closed.

589,64390036,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Raymond James Financial Inc Annual Shareholders Meeting,Thomas Alan James,"Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Paul. I'll turn myself on. I think Paul thought since I turned over this chairmanship a year ago that I might have postpartum depressionif I didn't have the chance to get up in front of the group and talk, which I'm prone to do. So I thought I would deal with some subjects that oughtto be of interest to investors as well as employees of the firm that we don't normally talk about. But I did want to make a comment about Jimbecause Jim is a member of the team of people who have joined us, who are a younger management group from a different generation, andcertainly I am, and maybe even Paul in some cases. But I think you can tell that he has excellent capability which, of course, was honed by hisassociation with Jeff Trocin over these 9 years. But he's a terrific M&A banker himself before he managed this effort, and you can see that he has agood grasp of a business that you may not have thought was nearly as important to our firm as it is. I mean, the fact is all of those core groups thatyou saw listed in Paul's presentation were -- are very important to the firm. They all have different interrelationships with each other. But moreimportantly, they serve new complements of clients for us to serve. And our old words are that our business is you, and your financial well-beingapplies not just to individual clients but applies to corporate clients, it applies to institutional clients. You heard about ECM equity clients here. Ifyou heard from our other half in Fixed Income and Public Finance, you would be equally impressed with their ability to operate in a time framethat has been very difficult for Fixed Income because rates are so low. I mean, it's not a very attractive alternative for a lot of people to own whenthe old dictum was you need to be 60% equity and 40% debt. And there are a lot of us who have found other ways on the equity side to replacedebt because it wasn't very attractive to own. And if the current Fed activity is included, we may well find ourselves back in a position with morebalance in sometime in the not too distant future. Although, clearly, the Fed has not been quick to draw the gun to raise rates. They're being verycareful in terms of their lift. So what I would encourage everybody to do. This are big document, somewhat foreboding, I would tell you. This istypical of most annual reports, except that we have a lot more detail than your average public company does. Many companies today give you a10-K, which, to be frank, is so complex, so many pages that you really have to be an analyst to understand it or a CPA to interpret the financialresults. And so what we try to do is tell you what the company is really doing between this shareholders' report and the part of the document thatprecedes the 10-K. And so I want to make a plea to all of you that when you own companies, if you ever talk to those companies, many of them     just send out the 10-K with a one sheet of shareholder report, which you'll find difficult to finding any facts in of value to your assessment of thecompany. And it's -- one of the most important communication vehicles for a corporation to discuss how well it's doing, what it plans to do tomorrow,you heard both Paul and Jim talk about some of these factors going forward, and that's what makes companies different. So I just want to makesure that you've think a little bit about those kinds of things and read the shareholder report because there's a lot of information in there in thatcouple of pages. And you can see in chart form, as you saw on the presentation, a lot of detail. But in this annual report, for example, you can seereports from all of our major departments that enable you to understand some of these segments for business. And it's key, I think, for those ofyou that invest. And I would tell you, one of the things Jim didn't mention about new issue business being done as levels that have dropped off isone of the key causes is that we in the industry for good reason have tried to increase diversification through offerings of packaged products andthere's less focus today on individual stocks. And I would tell you, I regret the complement of having reduced individual stock business becausethat's one of the things that, I think, makes our free enterprise work better. And the fact is that it's fun. If you're an investor and you spend time onindividual securities, don't have to be serious part of your investment at all, could be a small portion of your investment. But you can have a lot offun doing that individual stock investment. And when you do that, the house odds are in your favor unlike Las Vegas. So you can essentially haveyour fun and end that with more cash in your pocket, which is not the normal rule in Las Vegas. Now you will notice here, I tried to stop this. I lovethis photograph, by the way. I've had this photograph for a long time, needless to say, with my father. And all it does is remind me now of how oldI've grown. It's kind of like looking in the mirror in the morning only and in the adverse side when both my father and I were young and had a lotmore energy, a lot -- but it is important, I think, that you recognize what Paul always focuses on when he gives presentations to our employees,not just our shareholders, is that he focuses on core values. And core values are what has remained constant overall these years and a very importantthing. So when you read these documents, there's a lot more to see than just the comparison between the last year and this year's results. As amatter of fact, I would point you in your reading of this document and that first section on Page 22 and 23, there's a 10 year history, maybe thenext -- yes, there it is, you did it for me. That's very nice. I appreciate that. I have a hard time pushing buttons. I even have a hard time closing buttonsin my shirt. It's getting harder, this stuff. Now this is the short form of what you'll find in the annual report. There aren't as many horizontal numbersthat you can trend over this 10 years. This was not the best choice of first year for comparison in 10 years because if you remember, we had thedecline in '08 and a further decline through the first quarter of '09 and we hadn't recovered by the end of the fiscal year for us in September of '09.And so actually, revenues declined during that picture. And yet for that time frame, we had a calculated growth -- a compound rate of growth,average rate of growth during that period at 7.7%, but 9.3% net revenues. So that it was reasonably good growth for corporate America, I wouldtell you. If you look at that S&P 500, they have a hard time with growth at those kinds of rates, and net income match that during the period butonly because of the ramp-up at the end. And I would tell you if you went back to the beginning, you would see that -- Jeff is that for me, no. The...",False,True

The -- so what I would tell you is that if you want that before this time, which probably only Bo andI remember, Jeff remembers some of that, the fact is that we -- and Dennis certainly remembers, that these numbers were faster growth. And partof that is the natural function of growing a little slower when the organization gets bigger because you have a lot more to deal with and it's hardto create new products, if you will, new services, et cetera, at a rate that affect the base as much as you could when the company was new. Andthat's why we're always trying to find new people like Jim that can put a little fire under the growth rate. But any measure here, if you look at it, thenumbers have grown consistently. We always say we're conservative. We actually have a good growth rate and we have probably one of the highestreturns over this time frame over the last 10 over this time frame since we weren't public that he showed you for stock performance. There's thereason that $2,800 grows to $600,000 which was -- were those numbers that we always show you. And that's just for 200 shares of stock which hasbeen a good thing, I would say, personally. But there are reasons why this corporation has done well. And I want to talk about one other, it's veryimportant to those of you that like to buy stocks and that's quality of earnings because earnings are a thing that everybody thinks when you getnumbers, there's only one way to present, nothing could be further from the truth. Actually, when you think about the quality of numbers you lookat, you see today mostly non-GAAP earnings that are reported, which means that there are adjustments made the way we did last year. But in 2017,the one we had was a one-type event. There are always a few of those every year, so it's hard to say you never have and you just don't have thatbig is what I would tell you on that particular adjustment that Paul mentioned.

Wielansky,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,"Good morning to all our shareholders, analysts and other participants, and welcome to the Brookdale's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 EarningsCall. As you are most likely aware by now, we made several significant announcements this morning, regarding a turnaround of Brookdale. I willdiscuss the details of the strategic review and leadership changes and then turn the call over to Cindy to describe our path forward. As we announcedthis morning, we have formally ended our strategic review, and as we promised in previous earnings calls, I will give you insights into the process.We announced to kick off our strategic review in February 2017. The board and management, assisted by our legal and financial advisers, exploredmultiple options and alternatives to create and enhance shareholder value. Throughout this process, we stated that Brookdale would enter into atransaction only under terms that our board concluded will be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. It was a long and robustprocess. We received interest from numerous potential counterparties. We reviewed a number of proposals, and we had in-depth discussions withmultiple foreign and domestic parties regarding various strategic alternatives, including but not limited to the sale of the company. We wentthrough multiple iterations and negotiations with several of these counterparties. As we noted before, the process was complicated by the need to incorporate certain third-party consents, and we were conducting parallelnegotiations to seek those consents throughout the process. An important outcome of the strategic review process was the HCP transaction thatwe announced in the fourth quarter 2017. This improved the change of control provisions in some of our lease agreements and provides thecompany with more transactional flexibility. At the end of the strategic review, the board ultimately rejected an indication of interest to acquire the company for $9 per share in cash, whichpurported to range up to $11 per share in cash subject to conditions that the board did not believe were likely to be satisfied. The board did notbelieve this offer was acceptable and believes that company can ultimately create more value for shareholders by driving higher performance asa public company under new leadership. The board also believes the rejected offer and our current share price was significantly below the company'sintrinsic value and below our net asset value. Prior to receiving and rejecting the final indication of interest, we had other interest at higher pricesand we've pursued each vigorously. However, for a variety of reasons, including the necessary consents that would have enabled us to transact,none resulted in firm offers. As we disclosed in today's press release, we have now concluded our strategic review. Although the formal processhas concluded, as always, we are committed to evaluating all opportunities to enhance shareholder value and we'll continue to do so. Now let me comment on the leadership changes we announced this morning. Andy Smith will step down as President, CEO and Board member. Iwant to personally thank Andy for his contributions to Brookdale for over a decade. Dan Decker has also fulfilled his commitment to lead Brookdaleas it determined the best path forward. Now that we have set our course, Dan has completed that commitment and has chosen to retire from theboard effective March 1, 2018. Bill Petty has also retired from the board. I worked closely with Dan and Bill, and on behalf of the board, want toexpress our appreciation for their leadership. Let me now announce our -- let me now address our announcement that Cindy Baier will become President, CEO and board member. Many of youknow Cindy as our CFO since joining Brookdale in 2015. She has built a high-performing finance function and led the following initiatives: improvingBrookdale's liquidity, rationalizing our corporate overhead structure, improving the quality and lowering the cost of support services provided toour residents and communities and improving our visibility into the key drivers of business success. When Cindy joined Brookdale, we knew shewas a proven, change-oriented executive who has demonstrated her abilities across multiple industries and leadership roles. Beyond the breadthof her current and prior company's CFO roles, Cindy has had multi-billion-dollar P&L responsibility, has served as an executive officer, reporting tothe Chairman of a Fortune 30 company, was a CEO for a publicly traded retailer and has served for more than a decade as a board member of publicand private companies. The board has full confidence in Cindy. Over the past months, we've tasked her with additional responsibilities, includingto begin formulating a turnaround strategy. She has been working directly with our operational sales, marketing and other leadership teams toplan and begin implementing tactics to improve our results. I look forward to working with Cindy, as the company create shareholder value byimproving our execution, taking additional actions to return to growth and increase margins as the industry rebounds over time.

595,64390109,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,"Thank you, Lee. Let me add my good wishes to Andy, Dan, Bill and Bryan Richardson, who is also leaving the company. On behalf of the leadershipteam and our associates, I want to thank them for their years of service to Brookdale. I'm honored to take on this new role, and I'm excited by theopportunity. Although Brookdale has underperformed, we have a strong foundation and tens of thousands associates who are committed to ourmission and to the residents we serve. I look forward, with the help of the company's associates, to restore the company to our previous successby shifting our focus to winning locally, while leveraging our industry-leading scale. With the changes that I will describe today, we intend to driveattractive, long-term return for our shareholders. In the past few months, by working shoulder to shoulder with the key operational leaders, wehave analyzed our operations to determine what is working and what is not. We developed a concrete plan to focus on the key value drivers ofour business model to improve the performance of the company. We will measure our progress against preestablished metrics. We will be intentionalabout what we're going to focus on. We have a robust road map to achieve Brookdale's long-term growth potential. I'll share the details with youshortly. At the same time, we know that our real estate philosophy is a critical value driver. Our goal is to optimize our portfolio, while opportunisticallycreating value from owned real estate. Let me review our history and highlight the decisions that we've made about real estate. After integrating Emeritus communities in 2015, weundertook a comprehensive review of our portfolio. In 2016, we began our portfolio optimization initiatives. Since then, we have sold or terminatedleases for 165 communities. These have typically been challenged assets in declining markets or community in need of significant resources. Thiswas a step towards simplifying our operations. However, the net financial impact to shareholders was not significant. During the strategic review process, we identified assets we can monetize, including several high-end communities, by taking advantage of themarket where stable assets are in high demand and can command high multiples. This may include some of our highest performing communities,where we don't see the same future growth potential as we see in other parts of our portfolio. We also expect to continue pruning disadvantagedassets from our portfolio. In 2018, we expect to market and sell approximately 30 communities, in addition to the asset dispositions we have announced previously. This islikely to generate proceeds in excess of $250 million, net of associated debt and transaction costs. In the coming quarter, we will assess our capitalallocation strategy for these proceeds. We will continue to look for opportunities to create value from our real estate, while we pursue our turnaroundplan to improve our operating performance and financial results. Let me turn to the operations next. Our operating focus will be based on 3 tenets: first, attract, engage, develop and retain the best associates.Second, our resident and family trust and endorsement by providing valued, high-quality care and personalized service, which in turn leaves us toour third tenet, which is to drive attractive long-term returns for our shareholders. We plan to return to our strong foundation, while we willdifferentiate ourselves based on caring associates who create passionate advocates and generate referrals. It's about winning locally while leveragingour industry-leading scale and experience. On the surface, you may not see this as a big change from what we said in the past, but the reality is, our focus is very different. We will makedecisions closer to our customers by empowering our executive directors with more local decision rights. We are also changing how we allocateour resources. This is about improving our ability to operate by narrowing our focus. You can't be the best of anything when you're trying to doeverything. But we will stop trying to do so much and we will eliminate anything that distracts us from our mission. We will make sure that ourassociates are able to focus only on what matters most, our residents. I'm excited to share a few comments about the 3 pillars of our path forward: associates, residents and shareholders. First, we will invest appropriatelyin our associates. We are on the right track with our initiatives around key leadership. In 2017, we took the first step to invest more in the top rolesin our communities. We made good progress with our efforts to improve the retention of our executive directors and our health and wellnessdirectors. Because of this success, we are expanding this program deeper in our community organization. And it's more than just increasingcompensation. For example, we are improving how we recruit and onboard our new associates into their role. This is already begun to favorablyimpact turnover by reducing churns in the first year. We will ensure that our associates' interests are closely aligned with the work they do. Thatthey know that the work they do is meaningful and that they receive the proper rewards for their efforts. At the same time, we will invest intechnology to remove routine tasks so the associate can center their attention on the work they enjoy most, taking care of our residents. By buildinga workforce that is valued and supported, we can better attract, retain and develop an excellent team.     competitive new openings to remain elevated through 2018 and absorption of new deliveries to create occupancy pressure throughout the year.Additionally, we have seen a difficult start to the year, with impacts from harsh weather and a flu outbreak that began in December. We do expect,based on the strategy described earlier and the investments we're making, that we will begin to demonstrate improvement as we prepare to returnto year-over-year growth in 2019. With my appointment as CEO this week, I will take the time to continue to study the business in a thoughtfulmanner, to meet with our REIT and other key partners and to further refine our near-term plan before issuing formal guidance for 2018. However,I will provide some color about 2018. Year-over-year comparisons will continue to be negatively impacted by the impact of our announceddispositions either due to the full year effect of 2017 closed transactions or those that we close in 2018. However, these real estate initiatives willposition us for creating long-term shareholder value. Slide 21 in our current investor presentation, which is on our website, is helpful to understandthe impacts of our portfolio optimization initiative. This slide is a pro forma of our 2017 result, after reflecting the impact of transactions that arecomplete or in process, but does not include the approximately 30 additional asset sales that we announced today. While some of these transactionswill only be reflected for part of 2018, this slide will help you understand the results of our continuing operation. There is no doubt that 2018 willbe challenging, but with the operational changes and investments we're making coupled with a focus on execution, I am confident we will beginthe process of improving our results and performance and position Brookdale for future growth and success. Our strategy is built on growing thetop line, in spite of the challenges we face in our market. We expect same-store occupancy to be slightly down for the full year. It's important tonote that our portfolio differs from the REIT because we are starting from a lower occupancy base and we have more communities in secondarymarkets, where we project fewer openings in 2018 than primary markets. It's also important to note that because our occupancy declined during2017, we have to recapture the occupancy loss during 2017, before we can grow in 2018. We do expect our occupancy to be impacted by the fluseason. Based on what we know today, this is the worst flu season in 20 years as it relates to seniors. Our first obligation is to protect the seniorswe serve and so as a result, we have closed our communities to new admissions for over 1,000 days in the first 45 days of the quarter. This comparesto closing our communities for 800 days during the entire first quarter of last year. When our communities are closed, we can't conduct tours ormove new residents in, which has an adverse impact on occupancy. At the same time, we are seeing an elevated death rate. We expect same-storetotal labor costs, including benefit, to continue to grow beyond customary inflationary increases. In 2018, we expect a 5.5% to 6% increase on ayear-over-year basis as we invest deeper into the organization to improve retention that creates growth. Finally, we expect to somewhat reduceper-unit spend on capital expenditures, but remain committed to spend appropriately to support the business. So as I wrap up these prepared remarks, let me be clear. 2018 will be a very tough year. The changes I outlined will be painful, but necessary. Andwe will adapt as we learn. We need to fix and invest in operations to get back on the right long-term path. While those investments will impactyear-over-year comparisons, it will ultimately lead to higher occupancy, stronger rate growth and greater, more sustainable adjusted EBITDA andcash flow. Finally, I want to close by saying that I believe strongly in the growth opportunities for Brookdale. In late 2017, we started to demonstrate progressin key areas. Continuing the momentum will allow us to overcome the near-term headwinds and lay the foundation for success. In the future, thedemographics will become a tremendous tailwind for the industry. Health care spending continues to increase as the population ages and seniorhousing will play an important part in caring for this country's seniors.

So actually, on the last question partially, because on the Slide 18, I guess, you talk about the expect -- margin expansionin 2019.

And then, you also said that in also the -- one of the slides, talk about reducing or rather realigning how you spend your CapEx, right? Soyou have this metric here when you kind of talk about, it seems the recurring CapEx or the community level CapEx. So can you maybe flush outyour view in terms of the different buckets for your total CapEx? Also Program Max and EBITDA, enhancing CapEx and any piece of corporate versusrecurring, how can you -- so how should we think about it for next year or maybe the next couple of years in terms of changes versus Q4, forexample?",True,False
609,64390109,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,"So Joanna, we're not giving formal guidance in this call, but what I can say with regard to our community level CapEx, on a same-store basis, it'snot going to be terribly different than 2017. We are expecting to increase our Program Max investments. And as you know, we think Program Maxis something that drives a lot of value for our shareholders. We normally see double-digit returns on those projects and so we want to invest morethere. I will also say that in 2018, we will have hurricane-related Capex as we finished cleaning up the damage in Florida, primarily from the hurricanesthat hit their last year and some extra onetime CapEx potentially to respond to the new legislation that's in process for Florida generators.",True,False
610,64390109,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Joanna Sylvia Gajuk,"BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. So I guess, on that front, so you said it -- you plan to increase the Program Max because that's where you see the highest returns. So whatare the some of the examples of projects that you mentioned that you will try to, I guess, walk away from, so to speak, or refocus this spending. Sois it the cap exposure? Or is it something also that's could on the operating expenses? So any kind of examples you can give us in terms of thingsyou -- as of now, you decided to kind of reduce exposure because what I'm getting at is, is there something where you kind of considering maybereducing your Ancillary Services business at all?",True,False
611,64390109,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,"So let me take that question. I think there are a few questions in there. So first with regard to CapEx, we are not reducing the number of CapExprojects we have by any mean. In fact, with Program Max, we're increasing the number of projects that we have underway, but as you think aboutthe impact of projects on the community, our objective is to reduce well-meaning initiatives that are impacting our communities. So if you thinkabout it, there has been numerous, numerous department-driven pilot projects that consume the time of our community leaders. We have andwill continue to eliminate many of these. Regarding streamlining, one example that we significantly abbreviated was a 600-item questionnairethat previously each community had to complete. We're also improving our decision rights. And so one of the focus areas that we have is we wantour decisions to be as close to the customer as they can be. So we're empowering our executive directors and that's something that's a pretty bigfocus for us. With regard to our Ancillary Services business, we think that's a critical part of our business and we think that it provides a differentiationfor our customers as they're able to get additional care within the same company.",True,False

614,64390109,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Brookdale Senior Living Inc Earnings Call,Lucinda M. Baier,Brookdale Senior Living Inc.,"So we were up in October and November and then we were down in December. Now in December, there are 2 things that were challenges for us:the first was it was an unseasonably harsh weather pattern and the second was that the flu season started much earlier this year than it normallydoes. Normally, we don't see a flu impact until the first quarter, but we did see the flu hit our communities in Q4, particularly in Northeast. Now asI've mentioned, when there is flu in a community, we basically close the community. And we do that to protect our residents. We also do that tomake sure that we're protecting everyone. So when that happened, we can't give tours, we can't move new residents in and so because of thatyou have an impact on occupancy.",True,False

So Q1 is always, almost always lower thansort of Q4 and 2018 is no different than that. As you did mention, we are having a flu impact. It's the worst flu season for seniors as it's been in 20years.

We're delighted to have both the company's CEO, Andreas Fibig; and CFO, Rich O'Leary, here with us today. Thankyou both for joining us at CAGNY again this year.",False,True
632,64390302,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Andreas Fibig,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,"Thank you, Lauren, for the intro and good afternoon to everybody. I would like to encourage you to read first the cautionary statement before weproceed for the presentation. What we want to do today and what we have on the agenda is, we want to show you what kind of progress we have made in terms of executingtowards our Vision 2020. We want to show you as well what are the adaptations we have done last year to make sure that we are really current inthe things we're doing, particularly on the pipeline and on the customer side. I want to show you what our go-forward priorities are. And we willgive you a sneak peek what we have in our pipeline, what kind of products we have to help our customers, and you have seen many of them overthe last 2 days, to be successful in the marketplace. And then certainly, we want to show you the financial performance. Let me start with a slide we have built in 2015. That's when we started to roll out our Vision 2020, our strategy for the next 5 years. We are now wellwithin the planning cycle. The first pillar was and it's still the innovation piece. How can we make sure that we come up with the right amount oftechnology and molecules and products to help our customers to be successful in the marketplace? I want to remind you we spent between 8%and 9% of our sales in R&D to come up with these solutions. And we're really looking for differentiation here. We have defined where are the areasand the regions of the world where we want to win. In particular, North America was on the list, but also Africa and Middle East. We have definedwhat are the core lists, which are relevant for us going forward. And what are the customers we really aim for, whether they are big or midmarketcustomers. And then how can we strengthen our portfolio in a sense of geographic presence, but in a sense of technology as well? And that's whatI would like to show you in the next slide. That's what happened until end of last year already. Our pipeline in terms of innovation and molecules is probably as filled and as rich as it wasnever before in the history of IFF. We came up with 11 new captive fragrance ingredients, all patent protected, 9 new naturals, and with the firstcradle-to-cradle fragrance as well to underline the sustainability efforts we're doing as a company as well. Technologies like modulation and encapsulation are growing double-digit and they are by far not at the end of their life cycle. We are still innovatingin these areas to come up with better solutions for the customers and the consumers. We have made considerable progress in terms of our homemarket, North America. We are meanwhile the #1 flavors house for the mid-tier market. And mid-tier is so important because that's where thegrowth is at the moment, particularly in the food area. We have made also good progress in Africa and Middle East.     remember 40% of all the food in the U.S. is wasted. So they take, let's say, food swipes from tomatoes, pepper. And then they have a dryingtechnology called Infidri, which is a patented technology which takes very softly, very gently the water out of the system, out of the product andmakes powder out of it. It is 100% natural, 100% organic and you can use it for taste solutions and for color solutions at the same time. And this isa super important platform for us for clean label. But mainly for some of our cosmetics as well, and we're talking right now what can we do in termsof lipsticks, even flavors for dental solution or for oral care solutions. So it's important technology, and you will see over the next years more tocome out of this technology. The next is graying hair. It's certainly an important topic for most of us, despite Mike. He was certainly not in the clinical trial. But we have roundabout 8 years -- or took us almost 8 years to come up with a solution here with a molecule, which is a biomimetic peptide which can reverse thegraying of the hair. This molecule is not on the market. Next quarter we will roll it out to all the beauty companies like the L'Oreals of world to lookwhat we can do to put this into action with some of their solutions. So you see very much still in an adjacent area where we were not before. Butnow we are moving into the cosmetic area much stronger because we believe there is good profitability to be get out of this segment. The next thing, again, active cosmetics. Many of the millennials, certainly not me, but the millennials, they do selfies like there's no tomorrow. Andwhat is the statistic? 75,000 selfies in their lifetime. And what is an issue is that it particularly adds to pollution. In many of the cities of the world,you get a little bit of an oily skin. And we have developed out of an Australian lemon myrtle 4 biological targets we can use to effectively reversethat oiliness on the skin. And we will find a solution in some of our customer products as well. And we believe it's spot on, because it's natural, itcomes from one of our natural facilities in Australia. We're the only one who have access to them. And it is towards the target group of the millennials,which is certainly a growing group as well to make a good business proposal here. So you see even in the active cosmetics area, good progress in terms of our pipeline. And you will hear more over next couple of months whetherwe are buying into a technology solution or coming up with our own solutions. Stay tuned, more to come, particularly in the next 6 months. Balanced customer. I talked briefly about it. 50-50, at the moment 50% of our sales was global customers, 50% was local and regional customers.So what are these local customers doing or what do they need different from the big companies? What we see is that many of them like to workwith smaller companies, smaller outlets, because they play a bigger part with them. They like to have customized service levels. They like morespeed in the development of products. And it's very, very clear. If somebody comes like a Chobani and they want to have a new blueberry flavor,just picking an example, they want to have the solution maybe in 2 or 3 weeks to launch this product quite quickly, which is very different fromother bigger companies where it takes more time. So we said what can we do at IFF to build an outlet, which exactly can serve the midmarket? And we created a platform. It's called Tastepoint herein the U.S. And I can tell you what we have seen so far is double-digit growth out of Tastepoint. So we took 2 of our acquisitions, Ottens and DavidMichael, both in Philly. We united them under the label of Tastepoint and rolled it out since last year and it is growing quite dramatically comparedto the core business. And I'll show you a quick video of what we did here. (presentation)",False,True
633,64390302,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Andreas Fibig,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,"And so far, we see good success, double-digit growth in the U.S. market towards these customers. Now the challenge for the team is how can weroll it out on a global base? What can we do to do it in Europe and some of our other bigger markets as well? But we are not stopping in the U.S.We inaugurated a new creative center in Cairo, particularly for the North African customers. We're investing in Sri City, which is north of Chennai,into a new flavors and fragrance facility for our local customers in India, which is a super important market to us, double-digit growth as well. Andwe're building a new factory in China as well. You see there is more to come, in particular, towards the small and midsized customers. So how do we maximize the portfolio to harvest the profitability we need going forward? These are the 4 categories, particularly the first 3 wherewe put some emphasis on it because they're incredibly profitable for us and for our customers as well. I always touched on the active cosmetic     ingredients, particularly in hair care and skin solutions, Fine Fragrances, Beverages, and then the value-added seasoning. And I think the mostimportant thing is the value added here because that what makes the difference compared to regular seasoning solutions. On generating return. We generated $125 million in total savings over the last 4 years -- over the last 3 years and that's '18, the estimate. We usedit to help to both for the bottom line but as well to look where can we invest it, particularly in the R&D field to make sure that we have enough drypowder in our pipeline. We did a couple of exercises with 0-based projecting, acquisition of integration synergies, procurement, the usual things.It's a lot of homework, but it's yielding results in the last 3 years and certainly going forward here as well. So and that's already the summary of the first part of the presentation you see. We had our strategy in 2015. We executed on the strategy. Weadapted last year because of the volatility of the market. And you see the 4 new elements in there like drive differentiation, balance customers,maximize portfolio and generate return, they are all in the confines of our -- hovers on the confines of our 4 pillars. And I hope that gives you an idea what we have done in the execution of these and what kind of results that has yielded so far. But I know that Rich will talk about more results to come going forward. Rich?",False,True
634,64390302,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Richard A. O'Leary,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,"Thanks, Andreas, and good afternoon to everybody. It's a pleasure to be here again. Somehow I missed the demo day for Greyverse in New York.So I'm going to have to get that the next time it comes around. It's my objective today, walk you through a quick recap on our 2017 results that weannounced last week, but the bulk of my discussion will be forward looking around 2018 and how we think about our financial perspectives andthe capital allocation on a long-term basis. Under the recap, our 2017 results, again, on the right side, you see full year results on currency neutral basis, top line growth at 9%, includingacquisitions. Currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 5% during the year. And currency neutral EPS grew 9%. We did have the benefit inthe fourth quarter related to a substantially lower tax rate related to some valuation allowances that we eliminated in the fourth quarter. As I stepback and think about 2017, it was a solid year. I mean, we continue to make progress against our performance after 2 difficult years in 2015, 2016.I think we certainly exited 2017 with more momentum than what we saw entering 2017, the first half of the year. And I think that sets a goodfoundation for our plan in 2018 and going forward. From a cash standpoint and cash generation, I'll talk about cash flows in a couple of slides, but overall when you think about our capital allocationand what we used cash for in 2017, from a CapEx standpoint, which is our first priority, what are we going to do to grow the organic business. Wespent about 4% of sales on CapEx in 2017. Andreas highlighted some of the key projects as we continue to make investments, particularly in GreaterAsia and our creative centers around the world. From an M&A standpoint, as we talked about, we've spent a little over $200 million on the acquisitions of Fragrance Resources and PowderPure.Andreas certainly walked you through the strategic logic behind both of those acquisitions. And those 2 businesses on a run-rate basis are expectedto add about $90 million in revenue to our top line. And the third key pillar of our capital allocation strategy, returning cash to our shareholders. A little over $260 million in cash returned to theshareholders in 2017 right within our long-term targets of 50% to 60% at 56% of sales. And we continue to make that a priority. And our cash flowsenable us to do that and balance the internal aspects of the business as well as our shareholders, stakeholders and their interest in our business. So enough of the past looking backwards, let me just focus now going forward. This is a recap of our financial expectations and our projections for2018. On an adjusted currency neutral basis, we expect to have a top line growth of 3% to 5% in 2018, improve leverage in the business betweentop line and operating profit with operating profit on a currency neutral basis adjusted growing 5% to 7%. And a little bit of pressure betweenoperating profit and EPS, with EPS growing on a currency neutral basis 4% to 6%. The bit of the drag between operating profit and EPS, the effectivetax rate is expected to go up a little bit in 2018. We've got higher interest expense and lower pension income that are driving the deleveragebetween operating profit and EPS. But still good strong improved performance and sequential improvement from what we've seen from '15 to '16     From a cash returned to shareholders standpoint, you see here our components of cash returned to shareholders since 2013 to 2017, over that5-year period, we've returned in excess of $1 billion to shareholders. The components and mix has changed over time. 2015, 2016, we were wellabove this 50% to 60% target. 2017, as I alluded to earlier, was about 56% split between, primarily dividend and share buybacks had come downsignificantly from prior year periods. For 2018, I would expect this to be in a similar range and somewhere between 50% and 60% with the primarydriver being dividends as opposed to share repurchases. With that, let me turn it back over to Andreas.",False,True
635,64390302,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Andreas Fibig,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,"Thank you, Rich. Let me summarize what we have presented here so far. So what really makes us optimistic going forward towards '18 and thenthe last 2 years of our strategic planning cycle is we believe we have the right strategy in place. We're executing the strategy. We've demonstratedrobust progress in most of the elements and the pillars of the strategy. We've very focused priorities whether is it in the R&D piece or in the pipelineto come up with right solution for our customers, or whether it is the outreach to the new customer groups or more dynamic customer groups tomake sure that we really capture that growth as well. And as you have seen from Rich's presentation, we have made progress on the financial sideas well. So that's what we wanted to present to you, our vision, our execution and how we see 2018 and probably, a little bit of a peek of '19 as well becausesome of it will basically reach into '19 as well. So thank you very much, and we are open for questions. Mike?",False,True

The second one is thequality and how fast and quickly a molecule is already used by the perfumers. So I can't answer that question. But it will help us to propel the $300million to $400 million Fine Fragrance business in a good growth rate going forward and all encumbered without going to every single moleculebecause it really depends how frequently it's used by the perfumers. But I can tell you we had in the past roundabout 1 to 2 new molecules andnow we're having a much higher rate. And we've adapted our ingredient strategy as well because we are selling some of our ingredients to othercompanies as well, even our competitors. And in the past, we've kept the captured molecules for a longer period just to ourselves. Now we havejust 6 to 12 months where we have them and then we sell them to the outside world as well, which helps us with our Ingredients sales and putsmore pressure on the internal organization as well to use them as long as they are really proprietary to them.",True,False

EBIT is bit of an extra situation because of the tax reform, but that will basically pan out over the next 1 or 2 years as well,which means basically in sales and operating profit, we are back to our long-term targets.",True,False

And it's a constant conversation we are having across the executive committee as we getupdated views and evaluate the trade-offs. I think what's going to long term drive it is continue -- more sustainable growth on an ongoing basis.We'll continue to invest in innovation that will enable us to maintain a strong and improving sales mix. We continue to focus on productivity everyyear. But it's not -- I'm not going to sit here and tell you we're going to have another -- the kind of improvement we had over the last 6 or 7 years.That's where we have to manage it.

So while we have a good pipeline in place as well to get andcreate some extra goals, particularly out of this area. Maybe there is one thing as we get frequently the question, are the smaller customers lessprofitable than the bigger customers? It's not the case.

What we did in terms of R&D, we have streamlined our R&D platforms. So we have now less platforms than we hadbefore, to really put the funds and the resources behind the most important projects. And I spent my life in research intense industries. It's aboutthe process and where you really put the money behind. And secondly, we have more invested into outside R&D like PowderPure. We bought thiscompany for, what is it, $55 million. And that's -- it's actually considered an R&D investment as well because we basically bought the technology.So if you would put these things we have done on the M&A side into the R&D budget, you actually would see a growth, but it's not reported likethat.",True,False

Just is there anything different in the environment that you see today versus 12 months ago, kind of the sustainability of the recent trendsand outlook, as you think, into later this year and '19?",True,False
646,64390302,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Andreas Fibig,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,"Let me start -- that's very important. Let me start with the big picture. Actually I went to a Goldman event, and we talked about GDP growth in allthe regions. And I think that Rich mentioned it. It's probably since 2006, the first time that we see all regions have good and solid growth in termsof GDP, which is seriously very helpful for us as well. So that's a positive momentum. The second positive momentum finally after so many yearswith currency drag, we have some tailwind here as well. And what we have seen in the fourth quarter already is the pickup in volume. And I canbe very blunt and very honest to you. We saw it at the beginning. Is it just an inventory rebuild for many of our customers. But I said it on theearnings call last week is what we see is it continues into the first quarter. So an elaborated guess is that we see some volume growth, in particularin some of the emerging markets like Brazil, it's coming back for us in the fragrance business and it's a super important market. So volume growthis happening. But what we see more is even more bifurcation of our customer growth. We have still customers, which have really a hard time togrow their business, maybe because of the categories, maybe because how they approach the market, but others are actually very, very, verysuccessful going forward. Let me take 2 of these companies, L'Oreal and Est�e Lauder, for example, it's just going very well and they are big customerof ours. So I think for us it's super important to figure out what are the right customers that we want to put our efforts behind and help them withall the solution going forward. So again, a lot of macro factors are now in our favor. And we see a volume pickup. But it's not unisonal, it dependsalso on the customer. I hope that helps.",True,False

648,64390302,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Mark S. Astrachan,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Wanted to ask just firstly, how do you think about developing market growth? We have heard some companies talk about expectations forimprovement. I guess, how do you see it from where you stand? What might be a reasonable rate of growth as you sort of look out at that pieceof your business, which is obviously a pretty big chunk of what you do over the next year or 2 or 3? And then switching gears a bit, I wanted to askyou about consolidation within the space. Not specific to you all engaging in it, very broadly, how would you think about value-add and doingsomething like that where there would be, from a customer standpoint, opportunities to cross-sell products, create sweets, for example, of thingsbeyond just flavors and fragrances, and maybe, broadly as well how do you think about consolidation within the F&F Group inclusive of whetherthe customers who are all talking over the last few days and tomorrow about cost savings, productivity, how does that work in terms of trying tokeep a consolidated group of suppliers honest or do they invite more folks to start bidding on their business and, therefore, reducing the need orwant of consolidating?",True,False
649,64390302,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Andreas Fibig,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,"Okay. That's a lot of questions, Mark. Let me try to answer them all. Let's start with the emerging market. We see a revival. You see it and I talkedabout Brazil. But we see it in Asia as well. India, very, very strong for us. That's one of the reasons why we're investing in U.S., sits on the groundthere. It's coming back. Interesting enough, even regions like the Middle East and Africa. Anyway that's good growth. So that's good because that'ssupplementing our growth rate, in particular because we have 50% of our sales in emerging markets already. So that's really, really helpful. Andthat was not helping in the last 2 years. On the consolidation front, in this space you have probably the 4 big players and then a couple of medium-sizeplayers or small players. What we have done is with Ottens, David Michael, for example, Fragrance Resources, we did a rollup strategy of some ofthe smaller assets to get geographic size or, let's say, focus on smaller customers. So that will probably continue. The big move, we discussed it's     in this industry for years, it depends on about the willingness of the partners to do it. But you mentioned something which is really important. Ibelieve that it is very wise not to look into your super narrow home turf of the F&F business, but to look a little outside as well, as we did with theactive cosmetics, are there areas which are really helping, could help us to grow our market and to grow, let's say, the whole piece of the area wherewe're playing in? And that's something as long as it creates synergies in terms of R&D or in terms of our customer base, because usually they arethe same customers for active cosmetics, it makes a lot of sense. So we're looking at adjacent areas and if the opportunity presents, we are certainlywilling to go forward. On the cost savings side, we see certainly that, in particular, many of the bigger customers are very in the cost savings modestill. I actually believe it is dangerous if you look at the top line they want to produce. And you could say, it's actually good for us because then weare the company which has to deliver the innovation, which hopefully makes the products -- product grow. But it's not always the case. But wedon't see it in many of the midsize customers, which are quite investing in what they are doing. So I would say, again, here, it's a very mixed pictureand we have to figure out with whom are we playing and how we're playing. And another recipe against, let's say, cost pressure on our side iscertainly innovation, which can't be substituted. And as more innovative you are, better is your pricing position as well. And believe me, we certainlydo a lot in terms of putting a lot of pressures on our suppliers as well to make sure that if we get, let's say, some leverage on that side as well. Yes,Lauren.",True,False
650,64390302,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Lauren Rae Lieberman,"Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division","I was just curious, as you're dealing with [the world mood] with clean labels, naturals so and so forth, are customers willing to pay up for that? Oris it becoming an expectation that just they need a broader range of options and you need to provide it at the same cost structure?",True,False
651,64390302,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",International Flavors & Fragrances Inc at Consumer Analyst Group ofNew York Conference,Andreas Fibig,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,"It's a typical answer. It depends. So if you have some of these very premium brands or premium customers, which you see in the Est�e Lauders ofthe world and some of their sub-brands, they are very much willing to pay for this extra because they know that they get a new ingredient, whichis 100% natural and specifically, harvest and they can make also a marketing story out of it. I can tell you that there will be a perfume of FineFragrance, which will be launched end of this year, early next year where we have a plant of rose in India where it makes a huge difference whereyou harvest it in the morning or in the evening. We are harvesting it in the evening because it has much more of an animalic smell because it attractsall the insects for the pollination. So we have customers who want exactly that and they pay a lot of money for it. And we have to figure out whoare these customers? What are these products? And how can we sell this in a best way? Is it going mass market? Probably not. And I give you anexample where it is fitting out right now. Everybody wants to have natural vanilla. But all of you who know a little bit about ingredients, naturalvanilla out of Madagascar was USD 20 per kilogram 3 years, 2.5 years ago. It was $550 last quarter. So it's very clear that many of them can't affordthat. Big staple products can't afford it, and they need more synthetic solution. So sometimes the wish is there, they want to do it. But they can'tafford it. So for us is to figure out who really can afford which product category and what can we offer, whether it's the India plant captured in theevening or do we need something we have to provide to our customers, which is a synthetic solution, which I'm not against because profitabilityof synthetic solution is pretty good as well. So that -- and you know we have 35,000 SKUs. Maybe for all the people who are not so familiar withour industry, almost all of our products are tailor-made for these folk.

I would say that's in probablyin the receivables area where we had an increase in overdues -- not at risk of nonpayment. I think on the payables side, it's continuing to stay closeto what's going on in market trends and market benchmarks in terms of our payment terms. We've got to get to a point where we have balancebetween what our customers are paying us and what -- and what we are paying our vendors in terms of days payables or days sales outstanding.     The challenging area we're going to have, particularly as I think about '18, is around inventories with some of the things that Andreas talked about,whether it's vanilla prices or whether it's us dealing with the citral situation where our primary focus right now to make sure that we don't interruptsupply to our compound customers. And if that means we're going to have to bring inventories up in the first half of the year, we're going to dothat. So I think it's going to be -- the improvements will probably be back-ended.

If youback out acquisitions amongst that group, it seems like the rate of growth has slowed.

664,64388363,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Life Storage Inc Earnings Call,David L. Rogers,"Life Storage, Inc.","Thank you, Diane, and welcome to our call.     Last night, we recorded adjusted FFO of $1.34 share for the fourth quarter against a pretty tough year-over-year comparison. During the quarter,we acquired a state-of-the-art CMO property in downtown Charlotte, sold a non-core store at Salt Lake and another in Austin, continued theramp-up of our third-party management platform and refinanced $450 million of short-term debt beyond a 10-year note with a sub-4% interestrate. We ended the quarter with 91% occupancy in our same-store pool and had over 90% for the total pool, both record year-end levels for LSI.This puts us in good position starting 2018 after a year in which we fully completed the integration of 120 stores we acquired in 2016 and fullycompleted the transition to the Life Storage brand. In the self-storage sector, consumer demand remains strong, and we see healthy demand across our markets, giving us increased confidence inour prospects for growth in 2018. As we've said, demand for storage space typically outpaces population growth by a bit, and we continue to seethat with increased household formation. We also have been pretty successful in augmenting our residential customer base with more penetrationinto the business sector, stimulating demand via our B2B programs. New supplies have been the headwind to our sector the past 3 quarters andwill continue to be so probably into 2019. While it's created pressure on rate growth, we believe the impact remains manageable as evidenced byour ability to maintain strong occupancies. Supply levels vary greatly across markets, and as noted on previous calls, we faced our biggest challenges in the big 4 Texas markets: HoustonDallas, Austin and San Antonio. In total, the properties in these markets comprise 23% of our same-store pool. To give some context to our exposure,we have 116 wholly owned properties in Texas. And in the past 24 months, 77 stores have opened in these areas. We foresee up to 39 more in thenext 18 months. So these are expected to have a somewhat adverse effect in as many as 93 of our Texas properties going into 2019. But as we'veconsistently said, these are rapidly growing vibrant markets that are ideal for self-storage. It's the cyclical drag that's causing us some pain now,but mid to long term, we love this big Texas City and expect to benefit from our strong presence there. Other markets, which have some oversupplyconcerns, include Chicago, Denver, parts of Phoenix and Miami. The impact to Life Storage resulting from new builds in these cities is not as strongas it is in Texas, but there will be pricing pressure due primarily to the short-term disruption caused by move-in incentives. We're bullish at mostof Florida, St. Louis and much of the Northeast. While we're seeing some new supply in these markets, it's not always near us, and for the most part,the construction has been warranted. The markets we've moved into last year, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Northern California, are likewise performingwell. With the exception of property taxes and Internet spend, operating expenses remain pretty well controlled, and we expect that to continuefor the coming quarters. But from all we can predict, property tax increases are going to remain a significant factor resulting in NOI growth. Looking at the transaction market, we've seen little movement in bid/ask prices over the past few quarters. Few data points exist, although a fewmidsize reduced quality portfolios are on the market. There's continued strong interest from the private sector for storage properties of alldenominations. We're aware of the challenges to our sector with some markets needing time to absorb the recently built facilities and others justabout to see the start of some new constructions. But demand is there and the tools are in our kit for Life Storage to perform well even in thiscompetitive part of the cycle. These include proven marketing revenue management and customer service platforms, a well-developed B2B division,opportunities across our portfolio expand and enhance our properties, a rock-solid balance sheet and strong operating cash flow. We entered 2018confident that our largest scale, improved financial strength, stronger brand and greater presence will enable us to grow the value of our company. And Andy, with that, I'll turn it to you.",False,True
665,64388363,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Life Storage Inc Earnings Call,Andrew J. Gregoire,"Life Storage, Inc.","Thanks, Dave. As Dave mentioned, last night, we reported quarterly adjusted funds from operations of $1.34 per share compared to adjusted FFO of $1.31 pershare for the same period in 2016. These results were above the high end of our forecast, driven by better-than-expected same-store performance,as well as CofO and lease-up store growth that exceeded our estimates. We have excluded from adjusted FFO the cost of interest rate swapterminations and other charges associated with our debt refinancing that occurred in conjunction with our issuance of 10-year bond. Also excludedfrom FFO was the cost related to Paul Powell's retirement, a valued member of our team, who retired after 20 years with Life Storage. Same-store quarterly revenue grew 1.3% as a result of occupancy gains. Same-store occupancy at December 31 was a fourth quarter record highfor our company of 91%, a 60 basis point increase over 2016 year-end occupancy. Fourth quarter same-store expenses outside of property taxes     were well controlled by our teams, increasing only 1%. As noted on our previous call, we gained significant online traction with the Life Storagebrand early in the fourth quarter, which enabled us to reduce our Internet marketing spend to more normalized levels. As expected, property taxesincreased 8% in the fourth quarter with significant increases in Austin, Texas, Chicago, St. Louis and certain Florida markets. In addition to the improved performance of our same-store portfolio, we continue to see consistent growth trends at the properties that wepurchased at Certificate of Occupancy are very early in the lease-up stage. Even though we are in the traditionally slower season, average occupancyfor these lease-up stores increased by 260 basis points on a sequential quarter basis from 74.8% at September 30 to 77.4% at December 31. For Life Storage acquisitions, stores continue to grow occupancy with average quarterly occupancy at the 70 stable stores growing to 90.6% fromthe prior year's 86.3%. The 11 non-stabilized Life Storage stores experienced occupancy gains ahead of expectations and had an average occupancyof 86.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017, leaving additional room for growth in both pools. The overall fourth quarter revenue increase also reflecteda 49% increase in management fee income to $2.4 million as the strength of the Life Storage brand is resonating with independent owners. Fourth quarter G&A costs were flat year-over-year even with the added $941,000 of officer retirement cost reported. We further strengthened ourbalance sheet during the quarter by opportunistically refinancing $225 million of short-term bank debt and a portion of our line of credit. The new10-year $450 million public bond carry some very attractive 3.875% rate. This transaction also significantly extended our debt maturity schedule.Our weighted average debt maturity is now 7.8 years. At the end of the quarter, we had $9 million of cash on hand and $395 million available onour line of credit. We have no debt maturities until December of 2019. Our debt service charge ratio was a healthy 4.9x and our net debt to recurringEBITDA ratio was 5.6x. We acquired one newly constructed store during quarter in Charlotte, North Carolina for $12.5 million. We have no remainingCertificate of Occupancy stores under contract. With regard to guidance, although we have achieved positive revenue trends in many of our top markets, we continue to see softness in othermarkets due to new supply. From the expense side, we see pressure on payroll and benefit costs, property taxes and insurance. Nonetheless, weexpect a decrease in Internet marketing spend to keep overall expense growth in check. We have forecasted revenue growth for Q1 to be in the1.25% to 2.25% range. And for the year, revenue growth is expected at 1% to 2%. Expenses outside of property taxes are expected to increase between 1% and 2% for the quarter and the year, while property taxes are forecastedto increase 5.5% to 6.5%. Once again, we are not including in our same-store group any stores acquired as CofO that have not reached stabilizedoccupancy above 80% at market rates as of January 2017. Our guidance assumes no acquisitions for our own portfolio nor does it reflect anypotential dispositions. As a result of the above assumptions, we are forecasting adjusted funds from operation for the full year 2018 to be between$5.33 and $5.43 per share and between $1.24 and $1.28 per share for the first quarter of 2018.

Q1, you won't see the big benefit because we didn'thave the heavy spend. 2 and 3, you'll see the biggest benefit, probably a -- it could be anywhere between a 10% and 20% reduction in those quartersinterim to that spend.

Our strong results and industry-leading internal growth are a directreflection of our team's intensive focus on execution as well as our best-in-class manufactured housing and RV portfolio. For the year ended 2017, Sun delivered a 10% increase in core FFO per share as we drove industry-leading same-community revenue and NOIgrowth of 6% and 6.9%, respectively; saw a strong performance from the Carefree portfolio acquired in 2016, and added 9 operating communitiesto our portfolio during the year. We ended 2017 with total portfolio occupancy of 95.8%, providing ample room for continued occupancy gainsacross the portfolio.     solid operating backdrop, coupled with our strong balance sheet, led us to announce a 6% or $0.16 raise to Sun's common dividend of $2.68 to$2.84 for the 2018 fiscal year. I'd like to thank the Sun team for their dedication and hard work during 2017, and I look forward to continuing 2018 with great enthusiasm. Andwith that, I'd like to turn the call over to John and Karen to discuss our results and annual guidance in more detail.",False,True
728,64388775,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Sun Communities Inc Earnings Call,John Bandini McLaren,"Sun Communities, Inc.","Thank you, Gary. Before I begin sharing our performance metrics for the fourth quarter and the year, I wanted to note that our fourth quarterperformance was one of the strongest in our history. This level of performance would not have materialized without Sun's decades-long focus onsuperior customer service and the constant refinement of our operating systems. Sun delivered a total portfolio revenue increase of 10.7% in the quarter and 17.9% for the year. Revenue increases across our different businesslines were also strong with manufactured housing revenues increasing 6.6% for the quarter and 13.5% for the year. Inclusive of the approximate1,000 vacant manufactured housing expansion sites delivered during the fourth quarter, year-end manufactured housing occupancy was 94.6%.Even when taking into account these expansion site deliveries, 132 of our manufactured housing communities exhibit 98% occupancy or greater.We believe we have ample room in our portfolio to push manufactured housing occupancy higher and continue to deliver strong revenue growthfrom this business line. Annual RV revenues rose 14.1% for the quarter and 41.9% for the year. Transient RV revenues rose by 14.1% for the quarter and 34% for the year.Annual and transient RV revenues for Carefree included in total portfolio rose 14.6% and 1.3% for the fourth quarter. In addition, home sales revenues increased by 26.5% in the quarter and 15.3% for the year, as total homes sold increased by 3.5% for the year. Ouraverage new home selling price exceeded $118,000 for the quarter, with over 80% of new home sales occurring in Florida, South Carolina, Arizonaand Michigan. Along with a record average new home sales price for the fourth quarter, we also saw a margin improvement in new home sales of 170 and 100basis points for the quarter and the year, respectively. We gained over 2,400 revenue-producing sites in our total portfolio, an approximate 43%increase over nearly 1,700 revenue-producing site gains in 2016. 60% or approximately 1,400 of our gains were in manufactured homesites, and40% or just under 1,000 sites, where RV transient to annual conversions. Our same-community portfolio continues to deliver solid year-over-year growth resulting from the strategic positioning of the portfolio over thelast 5 to 7 years. Revenues rose 6.4% for the quarter and 6% for the year, driven by a 3.6% weighted average monthly rental rate increase and a190-basis point occupancy gain to 97.3%. This resulted in same-community NOI growth of 7% for the quarter and 6.9% for the year. Both revenue and NOI growth percentages exceeded our top end of our 2017 annual guidance range. Same-community manufactured housingrevenues rose 5.9% for the quarter and 5.7% for the year. For our same-community RV properties, revenues continued their upward trend withannual RV revenues increasing by 8.3% for the quarter and 7.8% for the year, while same-community transient RV revenues were up 4.5% for thequarter and 5.5% for the year. We've had a great start to the winter RV season, with budgeted first quarter 2018 reservations at 95%, ahead of this time last year by approximately7%. Overall, for the year, we expect to achieve a mid-5% revenue growth contribution from our same-community transient portfolio despite a 7%year-over-year expected decline in available transient sites. The decline in available site nights is a product for our transient site conversions to annual RV leases, where, as Gary has mentioned before, weexperienced a 40% to 60% revenue increase per site for the first full year after conversion. Our revenue management programs allow us to seeincreases in revenue per available site to rate an occupancy optimization. We have also seen a tremendous growth through our digital marketingefforts, where we engage you and repeat Sun guests through our broad range of social media and other traditional online campaigns.     In addition, we expect to complete the construction of approximately 1,350 expansion sites in 2018, with 1,000 manufactured housing expansionsites in 12 communities and over 350 RV sites across 4 resorts. Each of these operating metrics point to the exceptional capabilities of our operationsteam to drive growth for our shareholders while maintaining outstanding levels of customer service to our residents and guests. Sun enjoys a number of attractive fundamental tailwinds, the increasing cost of site-built housing, the limited supply of high-quality affordablehousing and the strong demand for manufactured housing and RV lifestyles, leaves Sun well positioned to deliver industry-leading internal growthfor the coming years.

729,64388775,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Sun Communities Inc Earnings Call,Karen J. Dearing,"Sun Communities, Inc.","Thanks, John. Sun reported $0.98 of core FFO per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, in line with our previously provided guidance.For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, core FFO per share was $4.17, up 10% from the prior year. Included in core FFO is an add-back forlost earnings, net of insurance deductibles from the Florida Keys properties damaged during Hurricane Irma, which totaled roughly $300,000 forboth the quarter and the year. These properties are out of service and are now part of our redevelopment pipeline. As Gary detailed earlier, we acquired 9 operating communities for a total of $145 million and 1 land parcel for approximately $6 million in 2017.Our deployment of roughly $150 million in acquisitions for the year is in keeping with our efforts to deepen our presence in the desirable andcomplementary markets. 5 of the communities were located in California, 2 in Florida and 2 in the Midwest. With respect to capital markets, we were very active in the fourth quarter and early 2018, retiring high coupon debt and preferred units. Thesetransactions included the November redemption of our $85 million Series A Preferred Stock that carried coupon of 7.125%, the December andJanuary redemptions of $8.6 million of Series B-3 units with a coupon of 8%, and the December defeasance of the $38.6 million mortgage with a5.25% fixed rate. Concurrent with the defeasance, we entered into a $100 million mortgage with an interest rate of 4.25% encumbered by the sameproperty. In January 2018, we have also retired $7.6 million of mortgages maturing in 2019, with a weighted average interest rate of 6.25%. Our forward debtmaturity schedule is well balanced and very manageable. During 2018, we have just $26.2 million of remaining loan maturities. We will continueto pursue the restructuring or paydown of liabilities maturing in 2018 and beyond to drive down our cost of funds. At December 31, 2017, Sun had $3.1 billion of debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 4.5% and a weighted average maturityof 8.9 years. Our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA was 6.3x, an attractive level that provides us the capacity to continue to supportour 2018 growth initiatives. On the equity side, we issued roughly 322,000 shares of common stock through our ATM program in the fourth quarter at a weighted averageprice of $93.33, raising roughly $30 million. The proceeds of the ATM issuance were used so match-fund our acquisitions in the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to guidance. For 2018, we expect full year core FFO per share in the range of $4.48 to $4.58, and core FFO per share for the firstquarter of $1.12 to $1.14. Additionally, please keep in mind the following considerations. On the operating front, we are expecting a same-communityweighted average rental rate increase of 3.8%, and expect to capture same-community occupancy growth of roughly 170 basis points during theyear. We are anticipating full year same-community NOI growth of 7% to 7.5%. The same-community portfolio has increased to 336 communitiesas compared to 231 communities in 2017, reflecting the inclusion of the Carefree portfolio. We are expecting an increase of 2,700 to 2,900 additional revenue-producing sites. Of the estimated revenue-producing site additions in 2018,approximately 2/3 are in manufactured housing sites and 1/3 in RV conversions from transient to annual leases. Our core FFO guidance includes an add-back for lost earnings from the 3 off-line Florida Keys communities, which we expect to recover throughthe business interruption insurance claim process. The estimate is based on historical NOI contributions from these properties and totals $1.3million or $0.015 per share for 2018.     I would also note that our guidance does not include any impact from prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities, which may be includedin analysts' estimates. Please refer to our supplemental document for additional guidance on home sales, same-community and core FFO seasonalityby quarter, general and administrative expenses, and other details.

Incorporated, Research Division","A quick question on the deals that were executed in the first -- sorry, in the fourth quarter. Can you give cap rates on those deals? And I guess, give,kind of, your update on what's out there in the transaction market? Whether anything has changed in terms of deal flow or I guess the volume ofopportunities that you're seeing?",True,False
732,64388775,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Sun Communities Inc Earnings Call,Gary A. Shiffman,"Sun Communities, Inc.","Yes, sure. There's an awful lot in each part of that question. I'll start with the easiest. The blended cap rate for the acquisitions in the fourth quarterwas 5.5%. And then moving on to a little bit of what Sun's pipeline looks like, I think that I would suggest that it just remains very, very constantand similar to what we've experienced for the last several years. And when you separate out the large portfolio transactions, in 2015, we did about$100 million of single-type acquisitions; in '16 income, about $200 million; and in '17, $150 million. So with the pipeline that we see in front of usright now, we would expect to be very, very similar to that average range in there. We're seeing and have under review manufactured housingboth age-restricted and all-age as well as RV resorts. I think we've got good, solid opportunity there. But I'd suggest that strategically we're very,very focused on acquiring properties that can grow at least equal to our current portfolio, if not value-add opportunities where we can accelerateoutsized growth through management of systems and experience over here, like we've done in the past. That being said, what do we see in themarket? I would share with everybody that we continue to see contracting cap rates. I think that fundamentally, there is a lot more interest in theasset category from both public and private investors. Generally, we talk about cap rates in the 5% to 7% range. And I can share with everybodythat we have seen transactions 100 to 150 basis points below that range and a lot less discernment between the quality of the assets. And eventhe fact of whether they're age-restricted, all-age or in fact, RV communities. So, we're seeing that compression take place out there. Haven't reallyseen any impact by interest rates, I think in large part due to the amount of equity interest in the asset class as well as the continued interest bylenders, I think, for all the fundamentals that characterize manufactured housing and the RV resort. So whether it be the life companies, CMBS, orother type of funding, it's still readily available and very, very competitive out there. So we're definitely very disciplined in what we're doing, butthe expectation from the existing pipeline we'll just continue to selectively acquiring properties as we've done over the past few years.",True,False

Or do you see that as -- I guess, why are homebuilders trying to, in some way, capture this opportunity as far as [its restraints], thingsholding them back, land scarcity.

So my thoughts on that, Drew, are -- it's -- obviously, within our communities, it's a whole different lifestyle, and it goes frankly, a little bitbeyond even the amenities. Amenities support it, and we've got a very, very healthy stack within our communities to do that. But really, it has todo with the experience that happens on the property. I think one of the other sort of distinctions between us and maybe some of this going on isthe fact that there are still -- when you're looking at stick-built single-family, the barrier to entry is higher from a financial outlay standpoint forsomebody to buy a single-family home as compared our product. And so when you look at sort of the square footage values that we have bycomparison, and then like I said, the amount that they have to pull out of pocket to that, I think it puts us into an advantage, because I don't -- theonly thing that really kind of -- and we've talked about this before, impact at us was before the mortgage crisis, when there was unqualified creditsthat were allowed to buy single-family homes.

Kim - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior Real Estate Analyst You guys mentioned in your prepared remarks about increasing your revenue-producing sites. Your main competitor in public space, DLF, saidpretty much does the same thing on expansion opportunities. What about the private owners? I mean, do you get a sense that they're expandingas quickly as possible just given the strength in the market? And how do you see new supply this year versus in recent years?",True,False

I think that we've shared before that in the backdrop of what we're aware of going on in our markets and across the country,there's certainly very little new greenfield development, although there is a pocket here or there we're starting to hear about right now. And Sun,of course, has been focused on the new development side. We're trying to deliver 2 to 3 communities per year. And other than that, nothing onthe new development. On the expansion side, I would say it's really unchanged. I can't point to anything, and I'd ask John, that it's different todaythat we see expansion-wise across the general board. We did note that our competitors, I think, were looking at expanding their communities ata rate probably much higher than in the past. And I think that as we've shared, it's a very healthy way for us to create growth, the fixed place -- fixedcosts are in place, and the margins are higher when we expand. But I can't really sit here and tell you that we are aware of a lot of other expansiontaking place out there. It does play a big role in acquisitions, as I've said before, where we can acquire properties that have contiguous land thateither comes with the acquisition or that we can acquire separately. It's strategically important for Sun to continue to gain that type of extra additivegrowth. So, what I would say is that most of what I see out there is opportunities on acquisitions that might have some embedded expansionopportunity in it, but not a lot that I see that's really taking place out there.

I may be aware of a handful, 3 to 5 communities, owners that I've spoken toin one way or another, either for acquisition purposes or other purposes, that might have expansions pending.

I would echo what you said before, too, Gary, which is that -- I mean, similar to what we're talking about what some of these -- withthe previous question today, I mean, the barrier to entry is difficult. The entitlement process is difficult, the zoning process is difficult. It can take12 to 24 months to get through that process. And so it's just -- it's hard to do, which I think plays into the fact why there's just not that much goingon. That's part of it. John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior Real Estate Analyst Okay. And then John, you mentioned that the 2018 RV reservations are at 95% in the fourth quarter and it's up 700 basis points.

But I think more important than that is really what we -- what happens at the resort itself, okay, and it's really -- it's thatexperience that happens on the ground. Because when we -- we have a lot of focus on service and the relationship that we have with our guestsand residents and what that turns into is really building your resident and guest sales force for your brand. And that by itself is our largest segmentof marketing that we have. And so it's -- it really is a product of that. And I think one of the things that really is the biggest example or thatdemonstrates that is the success that we've had in having guests that were transient guests become annual guests in our communities. We've had-- we grew by nearly 1,000 sites in 2017 with that conversion. And when they do that, I mean, they're committing to being there for the long-term.So that's I think -- again, I think what happens on the ground drives that the most. John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior Real Estate Analyst Okay. And then finally I had a question on your guidance, especially on the expense side it looks like property, operating and maintenance you'reexpecting 2.8% increase at the midpoint.

We don't have things to maintain like the apartment or multifamily does. The customer that ownstheir home is responsible for maintaining their own lawn, their own site. So the actual areas where we can come under pressure, I think, are justfewer.

And with much of that behind us right now, we did think it was in order to increasethe dividend for the shareholders. And I think part of that certainly was looking at AFFO and a lot of other metrics, seeing how the company ispositioned against the rest of the company's -- the REITs that are out there.

And it continues to be at the higher end of the 2% to 4% range that we'vegotten for the last 20-plus years. I think it's important to note that high occupancies provide multiple benefits. And one of the things I think thatdifferentiates Sun is our experience and expertise in filling vacant sites and creating additional avenues for growth. We create lease-up opportunitiesby expanding our existing communities, acquiring communities on an accretive basis with additional vacancies to fill and by building newcommunities. And really associated with the lease up of those occupancies that we buy or create are the multiple levers that we talk about thatdrive overall growth. Those levers are rent increases, but also include occupancy gains, home sales, conversion of transient RV sites to annualseasonal sites. And of course, rent increase drives solid year-over-year growth, but it's only one of those levers.

I think any dilution is kind of built in from the standpoint that in '17, we did 2,100 and'18, we'll be doing somewhat less. So, we would expect to see a slight pickup as these sites are filled versus the amount of capital being put out in2018 for new sites.

I think one ofthe things that I -- that -- really that process of having a rental home program is one of the things that fuels our sales overall and brings in newrevenue into Sun. And I think it's important to note that out of the 3,282 homes that we sold in 2017, which was a record, that 1,600, or nearly 50%of those homes were -- had previously been rented. And what does that do? Is it -- I think it's a strong indicator of the demand that we continueto see for our homes and our communities.

Edison International delivered excellent fourth quarter and full year results, but we faced significant challenges in December and into January ofthis year due to wildfires and the related legal and regulatory framework in California. Governor Brown recently referred to a new normal withrespect to wildfires and the fundamental risks this poses to our utility are top of mind at all levels of our company. I will discuss our strategy toaddress wildfire risk, but first, let me make a brief comment on our full year results. 2017 core earnings were $4.50 per share, which were $0.18 above the midpoint of our earnings guidance range and also well above consensusEPS. These results were driven by SCE's strong operating performance and additional tax benefits during the year. The EIX holding company alsohad better-than-expected cost performance in the fourth quarter and has contributed to our positive overall results. These results exclude thenoncore impact of tax reform and the revised SONGS settlement. Today, the Board of Directors of Edison International declared its first quarter common stock dividend of $0.605 per share. Prior to declaring thedividend, the Board evaluated the information available, including information pertaining to the wildfires in December 2017 and the mudslidesin Montecito in January 2018 and determined that the California law requirements for the declaration were met. Wildfires pose a risk statewide, impacting the entire economy. Communities across California have been tragically affected as climate change hasincreased its severity and the frequency of wildfires in recent years. Long-term droughts in California and forest management policies have resulted in the buildup of unmanaged vegetation. The state has nearly 130million dead trees on approximately 9 million acres due to prolonged drought conditions and bark beetle infestation. The combination of theseconditions along with decades of more buildings being permitted and constructed in higher fire risk areas have contributed to catastrophic wildfireswith 8 of the state's 20 most destructive wildfires having occurred in just the last 3 years. This is a statewide crisis that needs a statewide solution. We are engaged with state leaders, including the governor's office, legislative leaders andstakeholders across the economy on the solutions we believe are needed. First and foremost is the prevention and mitigation of catastrophic wildfires with sufficient fire suppression resources and effective policies aroundvegetation management, hazardous fuels reduction and zoning regulations for residential and commercial development in high fire risk areas.Second, our state's infrastructure must be hardened with stronger building codes in high fire risk areas. Utilities and other operators of criticalinfrastructure must also partner with state agencies on improved standards for climate-resilient infrastructure. As we think about how we design and operate our system, we should consider that roughly a quarter of our service territory is in designated highfire risk areas. This should evaluate the safety impacts along with the reliability and cost tradeoffs of steps like undergrounding more of thedistribution network in selected areas, installing steel or composite poles instead of wood ones in specific locations and using further preventivepublic safety shutoffs of power under high risk conditions such as red flag warnings, which we have done selectively in the past. Third, when a catastrophic event occurs, in spite of all these efforts, we need thoughtful policies around how financial risks are allocated, includingfire suppression costs and damages. As a reminder, California's courts have held investor-owned utilities strictly liable regardless of fault, for property damages and attorney's fees ifutility equipment is found to be a substantial cause of a wildfire. This means that the utility can do everything right in the operation and maintenanceof its equipment but still be on the hook for these costs. The California courts have held utilities liable regardless of fault by applying the principleof inverse condemnation, a principle typically applicable to government, not to private entities. The assumption is that like a government entity that can pass along to its taxpayer's costs and risks incurred for the public good, IOUs can socializewildfire costs among their customers in rates. However, as many of you know, the CPUC recently denied San Diego Gas and Electric's applicationfor cost recovery of about $380 million of costs above their insurance coverage.     With that, let me turn it over to Maria.",False,True
776,64389893,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call,Maria C. Rigatti,Edison International,"Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover fourth quarter and full year results for 2017 compared to the same period a year ago, our updated capital expenditureand rate base forecasts, updates on SCE's FERC formula rate filing and other financial updates for SCE and EIX. Our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results includes certain noncore charges related to the recent tax reform legislation as well as the revisedSONGS settlement. I will walk through both of these in a minute, but let's begin with a look at our core earnings drivers. For the fourth quarter 2017, Edison International reported core earnings of $1.10 per share, an increase of $0.13 from the same period last year. On the right side of Slide 2, you will see that SCE had a positive $0.14 core variance for the quarter versus the prior year. This is mainly attributableto $0.11 per share of increased revenue related to the attrition mechanism in SCE's 2015 General Rate Case. There were a number of changes on the expense side as well, although these were largely offsetting. SCE's operations and maintenance costs wereslightly higher due to the timing of maintenance activities. Net financing costs increased $0.01 per share over last year and was mainly due to $0.04of higher interest expense, partially offset by increased AFUDC earnings. Income tax benefits were $0.05 per share higher than last year and relatedto increased cost of removal benefits. Finally, other costs related to property taxes and corporate expenses were $0.03 higher. For the quarter, EIX parent and other had a negative $0.01 per share core earnings variance, arising from the lower tax benefits on stock-basedcompensation at the holding company, partially offset by improved results of $0.02 per share at our competitive businesses. As I noted earlier, SCE and EIX results in the fourth quarter were impacted by 2 significant noncore items, the revised SONGS settlement and taxreform. SCE had $1.48 per share of noncore charges in the fourth quarter. This relates to a $448 million after-tax charge or $1.38 per share associated withthe revised SONGS settlement and a $33 million charge or $0.10 per share related to tax reform. EIX parent and other had $1.29 per share of noncore charges in the fourth quarter, largely related to tax reform. Specifically, the remeasurementof deferred taxes resulted in a $433 million expense or $1.33 per share. We will continue to utilize our net operating losses and credits, and basedon our current analysis, EIX expects to become a cash taxpayer in 2025. Please turn to Page 3. Overall, for the full year, Edison International core earnings increased $0.53 per share over prior year. This includes $0.44 pershare of increased revenue related to the attrition mechanism in SCE's 2015 General Rate Case. Many of the earnings drivers for full year 2017 are similar to the quarter, so I will only highlight 2 items. At SCE, lower operation and maintenancecosts contributed $0.07 per share to overall performance over the prior year. Also, as we have communicated in previous quarters, EIX parent andother realized significant tax benefits in 2017 and the $0.17 per share increase in core earnings over the prior year is largely a result of these. For the year ended 2017, we have not recorded liability associated with the December wildfires. Given the preliminary stages of the investigationsand the uncertainty as to the causes and potential damages associated with the fires, we cannot determine that a liability is probable or a reasonablerange of possible losses that could be incurred. We will continue to update you as we have more information.     EIX and SCE continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility. At EIX, we issued a $500 million 1 year term loan inJanuary to partially pay down our commercial paper program. At SCE, our average common equity component of total capitalization was 50% asof December 31, including the charge from the revised SONGS settlement. If approved by the CPUC, the revised settlement allows SCE to exclude the $448 million after-tax charge from its equity capitalization ratio. As we have already discussed, tax reform results in a lower revenue requirement and lower customer rates, although rate base will increase as aresult of the elimination of bonus depreciation. Considering these items and given the potential for a large capital program based on our GRC request as well as other potential investments insupport of the state's clean energy objectives, we will likely see increased financing needs in the future as higher capital spending is followed byrelated growth in authorized rate base and earnings. We will continually assess the most cost effective approach to financing and could consider optimizing the use of short and long-term debt ateither EIX or SCE. We are pleased that we are able to benefit from the prudently conservative balance sheets we have maintained at both SCE and the holdingcompany as we continue to invest in SCE.

Obviously, over time, the Edison Energy number is one that we are working towards a breakeven run rate by the end of 2019, so that willbe part of the approach to minimize that drag. And at the holding company, tax reform has had an impact on us. While we believe that from adeductibility perspective, we'll be able to allocate that expense, the fact that we just had less of a tax shield as a result of the lower tax rate is havingan impact.

I knowthat we're not putting out a specific estimates that we may have or the like, and I also recognize that a number of analysts have put out their ownsets of ranges out there. But suffice it to say, we took a look at a good broad range of potential outcomes here based on the information we haveat hand and the board felt we're very comfortable making this quarterly dividend decision. In the normal course, we always update you on dividend actions. We typically have talked about potential adjustments in annual dividend levelsat the end of the year, but then we validate as a board and do actual board approval quarter-by-quarter. And that's again our normal course, andthat remains our normal course. So a quarter from now, we'll be having the next discussion on that quarterly dividend.

785,64389893,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call,Stephen Calder Byrd,"Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to talk about fire insurance. And I think you talked a bit about this in your prepared remarks. But just generally, as you think about thecost and availability of fire insurance, I guess, really both for you, but more broadly for your customers and for others in the region, we hear someconcerns about areas becoming uninsurable or costs rising significantly. How do you see that evolving in California? And I guess relatedly, do yousee a political awareness in the legislative body in terms of the need to be thinking about this holistically?",True,False
786,64389893,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Edison International Earnings Call,Pedro J. Pizarro,Edison International,"This is Pedro. And I'll start this one and Maria or others may want to comment from the management team. First of all, you have to date up this insurance forms that we purchased, as Maria described in her comments. I think it's safe to say that's probablythe most expensive premium we've paid for insurance ever. So that alone is a data point on -- there was availability, but at a much steeper costthan we've seen before. And as we continue to head into the market to secure different elements, different tranches of our towers, we are continuingto see a very tight market. But to your point on awareness, that's frankly part of our job right now, to make sure that we are making policymakers aware and we're fullyengaged on that. I mentioned in my remarks that we are engaged with the entire community of policymakers out there, from the governor's office,through to key legislators. We are doing a lot of that jointly with other utilities or other groups that are I think aware of the issues here across thestate. And again, it's part of not just a utility issue, it's part of a statewide issue here that we think the severity and the frequency of these firescontinues to go the way it's gone over the last 3 years. It's going to continue to put added pressure on the insurance market and other parts of theeconomy. So we've taken it on ourselves to make sure that we are knocking on a whole lot of doors in Sacramento right now, making sure folksare aware and bringing some of our ideas to the table of what reforms might be needed to solve this statewide issue.

When we filed our GRC, people were very appreciative of the$85 million in O&M costs that we had taken out of the system and this sort of insurance premium completely swamps that. And it does get recoveredin our General Rate Cases, we applied for that, so customers will ultimately bear very high costs unless and until we can make people aware of theissue.",True,False

And you've seen, as I mentioned in my comments, we joined with PG&E in filing the application for the hearing in the San Diego WEMA case.We filed an amicus in the PG&E Butte case. So I think there's a recognition that the broader themes around policy and moving beyond just inversecondemnation, that support for a number of actions across the economy, across fire prevention and hardening infrastructure and costs and riskallocation, those are ones where at that 10,000-foot level it's so important that we be aligned, and we are.",True,False

Pizarro,Edison International,"Well, again, this is one where, I think, we can give you a sense of that will take time, but it's very hard to pin down, here's the calendar or here'sfacing high ends at this very early stage. But let's take it in pieces. There are legal strategies, and so those play themselves out in individual cases.And I mentioned the Butte case with PG&E or the Round fire case where we made our filing, right? So there's a track around each of those cases.There's a PUC regulatory track, right? And I don't think that we have a clarity yet in terms of the timing for the PUC to consider the various applicationsfor rehearing in that San Diego WEMA case or the PG&E WEMA case activity there. So typical and I'm looking around at Ron Nichols here, but typicalCPUC time lines, certainly, it can be in the many months to a couple of years sort of time frame. Then finally, to the extent that legislative policy changes attract something that we're also looking at, that happens in cycles of legislative sessions.And so we have a session that runs through later this year. It's a possibility of next year's session. So we -- I will tell you we are certainly advocatingabout the sense of urgency on this, and we would love to see traction in this legislative session on some of these key pieces, but it's still early daysand that's not guaranteed. As I mentioned in my comments, the deadline for bills has passed, but you can still get changes in those vehicles. So     there's always a possibility that as we continue to engage with legislators, we could see changes in the vehicles that are available already and billsthat have been filed. So that could be a this year thing or it might take longer to help build the momentum and build the case and it could extend into the next legislativesession.

There's this broader track around -- the state has an issue. It's a big issue.Part of the issue is this -- the concern about the application of inverse condemnation feasibility, so the issue is broader than that, as I mentionedearlier. And so we're really looking for a broader, statewide solution. Now clearly, there's a connection between these, right? And so if we had a very speedy resolution, and I think that would be wishing for a lotbecause we do expect this will take time. But let's say that we have clarity up front in terms of there's a bill that gets passed next month that resolvesthe application of inverse, well then it clearly would have some impact on -- once the Cal Fire investigation concludes, that would have impact onthe recourse it means we would have to get recoveries for damages. But again, I don't think that there's a serial linkage where we have to wait for that Cal Fire investigation of the Thomas fire to conclude in order towork the various other paths, regulatory, legislative paths to try and resolve the broader statewide issue.

I'll begin today by briefly discussing some of our 2017 key accomplishmentswhich are highlighted on Slide 4. In a year that began with a great deal of uncertainty, with anticipated industry excess capacity leading to bearish module ASP projections coupledwith the challenges that came with our Series 6 transition, I am pleased with our focus, execution and ability to exceed our earnings and cash flowcommitments for the year. 2017 was a record year with net bookings of 7.7 gigawatts DC with Series 6 representing 2.6 gigawatts DC of the bookings. Contracting this businessis an outstanding accomplishment and provides improved clarity to ramp and grow our Series 6 production over the coming years. In addition tostrong bookings in the U.S., we saw strength in international markets led by Australia, Japan, India and Europe, where we booked over 1.7 gigawatts. While strong demand in China and the 201 trade case in the U.S. helped to firm up the macro environment, our collaborative approach to workingwith customers and the progress we've made towards the launch of our Series 6 module were key contributors to achieving these record bookings. O&M bookings were also strong last year as we added nearly 2.9 gigawatts of projects, bringing our total O&M fleet under contract to 8.5 gigawatts.Notably, nearly 2/3 of the megawatts booked were in projects where we were not the developer. Successfully winning O&M on projects notdeveloped by First Solar opens our addressable market, which helps create scale for O&M business and thereby enhances our competitive position.Our O&M fleet continues to perform at the highest level with effective availability of 99.6% in 2017. There were also a number of notable achievements in our technology, manufacturing and EPC operations last year. Specific to our Series 6 product,as we highlighted at our Analyst Day, we manufactured our first complete module at our factory in Ohio late last year. This target was reachedahead of schedule and represents tremendous achievement by our entire technology and manufacturing teams. While focused on the development of our Series 6 product, improvement to our Series 4 product continued to roll through our production fleetlast year. Our full year 2017 Series 4 fleet average efficiency increased 50 basis points to 16.9% as compared to 2016. The increase in efficiency,coupled with reductions in material and labor cost, enabled us to improve the cost per watt of our Series 4 modules by 14% from the prior year.Note this is significantly better than our 9% reduction targeted for the year. Recently, we achieved a significant manufacturing milestone as we produced our 200 millionth module since the inception of the company. Thisaccomplishment is attributed to the dedication and commitment of our manufacturing associates worldwide. We've had tremendous learningsalong this high-value manufacturing journey which has resulted in one of the most differentiated technologies in the industry. Since 2008, we'veseen a greater than 40% improvement in line throughput, a more than 50% increase in module efficiency and a reduction of cost per watt of over70%. These results are truly remarkable. In addition, we continue to make excellent progress on driving down the balance of system cost. Relative to our expectation at the beginning of2017, we have lowered the projected balance of system cost per watt by 20% on major projects that we will be constructing in 2018. This improvementis a result of lower labor cost from utilizing Series 6 modules as well as taking a comprehensive value stream approach to driving down all aspectsof BoS cost. With over 7.5 gigawatts of cumulative modules installed, the extensive experience of our EPC team provides not only tremendous benefit to ourcaptive project pipeline but is also a key component of the power plant solutions we offer to corporate and utility customers. As a result of thestrong Series 4 bookings, the cost per watt improvements made and by executing on our key system project sales, we achieved 2017 earningsadjusted for the onetime impact of tax reform and restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2.59 per share, which is in the high end of ourguidance range. With over $1.3 billion in operating cash flow generated and an ending net cash balance of $2.6 billion, we further enhanced ourindustry best balance sheet. In late 2016, when we announced the acceleration of our Series 6 road map, one of our key objectives was to ensure sufficient liquidity throughoutthis process. Thus far, we are tracking extremely well against this objective as measured by our net cash at the end of 2017. The net cash position",False,True
840,64389867,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call,Alexander R. Bradley,"First Solar, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. Turning to Slide 9. I'll begin by discussing our fourth quarter operational highlights, and keep in mind that the metrics provided arereflective of Series 4 manufacturing only. Module production increased slightly in the fourth quarter to 532 megawatts DC, a 1% increase from Q3. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016,production is lower as a result of ramping down certain Series 4 lines in Ohio and Malaysia to make way for Series 6 production. Capacity utilization,which makes adjustments for the lines taken out of service, was 99%. Our fourth quarter fleet and best line conversion efficiency were unchangedversus the prior quarter at 17%. This will be the last quarter we'll report Series 4 efficiency since we'll remain relatively unchanged going forward.And in future quarters, as Series 6 enters production, we will modify the operational metrics to provide the most relevant information. I'll next discuss some of the income statement highlights of our fourth quarter on Slide 10. This will include some non-GAAP measures such asadjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. And please refer to the Appendix inthe earnings presentation for the accompanying GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $339 million, a decrease of $748 million compared to the prior quarter. The expected decrease in net sales wasdue to both lower systems and third-party module sales. Systems project sales are much higher in Q3 due to the initial revenue recognition of theCalifornia Flats and Cuyama projects. For the second phase of California Flats as well as other development projects scheduled to reach COD in2018, which will optimize the Series 6 modules, there was minimal systems activity in Q4 of 2017. Projects such as Rosamond and Willow Springs,which are scheduled to be completed in 2018, have not yet been sold and therefore do not have any revenue recognized in Q4. Both these projectsare progressing well through the sale process. For full year 2017 net sales were $2.94 billion, a 1% increase versus the prior year. Relative to our net sales guidance for '17, our actual sales areslightly lower as a result of certain project sales in India that moved into 2018. As mentioned on our last earnings call, there was some uncertaintyas the timing of when these projects would be sold. While we did close the sale of the 35 megawatts in 2017, the remaining projects are nowexpected to be sold this year. At a percentage of total quarterly net sales, our system revenue in Q4 was 39% as compared to 72% in Q3. For the full year 2017, 73% of net salesfrom our systems business compared to 77% in 2016. As I indicated at our Analyst Day in December, we have modified over segment reporting inorder to better align with our internal analysis of the business and also to reflect the expected increase in third-party module sales as we rampmanufacturing capacity in the coming years. The module segment now includes only module sales to third parties and the system segment willinclude all revenue from the sale of solar power systems including the module. These changes offset in reporting will be fully reflected in our 10-K. Gross margin decreased to 18% in the fourth quarter from 27% in Q3 primarily as a result of the low gross profit projects realized. For the full year,gross margin was 19%. Adjusted operating expenses, which exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges, were $99 million in the fourthquarter, an increase of $15 million compared to Q3. More than half of the increase is due to higher production startup as Series 6 activities accelerated. For 2017, adjusted operating expenses were $334 million in line with our guidance. Combined SG&A and R&D expense decreased by 25% versus2016 despite higher variable compensation in Q4 of '17, and this reduction of $95 million is a significant 1-year reduction and demonstrates thepositive impact of our focused restructuring efforts. Excluding restructuring and asset impairments, we had an adjusted operating loss of $37 million in the fourth quarter compared to an adjustedoperating profit of $208 million in the third quarter. The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily due to lower net sales and higherproduction startup expenses. For full year 2017, our adjusted operating income was $215 million. Before discussing income tax expense for the fourth quarter, it's important to understand the impact of the U.S. tax reform legislation that wassigned into law in December 2017. The new tax law, amongst other changes, lowered the statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%,imposing mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introduced new tax regime and changed our foreign earningsthat's subject to U.S. tax.",False,True

We're also starting to see the announcement we had with APS and thePV-plus-storage. We're seeing a lot more of that opportunity in the marketplace right now.

845,64389867,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call,Philip Lee,Wei Shen,"First one here is on ASPs. We've heard some chatter that you may be trying to increase ASPs on existing bookings post 201. Your module pricingis up incrementally following the tariffs. Do you have any wiggle room in your contracts to increase your ASPs for your 7.7 gigawatts of bookingsthrough year-end '17? Or are they locked in? And also, does your 1.3 gigs in 2018 year-to-date reflect any of the higher pricing that the market hasexperienced? Secondarily, we're also hearing that there may be some additional Series 6 capacity coming available for customers. Is this primarilydue to the additional Vietnam facility you talked about in December? Or are you contemplating yet another capacity expansion? I know you havea lot in your plate with launching 5 facilities over 3 years, but what would it take to add yet another gigawatt of capacity sometime in the nextcouple of years? Is that even realistic?",True,False
846,64389867,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call,Mark R. Widmar,"First Solar, Inc.","Yes. So on the ASP, I'll start with that first, Phil. I mean, again, the way we structured our contracts, that 7.7 gigawatt that you referenced, they werefirm, typically enforceable obligations between both counterparties. So those ASPs were firm fixed price ASPs in both directions, so there is noroom to move relative to that. And we're very happy with how we contracted that volume. So it's always one of those things you could look backin hindsight and say should you have done anything differently. I'm very happy with what we did. I think we did everything we should have andwe did the right thing and best positioned us not only to best serve the needs of our customers but to enable the company and continue to grow.As it relates to the 1.3 gigawatts that we booked since the beginning of the year, I mean, clearly, the business that has not been booked in the 1.3is a carryforward as we started beginning of this year with the clarity around the 201 case. We engaged the market and we get market prices atthat point in time. So is there room potentially around Series 6 in particular to get maybe slightly better ASPs than we would have recognizedpreviously and then the 7.7 gigawatts or I guess the 2.6 that we booked to Series 6 last year? Clearly, there's always that opportunity. But it's --again, it's a balanced take around how we engage with our customers from that perspective. But it's always we want to make sure that we're giving     them the best quality, the best technology, enable them to be successful and to make sure we're getting the fair value for the technology thatwe're providing. As it relates to the Series 6 capacity, we -- there are no firm commitment to this point in time to do anything but what we've alreadyindicated during our Analyst Day. Now what I will say, though, and Alex alluded to this a little bit in his remarks, as we look at the tax reform andwhat's happening now with the U.S. corporate tax rate when you look at the media expensing, there's optionality potentially or there are scenarioslike -- or maybe it's a better we to say that we would look to -- in the U.S. to have additional manufacturing as part of our overall scenario analysisacross the global production platform, looking at the U.S. as a different lens that it would have otherwise before tax reform. And there is somecapability that potentially says that we could get -- if we made a decision to produce in the U.S. could we get some additional capacity betweennow and, say, the 2020 or 20 -- beginning of 2020 time frame. Can we get a little bit more capacity? Potentially. It depends on how things play out.At this scenario, we're going to continue to evaluate, no commitment at this point in time. But it wouldn't be in order of magnitude of 1 gigawatt.We're talking a few hundred megawatts or so from that perspective. Nothing around Series 6 that would capture 1 gigawatt of upside over, say,the next 2 years or so.",True,False

So I guess if you look atthe time line, we're about a month -- less than a month I guess from when that actual final decision was made. We had a significant amount ofmomentum going into the bookings. Even before the announcement from -- the final decision. Now clearly there was indication of potential impactaround 201 case. Tariffs were being proposed by the commissioners to the president. So there has been indications in the marketplace -- strongerindications as we progress to the second half of '17 clearly. And we've -- as we indicated as well, even in our mid- to late-stage pipeline, I mean,we've got over 1 gigawatt of basically negotiated volume that sits within that pipeline just (inaudible). So what I would say is as you look at theprofile of the bookings as they evolve, let's say from the middle of '17 through today as well as plus what's in our mid- to late-stage pipeline as wecontinue to move across that continuum, clearly, the indication of the overhang or the concern, I guess, maybe it's a better way to say it, of theimpact of 201 continue to increase over that horizon. But the other thing I want to make sure it's clear is we said this before. We have engaged our     customers and we've done this in a risk-sharing approach, and we have not tried to do anything that would be opportunistic or to create someform of windfall benefit to First Solar. And we look at this overall industry as having tremendous growth and potential. It is a marathon. It is not asprint. We want to have long-term relationships with our customers. We'll treat them fairly and we'll continue to give them the best technology inthe industry and provide the best power plant solutions and maintaining those power plant solutions over their anticipated life cycle.

854,64389867,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call,Mark R. Widmar,"First Solar, Inc.","I'm sorry. I think there was one other question on PVS. I'm sorry, I just want to make sure I got that one as well. Look, I think the deal that we'vedone with APS, I think it's unique in the fact that -- and different than anything else that has been done so far. The PPA with APS is for 100% of thebattery components of the energy generation. It's all for power that are being delivered in the early evening hours. It was part of an all resourceRFP, where we competed head-to-head with mainly gas figures. They were looking for generation that was going to be dispatched in the, call it,the 3 to 8 or even after 8:00 p.m. type of window. So we're generating the PV during the day. We're storing the energy in the batteries and thenwe're dispatching it at a point in time of when there's the greatest need for that energy in the evening hours. And so that's creating a completelydifferent value proposition and kind of is changing the game around what are the fundamental economics of solar. It's not just looking at powergeneration during the middle of the day. It's saying what can we do to create -- enhance value by having truly reliable, dispatchable, controllablesolar in the evening hours. So it's -- I think that more and more utilities will continue to evaluate what we've done there. I think you'll see more andmore momentum. We are continuing to see a tremendous amount of interest from our customers around thinking about storage. And whether itsits today as part of the power plant or to look at the long-term optionality around how to integrate storage at some future date, that createsoptionality that they may want to take advantage of in the future especially in markets where the solar penetration is much lower than it is, say, inCalifornia or even here in Arizona. But it's those types of kind of forward-looking and thought leadership kind of value propositions that we're ableto create with our customers. And I think there will be a lot of interest and people wanting to learn more about what we've done with APS, andwe're already getting some inquiries from customers.",True,False

So I think at the Analyst Day, you talked about 13.75 gigawatts of cumulative shipments between '18 and '20. I guess you'vegot 9.1 gigawatts of that booked now. Where does that go with the Ohio decision that you made? And then also I think it was in the -- buried inthe footnotes, but can you just touch on the 700 megawatts of de-bookings that you saw during the year?",True,False
857,64389867,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call,Mark R. Widmar,"First Solar, Inc.","Yes. So right now, the way I would look at the -- if you look at the decision that we're going to continue to run 2 lines in Perrysburg, at this point intime, think of it as a commitment for this year. So there's another, call it, a couple of hundred megawatts that we would -- in the supply plan relativeto what we would have said in the Analyst Day. We will continue to evaluate that production as we exit this year, do so we continue to run it into'19, do we carry it into '20? If we did it across all 3 years, then you're talking in the range of about 600 megawatts if we chose to do that. So that's-- if you think of it right now 200 megawatts, that's what we're committing to. We'll continue to evaluate when we make a decision to run thatproduction longer than that. And relative to the 700 of de-bookings, the largest one that we had during the year was a project which went by a     couple of different names, either Tribal Solar or Fort Mojave depending on -- I'm not sure exactly what we -- how we called it in our SEC filings. Sothat was a PPA that we had with California utility. And because of various reasons, the viability around that project, we ended up terminating thatPPA. So that was the picture. Then there was a handful of module agreements that we entered into, almost framework agreements that as welooked at the viability of those framework agreements relative to incremental demand that we were seeing in the marketplace for our Series 4product, there was an agreement between both parties that we terminated those framework agreements.

Have prices gone down or up relative to whatyou guys were looking at late, late last year? And then as far as the 8point3 announcement goes, you guys at the time made some commentsaround a challenging outlook for the utility scale power market just in terms of the fall of pricing, et cetera.

860,64389867,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call,Mark R. Widmar,"First Solar, Inc.","Yes, let me -- I'll answer the 201 and then Alex can take the question on margin and 8point3. One thing that I want to go back to, the one questionaround the de-bookings. I want to make sure that it's clear that those de-bookings were bookings that we had on our backlog. Actually in one case,those bookings came in I think in 2015 -- the Tribal Solar I think was around 2015. The other framework agreements were 2016, okay? They hadnothing to do with any of the contracts that we have entered into in 2017. So as we've made comments that those are firm, enforceable obligationswith penalties, liquidation damages associated, these de-bookings had nothing to do with that because I know we continue to get asked thequestion are these truly enforceable contracts. And I don't want the conclusion to be it's all de-bookings. No, this is an indication those truly werenot enforceable contracts. Nothing there was de-booked. Anything to do with anything we recognized in 2017, these were all much older contractsfrom that standpoint. As it relates to the 201 case, Vishal, we've -- as I tried to indicate before, we're trying to find a way that we can find a win-winfor our customers. We want to make sure that their projects are viable, that we're getting fair value for the technology. It also allows us to besomewhat selective with who we choose to engage with in a highly creditworthy type of counterparties and others. So we can be more selectivefrom that perspective and giving the best technology that enables their business model which, obviously, enables ours as well in the other things.We're booking, as we indicated. But if you look at the mid- to late-stage pipeline, our bookings profile dips out in 2020 and really almost towardsthe end of 2020 and even in 2021. Those are somewhat uncharted territory for us. So for me to tell you what that pricing looks like relative to beforeand after the 201, it's hard for me to give you a line of sight for that because that momentum has only started to happen over, I would say, the lastquarter or so. So you can't really indicate movement one way or the other because we're largely sold out through '18, '19 and the first half of 2020right now. So our bookings opportunities are that much further out in the horizon. What I'll tell you is that when I look at those -- on the ASPs thatare out there, relative to our road map of Series 6 and where we're going with that technology, I'm pleased. I think it lines up with all of ourexpectations in that regard. So I'll let Alex answer the other 2.",True,False
861,64389867,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 First Solar Inc Earnings Call,Alexander R. Bradley,"First Solar, Inc.","Yes. So Vishal, regarding the margins, I mean, the margin profile that we gave at our Analyst Day I think still holds. So what you're seeing is perhapsa slight increase in margin, but this here is a function of some of the systems projects that we have. We're still pleased where the margins are inSeries 4 products, which are in line with what we guided to in December. Around 8point3 and the challenging outlook potentially at that utilityscale market, I'd say, look, as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, we ran a very comprehensive process. Over 130 potential buyers werecontacted. And while we clearly would have liked to have got to a better outcome in terms of price, we do believe it's the best deal out there in     the market. But it's a little bit different from how we look at future utility scale deals. So there's a bit of a difference in that situation. At the time wewere out marketing 8point3, you had -- NRG yield was also in the market, which added a little bit in terms of a less competitive situation. You'dalways rather have less assets rather than more in the market at the same time. We also had the Southern Company that owned the majority interestin a lot of the projects in 8point3 were out marketing a piece of their broader solar portfolio at the same time. 8point3 has minority ownership insome of the projects, and therefore, that's different to buyer who can purchase a new project outright and have a controlling interest. You alsohave a mix of utility scale as well as there's resi and C&I projects in that portfolio. The capital structure of 8point3 today had non-amortizing debt,so that would have to be replaced in time in amortizing as you sold that portfolio. The asset level structures were already in place around the taxequities. There's less flexibility for a new buyer there, and there's also some less flexibility of optimizing other value streams to buyers around O&Mfor instance.",True,False

So there's -- Tyler, there's a lot of moving pieces in there and I'm not give you kind of a margin range. But what I'll say is look, as we moveforward, when we transition everything into Series 6 as an example, we've eliminated the form factor delta and the higher BoS cost, right? So nowwe've got a product that is a form factor equivalent and BoS neutral, right, potentially advantaged depending on the application and with anenergy yield advantage. So that creates a tremendously competitive product that as we move from 4 into 6 would give us opportunity to see grossmargin expansion. There's no doubt about that. In terms of what does that profile look like, there's still way too many to moving pieces at this pointin time to represent that. But the other thing I want to make sure, and we've highlighted this in the Analyst Day is the -- if you're talking grossmargin versus op margin, I think op margin. And if we can manage to scale against our fixed cost structure, we're going to see very strong contributionmargin leveraged against a fixed cost structure through OpEx that's going to drive op margin expansion. So growth and scale will be more impactfulas it relates to op margin expansion per se than just the transition from 4 to 6 and whether or not where my ASP versus cost entitlement is aroundSeries 6. That's going to be a critical enabler but equally if not -- and like I said, probably more importantly, it's going to be our ability to scale againstour fixed cost to drive op margin expansion.",True,False

This morning, we released our fiscal 2018 second quarter financial results, and I'm proud to report our 10th consecutive quarter of improvedyear-on-year profitability. We increased pretax earnings by 20.4% compared to the second quarter of last year.",False,True
870,64388528,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q2 2018 Brady Corp Earnings Call,Aaron James Pearce,Brady Corporation,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. The financial review starts on Slide #3. Sales increased 7.4% to $287.8 million in the second quarter, which consisted of organic sales growth of 3.2% and an increase of 4.2% from foreigncurrency translation. We remain committed to R&D, and this quarter, we once again increased our investments in new product development. R&D expense was $11.3million, which is an increase of 19.3% over the second quarter of last year. We continued our trend of increased earnings this quarter, as pretax earnings were up 20.4% to $35 million compared to $29.1 million in last year'ssecond quarter. This profit improvement was primarily driven by organic sales growth in IDS and profitability improvements in both our IDS and WPS businesses,along with our constant focus on driving efficiencies throughout our G&A structure. Net earnings finished at $4.3 million this quarter compared to $25.3 million last year. In last year's second quarter, we benefited from alower-than-normal income tax rate of 13%, which was caused by certain onetime tax benefits from a large cash repatriation. This year, we recognizedadditional tax expense of $21.1 million or approximately $0.40 of EPS as a result of the U.S. tax legislation that was enacted in December. Withoutthis tax charge, our EPS would have been $0.48 this quarter. Lastly, cash flow from operating activities was $7.7 million this quarter compared to $19.3 million in last year's second quarter, and free cash flowwas $3 million this quarter compared to $16 million in last year's second quarter. Slide #4 details our quarterly sales trends. Again, total sales grew 7.4% and organic sales grew 3.2% versus the second quarter of last year. Thisquarter marks our third consecutive quarter of total company organic sales growth. We're gaining momentum, and we're focused on executingour strategy to continue this trend of growth for the rest of the fiscal year. On Slide #5, you'll find an overview of our gross profit margin trending. Our gross profit margin was 49.9% this quarter, which is a decrease of 20basis points compared to last year's gross profit margin of 50.1%. We're continuing to identify and execute efficiency opportunities throughout our global operations, which is effectively offsetting pricing challengesin certain product categories. Moving along to Slide #6, you'll find our SG&A expense trending. SG&A was $97.6 million this quarter compared to $94.7 million in the secondquarter of last year. This increase was entirely due to foreign currency translation. In fact, in constant currencies, our SG&A expense was downapproximately $1 million or 1%. We remain focused on improving our processes and driving our waste throughout our SG&A structure. We're reinvesting a portion of these savingsback into direct sales and marketing resources that will help drive future sales, while the remainder of the efficiency gains are helping deliveraccelerated bottom line growth. Slide #7 details our increased investment in R&D. We've increased our R&D expenditures both in absolute dollars and as a percent of sales againthis quarter. Our commitment to growing organic sales over the long term involves a steady introduction of highly innovative proprietary products.We believe that investing back in Brady to the development of innovative new products that add significant value to our customers are theinvestments that will have the highest rate of return and are essential to our long-term success. R&D expense was up 19.3% this quarter, and we expect this trend to continue with our full fiscal year 2018 expense expected to be up approximately15% when compared to last year.     And third, we need to assess the recoverability of the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our foreign tax credit carryforwards. The summary of the impact of all of these items, along with the reassessment of our search in related to permanently invested foreign earnings,makes up our tax charge of $21.1 million. As we look at our future tax rates, there are also a few items to point out. First, the way that the tax bill was written is such that there are certainaspects that could phase in for a non-calendar year-end company such as Brady. This includes the reduction in tax rates. As such, our U.S. federal tax rate this year will drop from the statutory rate of 35% to 26.9%. Then, on August 1, 2018, our U.S. federal tax rate willfurther drop to the headline rate of 21%. The impacts of this rate reduction and the provisional expense that we booked this quarter may also require further refinance to our tax expenselater this fiscal year. Also, there are numerous pieces of tax legislation that don't become effective for Brady until August 1, 2018. As such, the tax rate that we'll see in our third and fourth quarters of this year will not necessarily be indicative of our ongoing future tax rates. Excluding the impact of the tax charges recorded this quarter and any further noncash adjustments in Q3 or Q4 related to this legislation, we expectthat our tax rate will be approximately 27% to 29% for the full year ending July 31, 2018. And then, beyond this fiscal year, we expect that ourlonger-term tax rates will decline from our historical ranges of 27% to 29% to a new range of 25% to 27%. Slide #12 summarizes our guidance for the full fiscal year ending July 31, 2018. We're updating our full year diluted EPS guidance range from ourcurrent range of $1.85 to $1.95 to our new fiscal 2018 guidance range of $1.90 to $2 per share, exclusive of the tax charge that I just mentioned. Our increased guidance is a result of 2 primary factors. First, is to reflect our stronger operating results, as our organic sales have improved and wecontinue to make strides in driving efficiencies throughout our business. Embedded in these improved operating results are further increases inour R&D spend as we now anticipate R&D cost to be up approximately 15% this year. Second, we anticipate benefiting from the weakened dollar against certain other major currencies, including the euro. Although weaker dollarversus currencies such as the Chinese yuan can be a negative for us, in general, Brady benefits from a weaker dollar. Included in our F '18 guidance is low-single-digit organic sales growth, which will be driven by continued strength in our ID Solutions business.Our guidance is based on foreign currency exchange rates as of January 31, 2018, and includes other key operating assumptions, includingdepreciation and amortization expense of approximately $26 million and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million. Our capital expenditure plan decreased as we no longer expect that the purchase of certain strategic facilities will occur this year. We're notanticipating any restructuring charges, and we're not excluding any onetime item from this guidance other than the $21 million of tax chargesthat I just mentioned. I'll now turn the call back to Michael to cover our divisional results. Michael?",False,True
871,64388528,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q2 2018 Brady Corp Earnings Call,J. Michael Nauman,Brady Corporation,"Thank you, Aaron. Slide #13 summarizes the Identification Solutions' second quarter financial results. IDS sales increased by 8.1% this quarter,finishing at $206.4 million, with organic sales improving 4.7% and with foreign currency translation increasing sales by another 3.4%. Organic sales growth was led by EMEA and Asia, with both regions posting growth in the high single digits, while organic sales increased in theAmericas in the low single digits in the quarter.     We believe this will help to further stabilize margins and return the business to consistent profitable growth. We're continuing to take action toimprove the WPS business' organic sales growth through 3 priorities. First, we're working to improve the buying experience for our customers sothat it is simple as possible, reaching our customers in a way they would like to be reached, whether it's online, mobile, catalog or in person, isessential to gain market share and grow this business. Second, we're increasing our customer interaction to provide more value than simply filling orders. This allows us to understand what our customersare dealing with from a safety and identification standpoint, and to better serve those needs by offering our compliance expertise and completesolutions. Third, one of our strengths is our ability to customize and quickly turn orders around to our customers. So we're improving our portfolio of productsby introducing more customized and proprietary products that our customers need while providing them with our extensive safety and complianceexpertise. Segment profit in the WPS business was $7.1 million compared to $6.1 million in last year's second quarter, an increase of 16.4%. As a percentage of sales, segment profit was 8.7% this quarter compared to 7.9% in last year's second quarter. We continue to address our coststructure throughout the global WPS segment, and we're investing in sales-generating resources while streamlining processes and reducing thecost of previous orders at the same time. These are the drivers of our improved financial results this quarter. Our expectations for WPS financial performance for the full year are unchanged. We expect organic sales to be approximately flat, and that segmentprofit will continue to be in the high single digits as a percentage of sales. I'm proud of what we've accomplished halfway through fiscal 2018. We're off to a good start, and we're gaining momentum. We've delivered 3straight quarters of organic sales growth and 10 straight quarters of pretax profit growth, and we're capitalizing on new opportunities every singleday. That's a trend. But we have more work to do. We need to keep improving on underperforming businesses, and we need to invest in selling and R&D resources,while at the same time driving operational excellence throughout Brady. We believe we will continue to face pricing pressures in both our WPSand our health care product lines in IDS, which makes our investments in innovation and new products all more important to our long-term success. We continue to push decision-making further into the company, and the impact of this culture shift is apparent in our financial results, reducingcomplexity in our global structure, and we're moving barriers so that our local managers can think, decide and act on their feet on a daily basis hasbeen empowering and motivating for the team. We're constantly working to identify and eliminate nonvalue activities that are not part of designing a product, making a product or serving ourcustomers. We're directly in support of those efforts. I'm proud of our results halfway through fiscal 2018, but we're not letting up as an organization. I'm motivated to push for more, and I know thatthe entire Brady team is motivated and excited for what the future will bring. I know that we can exceed our goals and continue to deliver whatwe've promised to our customers, our employees and our shareholders. I'd now like to start the Q&A.

So you continue to guide towards this low single-digit growth. We're sort of in the mid-single digits for thefirst half of the year and seems like end markets are trending well. And you've always talked about how that sort of segment and sort of maybe a     GDP x2 type of a business which would sort of trend at sort of a mid-single digit. So I'm just wondering, is there any reason to be cautious headinginto the back half of the year regarding organic growth to IDS?",True,False

We definitely feel strongly that we are putting in place the right type of new product development tocontinue our growth curve. I believe that we've actually spoken about GDP plus 2, not x2, rates of growth in that business. But that doesn't meanthat we aren't optimistic at all. To the contrary, we believe that the economy is getting stronger and that we have the products to take advantageof that and continue to grow at a rate above GDP.",True,False
882,64388528,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q2 2018 Brady Corp Earnings Call,Joseph Logan Mondillo,"Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And I asked the question regarding the balance sheet last quarter. You guys continue to sort of maintain sort of this discipline/patientmentality. Just wondering, the balance sheet continues to improve, cash flow, as you noted in your commentary, it looks like it's going to continueto trend really well, so the balance sheet should continue to improve. Your operating have sort of an insufficient -- or inefficient capital structure.Just wondering if there's any update regarding your thinking on the balance sheet?",True,False
883,64388528,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q2 2018 Brady Corp Earnings Call,J. Michael Nauman,Brady Corporation,"We fundamentally believe that our approach to capital allocation is a strong one for the long term. We take a look at, first and primarily, reinvestingin the business. And as you can see, we've been reinvesting in the business, and we will continue to do that, whether it's R&D, which -- although alarge portion does hit our bottom line, includes capital and strong capital. Whether it's in our facilities to making it more efficient, whether it's inpurchasing facilities that we believe are key to our long-term future, we are doing more and more of that as we are able, not from a cash perspective,but to make sure that we have the bandwidth and are making wise decisions. In addition, our dividend payouts remain strong, and we remainwilling to acquire stock as it makes sense for the company. As far as using cash in other ways such as acquisitions, although we absolutely have astrong analysis of this, we are patient. We need to make sure that we're not buying businesses that don't add significantly to the company. I'vealways said that we will keep our commitments. One of the commitments that I stated unequivocally about is if we acquire, we will acquire forsynergistic, technological reasons. In other words, a company must have a technology that we cannot develop in a timely and cost-effective way.We must help that company when we acquire them and they must help us. So we are patient and that does not mean that we don't think that we'lldeploy the capital, we do feel strongly we will. Timing is not one that we will stake because we believe that, that's actually negative to our shareholders'best interest.",True,False

It's been a few years now since you've been working on improving the productivity of the company,efficiencies, trying to get SG&A as a percent of sales down. Just wondering, looking back to what you've done and looking at the company today,how much room do you think that there's improvement? I mean, SG&A still in a fairly high as a percent of sales, so just wondering, looking 1 yearor 2 ahead, in terms of productivity and sort of just the overall cost structure of the company, how much more improvement do you think there'spossible?",True,False
885,64388528,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q2 2018 Brady Corp Earnings Call,J. Michael Nauman,Brady Corporation,"Well, I'd like to say, intrinsically, we do have a business that does require more SG&A, and that we are small volume, high mix, proprietary niches.That said, I feel strongly that we have excellent opportunities to continue to improve our SG&A structure. One of the mantras I've always used islower the water, you'll see the rocks. And really, the entire corporation has bought into that as they see more opportunities. I'll just -- I'll give youa great example that isn't directly related to SG&A, but it is a very visual. I went to one of our major facilities and challenge them with an audaciousamount of space that they would have to open up. And the head of the operations literally said 6 months later that he thought I was insane.     However, 6 months later, he'd already been able to open up half that amount of space so as well to 3 quarters and admitted he could do 3 quarters.And then when I challenged him, he said yes, he actually had plans to do all that space. If we literally just take a look at what we see today, ourpeople often aren't seeing all of the opportunities, but if we continue to improve, we're seeing more and more opportunities. There are a lot ofthings that we're working on today. I know our organization never even thought it was possible just a year-plus ago. So I'm very confident we cancontinue to do it. I have line of sight. Our team leaders have line of sight. Our managers have line of sight on specific actions we're taking to continuethe path.

From a gross margin percentage perspective, it was very negligible. So we're still at the 49.9%.And if you start -- if you break it down further and you look at it by each of the 2 divisions, ID Solutions as a percentage, it was relatively negligibleas well.

890,64388528,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q2 2018 Brady Corp Earnings Call,J. Michael Nauman,Brady Corporation,"Well, we can -- we need to bifurcate that between the 2 areas that we're seeing the biggest challenge, Charley. One is WPS Americas and the otheris our health care portion of IDS. And the drivers for those are different. In WPS Americas, you're effectively looking at a less opaque pricing structurein the marketplace. And so that does create more challenges. That said, by driving more proprietary products, by really providing complete solutions,we're giving our customers things that other companies really aren't and can't do. That result means we can overcome that. But obviously, on theone-off in the more commoditized space, that pricing pressure is stronger. Now let's flip over to IDS and the health care space, what you're lookingup there is a consolidation of buying groups. you're looking at consolidation of health care providers. Whenever you see that, the leverage thatthey can maintain over pricing is higher than before. And as a result of that, with our less proprietary products, we, once again, are facing more ofa challenge. In this case, once again, by creating unique proprietary products that we're pretty excited about, that actually not only add value butoften create a price point that's exciting for the hospital in addition, and yet give us greater total revenue at better margins. It's a win-win for bothour customer base, the buying groups and Brady overall.

We see, in the longer term, being able toget another 20% out of that. We, obviously, do want to maintain a healthy portfolio of products that we don't necessarily have expertise to developand manufacture to provide complete solutions, but we are uniquely positioned in our space to really provide most of the solutions ourself. It hasbeen fascinating as we've been really working on both new products and looking at the products we make at the ability of the group to seedifferently how they should be positioned and how that -- what they should manufacture and what they shown.

One in our commodity products, in many cases, we've eliminated some that just don't make sense in ourportfolio, actually, to the extent, over the last couple of years, of tens of millions of dollars in revenue. So what you're seeing as results are net ofus eliminating a lot of products that absolutely didn't make any sense. So to that point, without question, we're seeing less headwinds. If there wasa product that was commoditized that we really shouldn't have been selling, we aren't selling it anymore. And therefore, we're not literally tryingto roll upstream. But in general, because we are moving more to customize in proprietary, we're able to include those products as total packagesets. And the end result of that total package set is less -- a less pressure on pricing. But the final issue is, I do think we're seeing more stabilizationin the base value of those commodity products as well. But we don't expect to see that go away entirely.",True,False

For today's call, I'll share my thoughts on LendingTree's fourth quarter, providerelevant updates on the business and discuss the progress we've made against our strategic initiatives, before turning it over to J.D. who will thentake you through the financials and our guidance. Before we jump into the numbers, let me first provide a quick disclaimer on forward-looking statements. During today's call, we may discussLendingTree's plans, expectations, outlooks or forecast for future performance. Forward-looking statements are typically preceded by words suchas we expect, we believe, we anticipate or other similar statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, andLendingTree's actual results could differ materially from the views expressed today. Many, but not all, of the risks we face are described in LendingTree'speriodic reports filed with the SEC. On this call, we will discuss a number of non-GAAP measures, and I refer you to today's press release available on our website atinvestors.lendingtree.com for the comparable GAAP measure, definitions and full reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP. Now let's dive right in. LendingTree's fourth quarter capped off a truly transformative year. In addition to growing full year revenue and adjustedEBITDA by 61% and 65%, respectively, we more than tripled the size of our credit card business, strengthened our position in existing categorieslike small business and personal loans, and made our first foray into the asset side of the consumer's balance sheet with the acquisition ofDepositAccounts.com last June. In addition to exceptional financial performance, we made significant progress against our strategic initiatives,positioning us well for continued success in 2018 and beyond.     With the solid groundwork we've laid in 2017, suffice it to say that we are on track for a successful year ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to J.D. towalk you through the numbers.",False,True
914,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,J. D. Moriarty,"LendingTree, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the phone. Thank you all for joining us today. With Doug having already provided relevantupdates on the business, I'd like to briefly cover the recent quarter's performance, but also spend some time discussing a few important and likelyunderappreciated items that impact our results in the quarter and moving forward. There are a lot of moving pieces related to tax reform, equitycompensation and our convertible debt that I want to make sure are well-understood. Let's start with the quarter, and we'll get to those pieces ina moment. In the fourth quarter, the company managed through a seasonally challenging quarter to deliver revenue and EBITDA growth ahead of expectations.In the quarter, consolidated revenue of $161 million represents year-over-year growth of 60% and exceeds the high end of our prior guidance. Wealways take a conservative approach with regard to our fourth quarter to account for the fact that seasonality has an impact on our business. And while we certainly felt some of the expected seasonal headwinds, we're thrilled to be able to report better-than-expected results. It's alsoworth reminding you that the CompareCards acquisition was completed in November of 2016. So our fourth quarter 2016 comparable includesapproximately 6 weeks of CompareCards impact. At the product level, our mortgage business generated $67.7 million of revenue in the quarter, up 22% compared to the prior year. While downsequentially in the fourth quarter, the trends in that business have picked up in Q1, as we would generally expect. Non-mortgage revenue in the quarter remained strong at $93.3 million, growing 105% year-over-year and 58% pro forma for the acquisitions.We're very happy with the acquisitions we made in 2017. They're trending nicely, with both small business and deposits performing well in thequarter, and MagnifyMoney is complementing a number of our LendingTree businesses. Non-mortgage now represents 58% of total LendingTreerevenue. Variable marketing margin came in at $56.1 million or 35% of revenue. We expanded margins modestly, and we reduced marketing spend in certainchannels to optimize profitability. Again, this highlights the flexibility in our model. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter grew 56% year-over-year to$29.6 million and also substantially exceeded the high end of our prior guidance. As discussed in the third quarter call, we continued to hire aggressively in the fourth quarter to support sustained growth and scale. In the quarter,we added 52 full-time positions, ending the year at 535 total employees. While it's critical that we continue to invest in our people, I'd like to pointout that we're still very lean relative to the scale of our business. Turning now to the GAAP results. There are a few things to discuss that impacted our results in the fourth quarter and some other items that willimpact our results as we move forward, and I'd like to take time to address them. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a net loss from continuing operations of $6.5 million or $0.54 per share. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, werecorded a one-time charge of $9.1 million reflected in tax expense and representing a reduction in the value of our deferred tax assets. Also inconjunction with tax reform, we elected to donate $10 million towards the establishment of a charitable foundation. This is a community effortwe've been contemplating for a few years, and we felt the time was right to fund this charitable endeavor. This expense is recorded in G&A in thefourth quarter. Both of these charges are fully reflected in our GAAP results and considered one-time in nature. Excluding the impact of these and other extraordinary charges, our adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.84, which is up 9% comparedto the prior year. The primary drivers of the discrepancy between the growth profile of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS are increased amortizationof intangibles related to recent acquisitions and the increased interest expense largely related to the accretion of the debt discount associatedwith a convertible debt offering.     I realize that's a lot of information. But as I think you know from our Investor Days, we're committed to being very transparent and communicative.I'd like to refocus on the fundamentals of the business. As Doug mentioned at the outset, 2017 was a transformative year for LendingTree. We saw the benefits of both organic growth and acquisitions.We bolstered our balance sheet, became the scaled diversified player in our sector and, most importantly, for investors, delivered third year ofgrowth in excess of 50% in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We're seeing great trends in our business, and we are thrilled with the momentumthat we're carrying into 2018. With that, let's open the call to questions.",False,True
915,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,Operator,NA!,(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.,True,False
916,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,"RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, please. On this mortgage digitalization journey, Doug, could you talk about how long you think that will take? Is that a multiyearjourney, a couple of quarters? Just how long does it take to get through -- to get material traction in that? And then just very briefly, the total loanrequest, did you disclose what that was or what the year-over-year growth was?",True,False
917,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,Douglas R. Lebda,"LendingTree, Inc.","Let me take the first part of that, and J.D. can tell you what we can tell you on the total loan request number. The mortgage digitization journeyreally breaks down into 2 components. It breaks down first into the consumer experience we've talked about, where we -- where LendingTreeeffectively takes over the initial contact with the customer. We only transmit the customer's information to a lender once they're selected, and wetalked about that. I think that's going to be a couple more quarters before we get the revenue from that experience equal to, call it, the legacybusiness model of the company. But it's moving entirely in the right direction, and I'm actually thrilled and surprised with where it is. The secondpiece of it is once a consumer actually selects a lender and they're working with them, the digital mortgage experience is effectively automatingthe processing of loans through the lender system. If you look at companies like Rocket Mortgage and some of the technology that the Velocifysand Ellie Maes and Roostifys and many others have put out, effectively, what this does, it enables the consumer to upload their documents andget automated underwriting upload credit reports, property values, et cetera, without having to fill out lots of paperwork and fax a lot of documents.I think that is probably a this-year event. Lenders are recognizing the increased efficiency gains. Quite frankly, it's many ways becoming table stakesfor mortgage companies. You -- if you're the mortgage company that's sitting there saying, okay, fax me in all your documents, while somebodyelse is saying, click here in one button and everything is uploaded, you're at a continuing disadvantage. More broadly, we benefit from any digitizationof any part of the mortgage process, and these lenders just continue to make gains. And it's happening by the third-party tech companies. But it'sa long answer to saying I believe it's a this-year event.",True,False
918,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,J. D. Moriarty,"LendingTree, Inc.","Mark, the second part of your question was total loan request. And we did not disclose it partially -- well, largely because as our models becomemore diverse, and we've got different revenue models and different products like credit card, it becomes a less relevant metric. What I will tell youabout mortgage, however, is obviously, as Doug mentioned, we've moved -- we started moving in the fourth quarter, and we obviously know thatwe're moving here in the first quarter towards a more purchase environment. So clearly, total loan request in mortgage will be down, but that'sindicative of the environment not specific to LendingTree. And as mortgage is a smaller part of the overall business, it becomes less relevant.",True,False
919,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,Douglas R. Lebda,"LendingTree, Inc.","And the only other thing I'd add is in the mortgage business, which is cyclical, what you see -- now, we have grown through the cyclicality byincreasing bid -- in bids and the level of volume the lenders want. In a more purchase environment, that's the time when mortgage lenders reallyinvest in new technologies to make themselves more streamlined and really to reduce their cost. They need to do it. They need to improve theirCRM capabilities. In a refinance environment, they're just trying to close as much business as they can. Now is the time when they actually invest.And so the cyclicality of the underlying business actually really benefits our business here because this is when the lenders actually improve theirprocesses.",True,False

921,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,Jed Kelly,"Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Two. Has anything you've seen since your Analyst Day regarding higher interest rates or some recent softness in housing sales caused you to changeyour outlooks for mortgages growing in the mid-teens for 2018? And then we've seen an uptick in the higher non-advertising operating expenses.Other than the payroll expenses you called out, how much of the additional operating expenses in 2018 would you classify as one-time in nature?",True,False
922,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,Douglas R. Lebda,"LendingTree, Inc.","I'll let, again, let J.D. take the second part of that, and I'll take the first part. I think over the past many years, particularly since we changed our pricingand bidding model and our -- and the way we do our marketing in 2008 following the financial crisis, we've grown through the ups and downs ofmortgage. And the same trend continues. So as rates go up, you typically see refinance originations decline clearly, and purchase continues to doits thing based on the underlying housing market. Lenders flip over to wanting purchase customers. They still want refinance customers, there'sjust fewer of them. And we're able to then help the lenders switch over that business. They increase the bid value for LendingTree lead, and theywant more of it because they need more in their other -- they need more because their organic business is not there. So long story short, risinginterest rates I won't say helps us. It certainly doesn't hurt us. It definitely makes our lenders pay attention to improving technology and improvingprocesses, which improves conversion rates. And I look forward to the day when rising rates hurts our business because that will mean that we'reat about 50% share instead of 2%.",True,False
923,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,J. D. Moriarty,"LendingTree, Inc.","Yes. So Jed, I guess, as Doug says, when we gave our guide for the full year in mid-December, we obviously are contemplating the rate environment.And so that guidance -- it's a very nice position we're in as obviously, mortgage doesn't need to grow to breaking that pace for us to deliverexceptional growth as a business. And so, no, there's absolutely no change to that forecast at this point. With respect to your expense question,obviously, the one that we're watching, just as any company that's grown headcount the way we have, is payroll, as you point out. And that's justthe scaling function. And I would point out that on a revenue per FTE basis, we were obviously incredibly efficient and continue to be so. And sowe're very lean relative. In terms of other expenses that you'd identify as one-time, I think they're just scaling things. We can work through withthe offline and go through each of the line items, but there's nothing that jumps out at me as a big one-time item.",True,False

925,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,John Robert Campbell,"Stephens Inc., Research Division","Doug, just back to the digital fulfillment pilot. Anything you can share, just maybe broadly or anecdotally, about the conversion uplift from thedigital channel versus the traditional offline channel?",True,False
926,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,Douglas R. Lebda,"LendingTree, Inc.","It's -- I would say it's significantly higher from the lender's perspective. However, it's really an apple and orange. So if you -- if once you -- insteadof sending a customer intro to a lender at the time they fill out the form, as LendingTree is doing that incubation and we're only sending it afterthey select a lender, it's further down in the funnel. So we're seeing multiples of the locker rates that you would see if we just send them to yousort of raw, however, they're deeper down in the funnel. What I can share is that I think in December, we were saying that we were roughly, I think,1/3 to 1/2 of the monetization versus our existing mortgage experience. The monetization has now moved up north of 50% and it's climbing, andwe still have a lot of product improvements to go. So that -- and the lenders, by the way, and you saw some of this at Investor Day, they are wildlypleased with the performance of that, and we've got a lot of interest from new lenders. We expect -- we've got a major industry conference comingup in a few weeks, and we expect this to be a major focus of that conference as we meet with all of our lenders. And we also expect to see them,as we sit down with all of our analytics meetings, asking for significantly more volume.",True,False
927,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,John Robert Campbell,"Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then it sounds like as far as this kind of really taking hold across the board, it's a bit of a waiting game. Obviously, lenders -- youhave more lenders in that upfront technology. But then also, you mentioned waiting to see at least a kind of in-line payout to the traditional channel.But if conversion is kind of ""materially higher,"" when do you expect those payouts eventually move well above the traditional channel where youkind of balance out the lender ROI?",True,False
928,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,Douglas R. Lebda,"LendingTree, Inc.","Yes. I would -- if you think about the inefficiency of the -- first off, the current system works the way it does because that's the way it had to workwithout the advent of real-time pricing technology, real-time processing technology and fantastic CRM systems. I absolutely believe that as thatnew experience, internally we call that Rulo, you might have heard us use that term before, we expect that over time, that significantly increasesnot only the payouts, there's a couple more impacts as well, too. First, you match a lot -- you get offers for a lot more borrowers because you cansort of skip the filtering step inside of LendingTree and go directly to the pricing engines. So you see a material increase in customer satisfactionfrom that. Obviously, you're reducing phone calls. You're also increasing capacity with your lenders massively. So if you go from a situation wherea customer is getting called and -- not just get called, but sold by 5 different lenders, and you go from that situation to a lender only gets a customeronce they've been selected, you now basically increase the capacity on the network more than 5x. And that opens up a lot more volume thatlenders can actually demand.",True,False

930,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,Youssef Houssaini Squali,"SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions, if I may. Could you speak to the margin trends within the mortgage business? I'm particularly interested in the purchaseversus refi. There seems to be natural de-aggregation or should be natural de-aggregation in the margin as we get more refis -- I'm sorry, less refisand more purchases. So if you can just speak to that trend. And then on the buybacks, so how should we be thinking about that new authorization?Is it primarily to be offsetting the dilution? Or are you just having that being enacted to be opportunistic? Maybe just help us think through that.",True,False
931,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,J. D. Moriarty,"LendingTree, Inc.","Sure, sure. Let me start -- I'll start with the buyback question because it's literally just an authorization. As we pointed out, we bought stock backover the last 6 months, over $30 million worth of stock over the last 6 months. And we are deploying a certain amount of our free cash to buy backshares knowing that we have pending dilution. So it's just a capital allocation philosophy in the authorization itself, and that's obviously been agood bet. The authorization itself is just that and consistent with previous authorization. So there's nothing to read into the amount of theauthorization. I would read into the consistency with which we're making a bet on our stock and also trying to manage our capital allocation. Withrespect to your question on mortgage, obviously, we've acknowledged that we are currently in a purchase environment. And the majority of ourmortgage business has always been in refi, and refi monetizes better just because of the (inaudible) of the transaction there. And what happenswhen we move to a purchase environment, where we referenced that we tend to garner market share, is because we demonstrate our value tolenders who are going after an increasingly -- a smaller pool of refi. Okay? And so we saw that certainly in the fourth quarter. I think we're seeingthat here in the first quarter. We don't break out individual margin profiles by business. But the nice part about the diversification that we'veexperienced over the last years, that's a less of an issue for us. And certainly, as we projected our budget for 2018, that was all considered in ourguidance prior. So we go through, obviously, industry data and projections for levels of mortgage activity and origination activity when we puttogether our budget. And so we don't see any diversion from that at this point.",True,False
932,64388239,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 LendingTree Inc Earnings Call,Douglas R. Lebda,"LendingTree, Inc.","And the only -- just to add on to that a little bit. In terms of at the VMM level margin trends, I would never be looking at VMM percentages. I wouldalways be looking at VMM dollars. What you would typically, for -- and a declining percentage margin is, in some ways, actually very good whenyou see it. What that means is that lender demand for new customers is higher than what is coming in right now. So therefore, we step on themarketing gas and market into that. To get each new additional customer obviously cost you additional money to get it because we're increasingbids and increasing spend across all of our marketing channels. I've said before, too, some ways you can see the health of the business by howmuch we're running on TV as well at times. And that's not -- I wouldn't take that one to the banks necessarily because we're always testing anddoing different things. But when you see us generally doing more marketing, it means that we're trying to drive more volume to our lenders. Onthe buyback philosophy, our philosophy is always this, we take -- J.D. and our finance team works with a couple of our board members. We put up-- we put a grid together every quarter so we can both buy back a certain percentage of our cash flow as well as have something in place shouldthings be opportunistically available, which it would, and that's worked very well in the past.

Do you plan to use television as extensively as you have? And will that change how much you spend on marketing? And then maybe acorollary to that is, as you go through this digitalization process, wouldn't that inherently boost some margin because of the, just less friction pointsand things like that, is that the way to understand that? And then the final question is just on personal loans, saw a really nice growth in Q4. Wasthere anything that changed in the industry or things that you did to drive that growth?

I would say, with some of the acquisitions we've made, we havemade significant progress in, I don't even want to call it SEO, I would call it putting fantastic great content out on the Web and syndicating it in     areas and on our site that Google and other websites love and they love to link to it, so we actually are increasing our capability there. Obviously,that stuff comes for free. And we avoid any of the black hat tricks and make sure that, as I said, we're delivering great content. The other changeyou could expect to see is that we will be broadening our advertising and you'll see us, not only potentially advertise the CompareCards brandbrought to you by LendingTree across all of our channels, but you'll also see us increasing the breadth of the product advertising that we're doing.As the monetization in these non-mortgage products improves, we have more and more leeway to go out and drive volume.

Kerry, as you asked about personal loans, it's actually highly related to your overall marketing question, right -- or the answer is, I should say.The marketing messaging in personal loans has been shifted to be much more about the consumer need as opposed to the product. And that'sbeen really effective for us. I think it's just -- it's a very good product for us as well and one where we feel like we have exceptional market share.But marketing has clearly enhanced personal loans. And for that business to have hit scale in Q3 and maintain that scale in a seasonally challengingQ4 is exceptional. And so -- and we've seen that trend kind of continue here in Q1. So we're really excited about that business, and I'm glad youbrought it up. That's really the main driver. And then the only other thing I'd emphasize is we're going through, from a marketing perspective, alot of segmentation exercises. And to your point, we can become much more personalized. And we are also testing at a much higher velocity thanwe were a year ago. And so as the business gets bigger, we start to benefit from scale.

That happens, not just switching between refinance and purchase, but it also means you addin more states, you increase your caps, which is your overall level of volume.

So every day, we're seeing increases and decreases in demand. And demandis price, it's quantity and it's coverage. Those are the 3 functions of the demand equation. And we see those things change instantaneously, andthey change exactly in tandem with the corresponding marketing cost for us to go generate that volume. So as the lenders are instantaneouslychanging because they're reacting to their own pipelines and what they're seeing in their own shop, that is being instantaneously seen on themarketing side.

Really, to seethis thing scale and obviously, the closest competitor here is Bankrate, and I would put this similar to credit cards, which is we bought a -- one ofthe insurgents in the credit card business, but had very good payouts. And with the combination of great work from their team, which is now we'reall one team, great work from the LendingTree sales team, great work from the BD team, we were able to not only increase demand that thoselenders want from us, make sure the payouts stay up, but then we can go and turn on the marketing gas. The same thing is going to happen indeposits for the smaller player compared to the insurgents here. We know from our lending partners, we have a very good product. They like thequality of what we're sending them, and they want more of it. And so we just now need to deliver more of it.

We obviously know internally what is new and what is existingcustomers. It's not something that we disclose because any -- except for the My LendingTree stuff. So I mean, if you just look at it from there, bydefinition, any revenue from My LendingTree means that's coming from an already existing customer. Now some of those people -- because mostof those people are coming through the other loan types. So you've got at least 10%. I believe in the past, we've said about 20% of all of our revenueis ""organic."" But we'll get you -- we can potentially try and get you some more specific numbers there. But really, the business gets modeled out atthe core physics in what we call the flywheel level, where you're looking at what is my expected revenue for every customer who's visiting our site,what's the demand across all the products, then you go try to optimize your marketing spend against that, and any revenue from existing customers.The nice thing about that is it's typically coming with no marketing cost. However, here's what makes it somewhat more complicated, which iswhy we model it differently. Think of an existing customer who wakes up one morning and sees a TV ad and decided it's time to go refinance theirmortgage, and they go to Google.com and they type in LendingTree, and then they click on a LendingTree ad. Is that an existing customer? Or dowe just pay to get that customer to come back again? It's actually both. So we think the VMM way is a better way to look at it.

Hey, if somebodystops bidding on the keyword mortgage rates, does that take down your overall revenue? The answer is no because there's hundreds of othercompanies in there that are bidding on the term mortgage rates and every other keyword under the sun. The same thing is true with LendingTree.We've got hundreds of lenders. And the liquidity of any marketplace business, the more lenders you have in there, the more variation you have inhow they do underwriting, in how they do marketing, in how they see the world, the better off it is for us. So we see -- for example, in personalloans, once you've got 40 or 50 lenders, you start to see pricing change, so we have a 500 basis points spread for the consumer between the lowprice and the high price. You have verifiable savings, and that happens because you've got all these lenders. So when 1 or 2 lenders has a problem,which by the way, they always do.

So first off, if you've got more revenue coming from My LendingTree, that additional revenue per customer,it's factored back into the bogey, if you will, that we give to marketing. So for example, let's just say we're adding an additional $3 for every leadthat we generate because a certain percentage of those people sign up for My LendingTree. We then say, hey, our revenue for this lead type fromthat channel is $3 higher. Finance has that in the systems. And then, therefore, that is immediately transmitted to the marketing team to go driveVMM dollars. So any increase in revenue per customer, whether it comes from cross-sell, higher conversion rates, better pricing, better coverageor My LendingTree revenue goes immediately back into marketing. The second thing -- and all of our marketing, by the way, is profitable. So evenwhen we do ""brand advertising,"" we're pretty tight on this that we make sure that we're making money with the dollars that we spend now. Offlinehas a bit of a couple months lag to it, but it still makes us money. The exciting thing that I would say, we're getting closer to the time where we willbe able to advertise My LendingTree/come to LendingTree, get a free credit score and get alerts to save you money throughout your entire life.We will be able to do independent marketing of that product as the expected values continue to improve. And I think we're getting closer andcloser to that day right now. When that happens, that could really open the flood gates to growth, but we need to make sure that the expectedvalue to revenue is there so that we can advertise that. Last thing I'd say on that front, because we've got this big -- this always great productdiversification, that also adds to our marketing. So when we go -- if you look at the competitors in that space, let's take a Credit Karma, who doesnot have the level of product breadth that we do for monetization, doesn't have the depth of lender coverage, their monetization is going to belower, we would expect that just like our monetization and mortgage is higher and we can go win business development deals against ourcompetitors, we would expect that our monetization in My LendingTree will be higher than our competitor's products, and therefore, we'll be ableto more profitably spend on marketing.",True,False

I'm very pleased to announce today that Sangamo and Kite, a Gilead company, have enteredinto a collaboration to develop gene-edited cell therapy products for oncology. Next-generation autologous and allogeneic CAR T and T-cell receptor therapies require precise, efficient and specific genome editing. Kite isinvesting heavily to win in this emerging field, and we're thrilled to be their chosen partner supplying gene-editing technology for the developmentsof new CAR-T and T-cell receptor treatments for patients with cancer. In a few moments, Curt will provide more details of this agreement and what it will mean for the evolution of Sangamo's business strategy. Butfirst, I want to reflect on how the development of the technology has enabled this collaboration. Our zinc finger engineering capabilities have advanced rapidly in the last few years with improved zinc finger nuclease architectures. Novelenhancements have resulted in a 300-fold increase in potential design options for a given genetic sequence, yielding higher, on-target modificationactivity with ex vivo editing efficiencies now reaching as high as 99.5%, an off-target cleavage consistently below the level of detection. We have also made great strides towards industrializing production of ZFNs, which helps expedite our research and meets the needs of partners.The adjacencies of computing and sequencing technology enable rapid screening and the development of lead candidates. It takes us 10 days, 8,if we work through the weekend, to produce a 96-well plate of options that can be further tuned to increase efficiency and remove nonspecificbinding contacts to reduce off-target cleavage to undetectable levels. We are combining these advancements in our technology with our experiencespanning 2 decades in preclinical and clinical research in this field. To my delight, soon after joining Sangamo nearly 20 months ago, I learned that the science here is even better than I expected. It has remarkabletechnology. And it's second standard for what therapeutic genome editing should be, precise, efficient, specific. We are delighted that when Kitecame looking for an editing partner, they chose Sangamo and that they chose zinc fingers. And we are equally pleased to our search for an optimalcollaborator in oncology has brought us to Kite because we sought a partner with the financial strength and clear determination to win. No othercompany is investing as heavily to bring the new products forward. This collaboration fits very nicely with our strategy to partner technology forapplications that require special expertise or resources. Oncology is an incredibly competitive therapeutic area, and genome editing is just one of the several important inputs into these new cellulartherapies. We believe the dedication of Kite to this space greatly increases the probability of success for the development, commercialization ofzinc finger nucleases across a range of products in oncology. This announcement builds on the momentum of last year, in which we made significant progress, transitioning Sangamo from its previous researchfocus to a sustainable, fully-integrated company that aims to translate cutting-edge science into genomic medicines to transform patients' lives. With new management, a clear strategy, the validation of multiple external collaborations, a strengthened balance sheet and with core values thatmake our patients a central focus of everything we do, Sangamo is now operating with an urgency and efficiency to pursue the vast opportunitiespresented by our technology platform. 2017 was foundational. 2018 promises to be transformative. We now have 5 active clinical programs across our gene therapy, genome editing andcell therapy platforms, and expect to see progress in patient enrollment across all our studies, and most importantly, efficacy data begin to readout throughout the year. We recently provided a safety data updates from our MPS II clinical study at the 2018 World Symposium Congress andexpect preliminary efficacy data readouts from our MPS and hemophilia A clinical trials towards the first half of this year.     Furthermore, we've recently strengthened our leadership team with the appointment of Heather Turner as our Senior Vice President, In-houseGeneral Counsel; and Dr. Duncan McKay, our new Vice President and General Manager of Sangamo Europe, who will base in the U.K. I'm pleasedto welcome both Heather and Duncan to Sangamo. Heather has deep biotech experience, having worked at Cooley, and also as an in-house general counsel for the last 15 years. She will help ustremendously, as we advance to the late-stage development and on to commercialization. And as we establish our footprint in Europe and plan the strategic expansion of clinical development and other operations abroad, Duncan's roleis critical to execution of our 2018 goals. He's already begun planning for our clinical operations in the U.K., and we're working closely with Ed onEuropean clinical trial initiation for MPS and hemophilia B. I've known Duncan for more than 20 years and worked with him closely during muchof that time. He knows the industry well and is someone who just gets things done. I'll now turn the call over to Curt, who will discuss in greater detail our newly announced oncology collaboration with Kite and provide an overviewof our evolving business strategy for 2018.

We are excited to announce that we will work with Kite, a Gilead company, on the development ofnew gene-edited cell therapies for cancer. Gene editing is a critical component in the development of next-generation autologous and allogeneiccell therapies. Sangamo has more than a decade of experience, developing cell therapy products and translating this cutting-edge research intoclinical trials. As Sandy pointed out, in recent years, our technology has advanced very rapidly along the 3 critical dimensions of precision, efficiency and specificity.We are now able to rapidly assemble ZFNs to precisely target any nucleoside in the genome. We have increased our ex vivo on-target efficiencyto consistently above 90%. We have learned to engineer away nonspecific binding between the ZFN and the DNA, reducing off-target cleavageto below undetectable levels. This unique profile is being recognized by partners as setting the standard for what good looks like in terms oftherapeutic genome editing. It enabled the recent gene regulation collaboration with Pfizer for C9ORF-linked ALS and frontotemporal lobardegeneration, and it was certainly recognized by Kite in the optimal way to gene edit cell therapies for cancer. After careful consideration, we determined that building an oncology business requires specialized and dedicated expertise and that patients willbe best served by Sangamo lining ourselves with a leading partner in the oncology field with the resources, relationships and capabilities to advancenew therapies rapidly into global development and commercialization. With the Kite collaboration, we believe we are working with the company most committed to transforming the space of new cell therapies andoncology. And we think this collaboration will optimally benefit both patients living with cancer and the use of Sangamo technology within thisfield. We are also excited that Kite, after publicly stating their interest in partnering with the gene-editing company, made the active choice of zincfingers and Sangamo for the next generation of cell therapy and oncology. We are pleased with the scope in the strong financial terms. Kite is paying Sangamo $150 million upfront to gain an exclusive license for the useof ZFNs for gene editing of T-cells and NK, or natural killer cells to create CAR-T, TCR and NKR products in oncology. We are eligible to receive over$3 billion in milestone payments, that is $300 million per product in development, regulatory, first commercial sale and commercial sales milestonepayments for 10 or more products. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of future products resulting from the collaboration. All Sangamo internal FTE and external passthrough expenses under the oncology research plan will be reimbursed by Kite. Sangamo will beprimarily responsible for developing and optimizing the cell therapy genome editing process, including delivering ZFNs to knock out specific targetgenes and AAVs to deliver CARs, TCRs and NKRs for autologous and allogeneic T-cell and NK cell products. Sangamo has significant know-how from its prior experience in building genome-edited cell therapies and will be leveraging this expertise withthe goal of helping Kite build best-in-class products for patients living with liquid and solid tumor cancers.     We end the year with $244.6 million, and since then, have received $12 million of funds from Pfizer. Once the Kite collaboration receives HSRclearance, we will receive an additional $150 million. We expect our cash resources will last into the second half of 2020. We will provide additionalcolor and updated financial guidance in the next earnings call, as we incorporate the impact of the oncology deal. Our balance sheet is very strong as we enter this exciting next phase of Sangamo's growth. We have significant potential, corporate and clinicalcatalysts this year and next, including expected proof-of-concept data from 7 genome editing, gene therapy and cell therapy clinical trials. Overthe next few years, we will continue to advance new programs toward IND. While we plan to retain some programs to take forward ourselves, ourstrategy will also continue to include partnerships for certain programs, which may provide additional potentially significant sources of upfrontcash and milestone payments in the future. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ed for clinical update.",False,True
970,64389261,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Sangamo Therapeutics Inc Earnings Call,Edward R. Conner,"Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.","Thank you, Kathy, and good morning to everyone on the call. We expect 2018 to be a very exciting year for Sangamo's clinical team, with datareadouts from our lead programs expected throughout the year. We now have 5 clinical programs, and I'd like to begin by reviewing recent progressfrom our 3 clinical-stage, in vivo, genome-editing programs in MPS I, MPS II and hemophilia B, starting with the CHAMPIONS MPS II clinical studyfor SB-913. This is a dose-ascending study, enrolling up to 9 adults with attenuated MPS II into 3 dose cohorts. As a quick reminder, our gene-editing programsuse our zinc finger nuclease technology to target a precise position in the DNA just downstream of the albumin promoter in liver cells to create aspace to allow for insertion of new DNA as shown on Slide 17. In the case of MPS II, this new DNA codes for IDS, the enzyme deficient in MPS II patients. The goal then is to have liver cells produce a steady andconsistent level of enzyme, which circulates throughout the body, enters into cells and performs its normal functions for the lifetime of the patient. Turning to Slide 18. As Sandy mentioned, we presented preliminary safety data on the first subject in the CHAMPIONS study at the World Symposiumin San Diego in early February. As of December 27, the subject has shown no drug-related severe adverse events and their liver function testsremained within the normal range. To date, 2 subjects have been treated in the first dose cohort and the infusion of a dose of 5.00E+12 vg/kg ofSB-913 appears to be safe and well tolerated. We expect to dose the next patient early next month. For our MPS I program using SB-318 on Slide 19, we currently have 5 sites open and we have 2 patients in screening who have passed initial labassessments. Other patients are advancing through the screening process. I expect patient enrollment to advance steadily throughout 2018 andthat we will have initial data from this program this year. If you recall, on our third quarter call last November, we discussed our focus on enrollment of pediatric patients, the patient population where webelieve medical need is greatest for our therapies. We will include adolescents and children in the current Phase I/II studies once we have collectedappropriate safety data in adults. We will expand enrollments in these studies to Europe where EU authorities encouraged us to file a CTA forpediatric studies. Moving on to Slide 20. Our hemophilia B program (technical difficulty) continues to be a challenge to enroll. We are in the process of initiating 2 additional study sites in the U.S. as well as expanding enrollment toEurope. The CTA for this study was filed at the beginning of the year and we expect to activate sites in the U.K. and enroll patients by the end ofthe year. I look forward to working with Duncan, our new VP and General Manager of Sangamo Europe, to initiate the study arms in adolescentand pediatric patients in the U.K. and begin enrollment there across the MPS I, MPS II and hemophilia B programs.     Turning to Slide 22 to our hemophilia A clinical program, SB-525, being developed in collaboration with Pfizer. SB-525 is based on our AAV cDNAgene therapy approach to deliver a functional copy of the Factor VIII gene to the nucleus of liver cells. We currently have 8 sites open for the trialsand 3 patients dosed so far with another to be dosed shortly. We expect to release top line efficacy data from the SB-525 programs at the ScientificMeeting some time in mid-2018. Next, a quick update from our ST-400 Phase I/II clinical program for beta-thalassemia on Slide 24. Our ST-400 cell therapy candidate is a differentiatedapproach to treating beta-thalassemia, mimicking naturally-occurring genetic variance in the human body to boost fetal hemoglobin expression.The manufacturing of ST-400 involves ex vivo nonviral mRNA delivery of ZFNs, a potential strategic advantage of a randomly integratinglentiviral-based approaches currently being developed. The first site for the ST-400 study will be initiated soon. The study is designed to enroll a total of 6 patients, all to be treated with the same dose.We expect to enroll the first patient in the second quarter of this year. Subsequent patients can undergo apheresis while prior patients are enrolledand cell product is being manufactured. We do this to ensure the shortest possible enrollment time between patients. I would like to reiterate our strategy for rolling out clinical data from our ongoing clinical trials. Rather than release efficacy data on a per-patientbasis, our plan is to release data once it has matured with appropriate post-treatment follow-up time, so that we may disclose data we believe tobe both clinically meaningful and reliable. To close, I'm pleased with the progress our clinical team has made in 2017 and very excited about the prospects of accelerating our genome-editingstudies into the pediatric patient populations. We remain on track with our clinical milestones for 2018, and I look forward to preliminary datareadouts from our hemophilia A and MPS II studies in the next few months. I'll now turn the call over to Michael Holmes, our Head of Research. Mike?",False,True
971,64389261,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Sangamo Therapeutics Inc Earnings Call,Michael Holmes,"Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.","Thanks, Ed, and good morning. I want to take this opportunity to state how proud I am to see the hard work and achievements made by Sangamo'sR&D teams being recognized with important collaborations exemplified by today's Kite announcements as well as the C9ORF72 and hemophiliaA deals with Pfizer. I've been at Sangamo now 17 years, focused on the development of our zinc finger protein base, genome editing and gene regulation platformsfor the treatment of patients with significant unmet medical needs. Our technology has progressed over my tenure. In the last few years, it hasadvanced by leaps and bounds. I'm extremely proud of our team -- of our -- of how our team continues to lead this field and the strong validation that our work has received recentlyfrom external parties. And I just want to stop here and say it's truly incredible what we've accomplished, especially over the last 12 months, andthat these advancements are a result of the innovative and collaborative effort of our R&D teams. With that, I want to bring attention to a few of our scientists, who -- whose teams have contributed to these collaborations. Ed Rebar's team forthe enhanced architectures, which we have recently begun to sketch, which allow for the rapid generation of highly precise, efficient and specificzinc fingers. Gary Lee and his team for their exciting improvements in ZFN-mediated T-cell multiplex editing for next-generation CAR-T and TCRcell therapies. Bryan Zeitler's group for their recent work in gene regulation for CNS diseases that set the foundation for the C9ORF72 partnership.And Brigit Riley, for establishing a potentially best-in-class gene therapy approach for hemophilia A, which demonstrated the diversification ofSangamo's technical capabilities in the gene therapy and led to the first partnership with Pfizer last year. Turning to Slide 26. In the liver, where we've focused our in vivo genome editing and gene therapy approaches to treat rare diseases requiringprotein replacement. Our Fabry disease gene therapy program, ST-920, advances towards the clinic. We are currently completing the preclinicaldata package, including a study in nonhuman primates and remain on track to submit the IND application to the FDA later this year.     Turning to Slide 29. At the Keystone Symposia meeting on emerging cellular therapies earlier this month, Sangamo presented data demonstratinghighly efficient, multiplex gene editing in human T-cells with ZFNs. Multiplex editing is the ability to make multiple genetic changes in a singlestep and is critical for the development of next-generation cellular therapies to treat liquid and solid tumors in cancer. It enables simultaneousknockout of certain genes to prevent the body from rejecting the treatment and knocking the mutant genes to equip the modified T-cells withtargeted antitumor functions. Sangamo scientist, Sumiti Jain, presented recent work in which we performed 4 edits simultaneously, all at greater than 90% efficiency resultingin 76% of modified cells containing all 4 edits. In addition to preparing to work closely with our new partner to accelerate Kite's development ofnew cell therapies in oncology, Gary and his team are now exploring how to leverage our gene-edited cell therapy expertise into other therapeuticareas outside of oncology where we'll obtain full rights, including autoimmune diseases, a promising area where cell therapy research is justbeginning. Another key therapeutic area we are focused on involves combining our ZFP-TF gene regulation platform with novel AAVs engineered across theblood-brain barrier in order to deliver ZFP-TF broadly to CNS and regulate target gene expressions. Turning to Slide 31. We've initiated our C9ORF72 program for ALS with Pfizer. In this program, we used ZFP-TF to distinguish the mutant allele fromwild type and to selectively downregulate the expression of the mutant form of the gene. Also, on our gene regulation work, we've been exploringthe ability of ZFP-TFs to identify and downregulate expression of tau, an area that is increasingly receiving interest in the scientific, medical andpharmaceutical research community. This year, we are continuing our preclinical work in this program testing the safety and tolerability, and also the efficiency and specificity of ourZFP-TFs in novel AAVs and nonhuman primates. We've completed the initial pilot studies in monkeys and the treatment was well tolerated. Theresults of these in other follow-on nonhuman primate studies will read out later this year. In closing, I want to reiterate what a remarkable time this is for Sangamo research. The labs are buzzing with excitement and energy, as we see ourwork create value for the company and our collaborations and in programs entering the clinic. I'll now turn the call back over to Sandy.",False,True

1024,64389860,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call,Glenn Kelman,Redfin Corporation,"Thanks, Elena, and hi, everyone. Redfin's year-over-year market share gains continued to accelerate in the fourth quarter, and our revenues exceededthe range we gave you last November. More importantly, we invested in fundamental improvements to our customer service while reducing ourloss from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017. Our fourth quarter revenue was $95.8 million, an increase of 43% over the fourth quarter of 2016. A more fair comparison excludes new businessesto consider only the sales through our own agents and our partner agents. These revenues were up 36% over the fourth quarter of 2016. Excludingrevenue from new businesses is especially important because our new experimental service for buying homes outright from consumers, RedfinNow, counts the entire sale price of a home as revenue, even though our gain on the sale is only a tiny fraction of that price. Our first Redfin Nowsales closed in the second quarter of 2017. We still lost money for the quarter and the year. While this was by design, we have to soberly account in this call for what we're buying with thoselosses: technologies to make our brokerage better, faster and more efficient; new products to broaden our customer appeal; new businesses togive each customer more value. I've never worked so long in a business where there are still so many ways for it to grow. The most important measure of our performance is our customer satisfaction. In a November 2017 survey of nearly 2,000 Americans who workedwith an agent over the past year to buy or sell a home, Redfin's net promoter score was 52% higher than traditional agents. A net promoter scoreis a measure of customer satisfaction. This was the fifth consecutive survey in which Redfin's customer satisfaction was higher than our competitors. Our market share by home value was 0.71% in the fourth quarter, the same as in the third quarter, but a gain of 0.15 percentage points over thefourth quarter of 2016. Year-over-year share gains accelerated steadily throughout 2017 from 0.10 percentage points in the first quarter to 0.11 inthe second, 0.14 in the third and now 0.15 in the fourth quarter. We believe that share is the best measure of our competitive position because itexcludes the housing market's ups and downs. As we predicted in our last 2 earnings calls, traffic growth moderated in the fourth quarter, mostly because our audience has become so large inabsolute terms. But redfin.com continued to be the U.S.'s fastest-growing real estate website. Our year-over-year growth in online visitors was 33%in the fourth quarter compared to 38% in the third quarter. We expect strong traffic growth in 2018 but with percentage gains continuing tomoderate. Beyond 2018, we believe our traffic growth will come from the 77 markets that Redfin opened less than 10 years ago, from Googlesearches on real estate terms where we haven't been competitive before and, as Redfin becomes more well known for listing search, from morepeople bypassing Google to come directly to our site. We also expect that our business will depend less on our growth as a listing search site andmore on our growth as a brokerage, with gains in repeat customers continuing to accelerate and more people coming to Redfin for on-demandhome tours and lower fees. More advertising is also likely to contribute to our growth. As our conviction deepens that we offer the best service, we want America to knowabout it. In the fourth quarter, we prepared the most comprehensive marketing campaign in Redfin's history, with our first major radio and billboardads both promoting our 1% listing fee. To illustrate the power of on-demand home tours, we also developed a new TV ad that shows a coupleinstantly moving from one listing to another via magic doors activated by our mobile application. Starting February 5, these ads began to run inmore than a dozen U.S. cities. Beyond traditional media, we plan to continue drawing on our unique data about which online visitors actually buy or sell a home. This will let usmake better investments than we believe any broker can in online video, search engine ads, retargeting and other digital media. Finding advertising channels that we can profitably spend lots of money on continues to be a strategic priority for Redfin. Most of our potentialcustomers still don't know about us. In November 2017, we asked thousands of people buying or selling a home in long-established Redfin marketsto name their top 3 real estate websites. Less than 1 in 3 named redfin.com. When asked to name top 3 brokerage, less than 1 in 10 named Redfin,even in markets where we've run TV ads for 3 years. One of the only reasons we may defer improving profits every year is to spend more on ads.We spent 20% of 2017 gross profits on advertising placements, but if we find a winning formula, in 1 year, we might spend nearly double thatpercentage to get our name out there. Those ads aren't going to be immediately profitable, given that it typically takes 6 months to buy a home     In the fourth quarter, we sold nearly all the homes we'd already bought before, with the remainder under contract to sell by the end of this month.We also continued to get plenty of opportunities throughout last quarter to buy more. But at the same time, we experimented with payinghomeowners less for their homes in an effort to -- excuse me, in an effort to widen our profits on the subsequent sale. It didn't work. More homeownersrejected our offers, and we bought far fewer homes in the fourth quarter of 2017 than the 19 we reported in the third quarter. In January and February, we're now paying slightly more for Redfin Now homes and completing purchases at a brisk pace. But since we came intothe first quarter of 2018, with few homes to sell, we expect fewer sales. That said, it now seems likely that purchase activity will continue to accelerate.So by the second or third quarter of this year, we expect to allocate $20 million rather than $10 million for purchasing homes from consumers.Given our success so far at selling all the homes we've bought, we view this as an acceptable risk. We still haven't hired enough engineers and businesspeople to run Redfin Now at any scale except as an experiment, but we'll continue to run itas such, evaluating each quarter, whether Redfin Now can appeal to more than 10% of would-be home sellers at prices that compensate us for ourrisk. The other new business we wanted to update you about is Redfin Mortgage, which we launched in the first quarter of 2017, to issue loans to ourhomebuying customers. We believe integrating a lending operation with Redfin's existing brokerage and title businesses, all running off our ownsoftware, can ultimately lead to an entirely digital closing, where Redfin borrowers can compete almost like cash buyers. As with Redfin Now, we'reno longer disclosing exact transaction counts. But we were pleased to see loan volume increase during a season when purchase is slow. Fourthquarter loan volume in Texas grew by nearly 40% over the 13 loans we closed in the third quarter, in large part because Redfin Mortgage advisersworked harder to pre-approve loans faster and connect with our customers and our agents on nights and weekends, when deals usually cometogether. We also expanded to a second state, Illinois, where we closed a few loans. And near the end of the year, we expanded to Washington,D.C. And with that, I'll turn it over to Chris.",False,True
1025,64389860,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call,Chris Nielsen,Redfin Corporation,"Thanks, Glenn. We finished 2017 with solid fourth quarter results that were above our guidance range. Revenue was $96 million, including a $5million contribution from Redfin Now. Our revenue grew 43% year-over-year. Real estate revenue, which excludes Redfin Now, Mortgage and otherservices, was $89 million and grew 36% year-over-year. Brokerage revenue, or revenue from home sales closed by our agents, was up 37%, drivenby a 34% growth in brokerage transactions. Revenue per brokerage transaction grew 2% year-over-year. We reduced our sell-side commissions to1% in 18 additional markets the beginning of the fourth quarter. To offset this reduction in brokerage revenue, we reduced refunds to homebuyers,doing so slightly ahead of the continued mix shift to our faster-growing listings business. Revenue from our partner agents grew 24%, driven by20% growth in partner transactions and a 3% increase in revenue per partner transaction. Other segment revenue of $7.1 million was up from $1.6million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This revenue includes Redfin Now sales as well as revenue from title services, mortgage originations and otherproducts. We had no revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 from Redfin Now or mortgage originations. These businesses are new. Gross profit was $29 million, up 37% year-over-year, including a very small contribution to gross profit from Redfin Now. Gross margin on thecombined partner and brokerage business, known as our real estate segment, was nearly flat, increasing 10 basis points from 33.4% in the fourthquarter of 2016 to 33.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was driven by a 59 basis point decrease in personnel expenses, a 30 basis point decreasein occupancy expenses and a 19 basis point decrease in stock-based compensation. It was partially offset by a 50 basis point increase in transactionbonuses and a 33 basis point increase in tours and field events. We continued to invest in the businesses accounted for in our other segment, including Redfin Now, Mortgage and title services. We don't breakout the results for these businesses, but combined, they lost $524,000 in gross profit compared to a gross profit loss of $475,000 in the fourthquarter of 2016. Operating expenses showed continued leverage, growing 18% year-over-year, representing 33% of revenue, down from 40% of revenue 1 yearago. This reflects our continued commitment to growing our fixed costs slower than revenue, and we expect this trend to continue into 2018.     One note is that we recorded a $1.8 million expense during the fourth quarter of 2016 for a pending legal settlement. Our net loss, including stock-based compensation and depreciation, was $1.8 million, an improvement from a $5.3 million net loss in the fourthquarter of 2016. The new tax regulation had no impact on our fourth quarter earnings because we currently hold a full valuation allowance againstour deferred tax assets and liabilities. Diluted net loss per common share was $0.02 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with an $8.08 diluted net loss per common share in thefourth quarter of 2016. The prior year loss was primarily driven by the fair market value feature of our redeemable convertible preferred stock whichconverted to common stock in connection with our IPO. Excluding the impact of the redeemable convertible preferred stock, which is now convertedto common stock, adjusted diluted net loss per common share for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $0.08. Adjusted diluted net loss per commonshare included stock-based compensation. Before I move to our 2018 outlook, I'd like to briefly recap our full year 2017 performance. Our customers booked over $21 billion in real estatetransactions. Compared to a 5% commission, we saved our brokerage customers over $121 million. We delivered full year revenue of over $370million, up 38% year-over-year and gross profit of over $111 million, up 35%. Our total operating expenses grew 21%, and net loss for the yearnarrowed from $22.5 million in 2016 to $15.0 million in 2017. Now turning to our financial expectations for the first quarter of 2018. Revenue is expected to be between $74.6 million and $78.4 million, representingyear-over-year growth between 25% and 31%. We expect Redfin Now to account for $2.3 million to $3.1 million of total revenue. Net loss is expectedto be between $38.7 million and $35.9 million compared with a $28.1 million net loss in the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, our losses areseasonal, driven in part by the timing of our revenue. From 2015 to 2017, between 15.4% and 16.2% of our full year revenue came in the first quarter.And March is, by far, the largest month of the first quarter given the seasonal ramp. It's also the month that we have the least revenue visibility toas we speak today. This guidance includes approximately $4.5 million of stock-based compensation and $1.8 million of depreciation and amortization.It assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements are concluded and thatthere are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates.

So we expect inventory to continue to decline and that the market will continue to get more competitive, as I said in the preparedremarks. We do think, though, that we can increase close rate modestly over the next 12 months. And the reason we think that is that every timewe've made a change like this in the past, we've had a similar effect. So if you look at cohorts of agents who had fewer customers in 2017, you seethat those agents closed at a higher rate, even if you look in markets where inventory was extremely low. If you look at years where it was also astrong seller's market, but we limited the number of customers each agent met, we saw higher close rates. So I think this is going to have a positiveimpact on close rate. What isn't understood is how positive that will be. So the market is going to work against us, and we're just going to fight thetide.",True,False

1032,64389860,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call,Glenn Kelman,Redfin Corporation,"Well, we try to understand that in 2 different ways. There are ways to save agents' time and then there are ways to increase close rate. And mostof our labor-saving software is really focused on the support staff because those folks are performing a high number of repetitive tasks where wecan either automate it or simplify it so that we can take $10, $20, $50, $100 out of the deal by just having fewer support staff per agent. But withthe agent, the name of the game is really to increase close rate. And the way that we do that is giving agents better tools to serve our customers.So if you notice that a customer is online on our website, but just hasn't been active with the brokerage, that's a signal that you probably need toreach out and see what's going on. If you notice that the customer is searching often but hasn't set up online alerts, that's a sign that you need todo that for the customer. So I think most of the software that we're developing over the course of this year is to personalize the service so that weknow more about what that customer needs at any given moment and can be there to deliver that service at the right time. And we think that itcan significantly increase close rate because we still spend most of our time with people who don't end up buying a house.",True,False

Certainly, many of us still live in the Bay Area have seen the billboards. Justcurious, from a quarter or 2 back, are you finding this to be a more expensive endeavor than maybe originally planned and you -- did you plan onaccelerating these investments on the advertising side or has this been kind of in the books? I know you mentioned this is the largest campaignthat you've run. I'm just curious if you could kind of walk through how you're thinking about the expense structure.",True,False

So we just wanted to put everyone on notice that if we see that opportunity to grow faster,we'll take it. And the reason that we have increasing confidence in advertising is because we have started to see some durable awareness gainsfrom ads that we ran last year. We have a campaign that we really believe in. The simplicity of the 1% message lends itself well to billboards andradio ads. And we think it's really going to result directly in more sales. So just having seen some encouraging results, we wanted to maintain ourdiscipline this year, but also let everyone know that there is the possibility that we will invest more aggressively in the future. So that is the mostlikely outcome that we would see an opportunity in future years. It's also possible that we would say, ""Actually, this is going so well. We want toinvest more aggressively now."" But that's not what we had in mind when we prepared the remarks. So our main thesis was that, in future years,we could see a larger opportunity to advertise.

1042,64389860,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call,Glenn Kelman,Redfin Corporation,"Well, we ask ourselves every time there's a slowdown or a pickup, ""Is it us?

And so we're trying to take measures to grow despite that, and that's why we focus so much on share. When you will see us reallybecome troubled is if we start seeing market share gains significantly decelerate. It's always going to be somewhat sawtooth, but over quarters,halves, years, we expect market share to grow fairly steadily.

Glenn, it sounds like you guys aren't planning on doing the 1% across the boardanytime soon. But just 2 questions. Do you ever envision a day where that 1% would be across the board in the U.S.? And then I guess, secondly,as the industry starts to mimic your pricing, do you ever envision maybe even going below that 1% percent mark?",True,False
1046,64389860,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call,Glenn Kelman,Redfin Corporation,"Interesting question. So first of all, we are always focused on lowering our cost of goods sold so that we can expand our addressable market, sellhomes that are very inexpensive and still make a profit or pass the savings on to our customer by offering 1% to more markets. But I don't thinkwe'll do that in the next 6 months or 12 months. That's a long-term grind to make that pricing work in places where homes sell for $150,000 a year.We do think that more competitors are going to try to match that price. That is obviously ground on which we like to fight because we've been sofocused on efficiency for so long. So if the market begins to agree that consumers really care about price, I think that's a world where Redfin canreally prosper more than any other brokerage. To go below 1% is possible. I think you have to start thinking about other ways to sell houses thataren't so labor-intensive. A long time ago, for example, we asked customers to host their own open houses. And back in that day, they did not likeit. They want us to be there, putting the directionals out on the corner and bringing in flowers and everything else. So I think it's possible that thereis a new type of customer out there who wants a new product, but I would think about pricing that's significantly below 1% as inviting a new listingproduct. It would be a counterpart on the other end to the concierge product that we developed, which really is serving a customer who wantsjust a new level of convenience. And we thought we could take the economic advantage we've developed to actually let us invest more in thehouse, more in the service than other brokerage traditionally have.

We just rolled     out 1% to almost all of our customers, and it's having a very sharp effect in 2017 and even in 2018.

Terry,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Glenn, curious, we saw a little bit of an increase in revenue per transaction or revenue per home sold in the brokerage part of the business, whichis pretty counter to the trend that we had seen over time. How much of that -- what should we think about as being sort of the underlying driversfrom that -- for that? Is it an increase in the value of the homes being sold? Is it a function of moving up market in certain areas? And then as wethink about the efforts around driving more traffic to the site and sort of brand-building, should we expect that that's largely going to take theform of television advertising? Or do you see opportunities in online beyond the performance-based advertising that you've been doing thus far?.",True,False
1053,64389860,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call,Glenn Kelman,Redfin Corporation,"Well, let me take the first question first. I may ask Chris to weigh in with some additional detail. But the pricing or the revenue per transaction isreally a function of mix shift. So we save customers a lot of money when they sell a house through us. We save them a still significant, but lessmoney, when they buy a house through us. And so we're always calibrating our pricing, especially the refunds that we give to buyers, there's acommission that's paid to us as the buyer's agent, and then we give a portion of that to the buyer. And we change that amount as the mix shiftstowards listings. So we're trying to keep revenue per transaction steady quarter through quarter through quarter. And if the listing business growsa little faster than we expected, then we have to lower the commission refund a little faster than we expected. And so what you saw happen nowis just pricing ahead of that. So we know that listings are going to continue to grow very quickly, and we wanted to price ahead of that. And I wouldexpect that, that will neutralize as listing share catches up to that so that revenue per transaction basically remains constant. And what that meansis that much of our gross margin upside comes from lowering cost per transaction, not trying to increase prices on the consumer. I think it's possiblethat we can move up market. Generally, as we do that, we also move down market. We're fairly acquisitive about share. And so if we sell moreexpensive houses, it gives us a little bit of latitude to also take on customers who are buying more affordable houses, too. Chris, do you want toadd anything to that?",True,False

Everyone sees that coming. More peopleare spending more time online. It's just that the major Internet platforms are pricing that into their ads. So we will probably see some of our mediamove online, but we're still definitely interested in learning about all the ways we can reach people through traditional media. So we've just begunwith radio and outdoor. And the reason we did that is we just thought we had such a good message for, say, a billboard. Everyone should just knowin a town that you can sell a house for 1% instead of a 2.5% or 3%. And a billboard is the perfect way to get that out. So we wanted to try it.",True,False

So I just want to make sure I understand how the seller mix, which sounds like it's still growing as an overall mix versus the buyer mix, how theseller mix actually impacts the gross margins of the business. Could you have higher agent productivity because you're more or less guaranteeda sale representing the seller and you don't have as much of an impact from the homebuyer taking longer to find a house or close on a house?

1060,64389860,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Redfin Corp Earnings Call,Glenn Kelman,Redfin Corporation,"Well, we make more money from buyers even though it's harder to buy a house than it is to sell one. And that's just because our fees are higherwhen we represent a buyer than when we represent a seller. We keep more of the commission in that situation. So what you're seeing as we havemore and more listings as a percentage of our overall sales is that we have to keep more of the commission that is given to us, rather than refundingsuch a large portion to the buyer. And that's how we keep revenue per transaction between buyers and sellers basically flat year-to-year. And whathappened last year is we got a little bit behind that because listings grew a little faster than we expected. And now what we're doing is trying toprice just a little bit ahead of that, but the goal is to keep revenue per transaction flat. And trying to answer your question, just remember, we makemore money from buyers than sellers.

And that's, aswe said, because the seller is so much more price-sensitive. She signs a contract before listing her house. She agrees to a price before listing herhouse when she chooses an agent. And so in Denver and San Diego and Seattle and places like that, we had run 1% pricing for years. And wecarefully studied whether that hurt our share among buyers, whether it helped our share among sellers. And what we determined was that, overall,it had a positive effect.

So 2017 was a momentous year for BioMarin driven by significant financial,regulatory and clinical achievements. For the full year 2017, revenues topped $1.3 billion, which is an increase of 18% compared to 2016. We received U.S. and EU approvals for Brineura for the treatment of CLN2 in less than 4 years from the first patient being treated with our product.As a result of that approval, we received a pediatric Priority Review Voucher, which we sold for more than half of Brineura's development cost.Including safety and efficacy data from our Phase I/II study with gene therapy product, valoctocogene roxaparvovec or valrox, for the treatmentof severe Hemophilia A resulted in the launch of 2 separate Phase III studies, one of which started last December and the other one will start earlythis year. Normally, I have authority supportive of the program. We received both prime and breakthrough designations. The patient community is veryenthusiastic about valrox, the notion of a potentially one-and-done treatment option for a patient community who dealt in the past with frequentjoint bleeds and the need to always have access to rescue medications even in the face of taking multiple weekly infusions of recombinant factorVIII was inconceivable before gene therapy. Momentum is definitely building in this area of development in hemophilia, and we are thrilled to be at the forefront. Hank will provide additionalupdates on valrox and our earlier stage programs shortly. Turning to our other late-stage development program, pegvaliase and visoritide, both of which progressed as expected over the year. At R&D Daylast October, we shared data with visoritide in achondroplasia demonstrating consistent durability and safety over 30 months in our Phase I/IIsubjects. The global Phase III program continues to enroll as planned, and we anticipate completion mid-year. The BLA for our next potential commercial product, pegvaliase, was filed last June and we look forward to the PDUFA outcome in late May. ThePKU market represents a significant opportunity as we have seen with Kuvan. And Jeff will walk us through his plans and our plans for the launchand execution of commercial pegvaliase in the U.S. in a moment. Looking forward to 2018, double digit growth of revenue should continue, with total revenue expected to be between $1.47 billion to $1.53 billion,representing growth of between 15% to 19% compared to 2017 results. In 2017, we reached non-GAAP income of $74 million for the year. And in 2018, we expect to improve upon those results to a range of $100 millionto $140 million in non-GAAP income, a 62% improvement from the midpoint. In the years to come, we intend to steadily increase bottom line results, while continuing to reinvest in our pipeline. In summary, 2017 was not only our 20th anniversary year, but also one of our most productive to date. As I have just reviewed our accomplishmentsin 2017, I've laid the foundation for even greater productivity and execution in 2018 across the clinical regulatory and commercial pipelines. Now I will now turn the call over to Jeff who will review the Commercial business in more details. Jeff?",False,True
1079,64389974,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc Earnings Call,Jeffrey Robert Ajer,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,"Thank you, J.J. We delivered record results of sales in 2017 and I'm very pleased with total BioMarin revenues for full year 2017 exceeding theprevious year by 18% and breaking the $1.3 billion mark for the first time. Starting with Vimizim. Patients on commercial therapy grew 20% in 2017, as well as a continued rise in identified patients increasing to over 2,000worldwide. With only roughly half of the currently identified patients on commercial therapy and the fact that we continue to identify new patients,there is opportunity for significant continued growth from here. Vimizim net product revenues were $114 million in the fourth quarter and $413 million for the full year, increases of 22% and 17%, respectively,compared to the same periods in 2016. Last quarter, we had communicated risks associated with order patterns in Brazil. I'm glad to report that the fourth quarter reflected positiveordering from Brazil, but we remain cautious on Brazil quarter-to-quarter in 2018 due to anticipated uneven buying patterns. Other areas of strengthin the fourth quarter included the EUMEA region, with Turkey in particular, Colombia in Latin America and North America. Looking towards full year 2018 Vimizim guidance, we expect continued revenue growth of between $460 million and $500 million in full yearrevenues. Moving on to Naglazyme. Net product revenues were $94 million in the quarter and $332 million for the full year, increases of 25% and 12%,respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. Significantly, the number of commercial patients increased by 6% in 2017, an indicator of thecontinued growth and underlying demand for Naglazyme. Consistent with Vimizim results, Naglazyme sales benefited from an uptick in Brazilian orders in the fourth quarter. As a result, we remain cautiouslyoptimistic that sales in Brazil will be steady in 2018, but also anticipate uneven buying patterns quarter-to-quarter. Our Naglazyme guidance forfull year 2018 net product revenues is between $325 million and $355 million. Now onto Kuvan. 2017 represented the second full year of global sales of Kuvan by BioMarin since the acquisition of the PKU franchise at internationalmarkets for Merck Serono and we are very pleased with the results. Kuvan net products revenue contributed over $107 million to the top line inthe fourth quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year. For the full year, Kuvan net product revenue was $408 million, a 17% increase over 2016. North American sales were paced by an increase of 7% in commercial patients year-over-year. The combination of strong results in North America,combined with solid uptake internationally, gives us confidence in providing full year 2018 guidance of between $440 million and $480 million,an increase of about 13% over 2017 results. Turning now to Brineura, which was approved in both the U.S. and EU in 2017. As we said when we got approval, the commercial strategy forBrineura is different than for our typical ERT products. Our primary focus is on raising awareness among physicians to facilitate early diagnosis. Thegoal is to have patients screened and diagnosed early, while they retain good function and are good candidates for treatment, and that will continueto be our focus going forward. The initial Brineura launch is rolling out as anticipated. We are seeing a gradual steady ramp of new countries and additional sites for payer toprovide treatment and as a result, patients are being transitioned to receive commercial Brineura. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, we hadover 40 commercial patients worldwide, spanning 7 countries and 22 treatment sites. We continue to expect to have about 40 sites equipped to provide treatment with Brineura by mid this year. Our efforts to raise awareness ofBrineura and the importance of the early diagnosis is progressing nicely. The number of physicians experienced in Brineura is expanding and driving interest in the communities. We have learned a few things over thefirst few quarters of launch, including that new site readiness can take longer than expected due to the complexity of multidisciplinary preparation     within hospitals. However, we view this as part of the process given the uniqueness of Brineura and believe we are on track to manage any challengesrelated to the complexity of planning port surgery and infusions. The early diagnosis programs we have put in place are gaining momentum. 100 institutions across the U.S. have participated to date in our Behindthe Seizure program, resulting in several children with CLN2 being diagnosed through that program. In Europe where we are navigating throughcountry-by-country reimbursement, we are on track and expect steady progress throughout 2018. We are very pleased with the pace of the launchtoday and expect growing awareness of Brineura in the physician and CLN2 community. As a result, we expect solid revenue growth in 2018,resulting in full year guidance of between $35 million and $55 million. Finally, now turning to pegvaliase for which we expect to learn U.S. approval status in late May. We are cautiously optimistic that a U.S. commerciallaunch will be under way in the second half of this year. As we have communicated, upon the potential approval of pegvaliase, we will take a slow-and-go approach to the commercial launch. We havelearned over the course of developing pegvaliase that patients respond at varying rates, so we plan to take additional time upfront during theinduction and titration phase of treatment to get it right and keep patients on therapy up to and through the maintenance phase of treatment. The feedback we've gotten from the over 200 patients currently in our clinical studies is that working through the first phase of treatment is worththe time and effort to get to maintenance therapy. We appreciate the many of you who are interested in knowing more about how we are thinking about pricing pegvaliase, so I would like to sharethe following. The specifics of pricing will be available upon approval, but we do expect to price pegvaliase at a modest premium to the averageprice from an adult Kuvan patient, currently about $150,000 annually, net. Further, during the initial induction titration phase of treatment, we would expect revenue to be fractional and then transition to full pricing oncemaintenance dosing has been achieved. We're very excited about the opportunity with pegvaliase as it will be a significant component of our PKUfranchise. In the U.S., we expect pegvaliase will be the approved treatment of choice for adults, complementing Kuvan, which is and will continue to betreatment of choice for children. Pegvaliase has proven to be highly efficacious in severe PKU adults resulting in significant reductions of phenylalanine. We believe the market isexcited about the approval of pegvaliase and that there's a lot of interest in gaining access once it is approved. We have years of experience working directly with the 35 clinical trial sites in the U.S. of the 125 total PKU clinics in the U.S. and, therefore, anticipatehitting the ground running in product approval. As was the case with Brineura, we do not provide guidance -- revenue guidance in an approvaland launch year, so we look forward to keeping you apprised with our progress with pegvaliase following the outcome of our late May PDUFA. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to provide more detail on the fourth quarter and full year financial results. Dan?",False,True
1080,64389974,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc Earnings Call,Daniel K. Spiegelman,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,"Thanks, Jeff. Please see today's press release summarizing our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2017. Since Jeff alreadyreviewed 2017 revenue results and provided detailed 2018 revenue guidance, I will cover other 2017 result items and then provide our 2018 andlonger term financial guidance. Two key Q4 items to point out: first is the sale of the Priority Review Voucher for $125 million. The proceeds are classified as a gain on sale of anintangible asset in operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Associated with the sale, there is also a provision for taxexpense of approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter results were also impacted by charges associated with the Tax Reform     higher than last year's result. The main drivers of the 2018 cost of sales rate increase are related to additional production capacity from the Shanballyfacility coming online. More specifically, the Shanbally, Ireland facility approval results in some nonrecurring charges being recognized in 2018. But more importantly,increased per unit production costs at current volumes. As revenues increase and new products get approved, we will more fully utilize that capacity.And as that capacity gets utilized, we expect the cost of sales line to return to historical levels. Looking further out, both visoritide and valrox could have substantially improved gross margins, which could drive down our long-term cost ofsales level below our historic levels. In terms of capital spending, we expect overall capital investment in 2018 to be similar to 2017 and between $160 million and $180 million, primarilyin manufacturing and laboratory facilities. In addition, there will be an approximately $70 million to $90 million investment in additional inventoryto support new product launches and revenue growth. Finally, please recall that per our prior guidance, we intend to repay the $375 million principal amount of our maturing 2018 bonds in cash, regardlessof whether they mature in the money or not. Even with these capital and cash outlays, we continue to believe that our existing financial resources mean we won't need to do additional equityor equity-linked financings except in the 3 circumstances we've previously mentioned: potential M&A; refinancing our 2020 or '24 converts; or amajor product setback.

Starting with valrox. It is remarkable to reflect on where the program was only a year ago. You may recall, when we started our program, we werehoping to convert patients from severe to mild hemophilia. Last year, we were talking to you about the proof of concept results observed in 2016in which we were going well beyond achieving a milder state of hemophilia. We augmented our plans with the addition of the 4E13 vector genomesper kilo dose, and here we are today having demonstrated positive efficacy and safety data in our Phase I/II program that led to the launch of PhaseIII GENEr8-1 and GENEr8--2 studies, both of which are open for enrollment. Importantly, with the start of these pivotal studies, we're seeing anincrease in the level of enthusiasm for valrox from the patient and physician communities. At our most recent data update at ASH last December, we were very excited to update results after treatment of patients with the 6E13 vector perkilo -- vector genomes per kilo dose. Most patients have achieved and maintained Factor VIII levels within the normal range in severe hemophiliaA. Further, median annualized bleeding rates and vector use continue to be 0 for both metrics at that time point. We also shared up to 1 year resultswith the 4E13 vector genomes per kilogram dose for 3 patients with the longest follow-up with Factor VIII levels in or near the normal range. Asthe -- as a whole, the 4E13 vector genomes per kilo dose results at that time point, demonstrated sustained Factor VIII levels approaching or withinthe lower end of the normal range for most patients. The 4E13 vector genome per kilo dose subjects also had median annualized bleeding ratesand factor use of 0 as of that time point. Concurrent with ASH, The New England Journal of Medicine published preliminary results of the ongoing Phase I/II study of valrox. The accompanyingeditorial titled, ""A Cure for Hemophilia within Reach,"" highlighted the tremendous need for better therapy for patients because of the residual riskof bleeding, the high cost of prophylactic therapy and the demanding nature of intermittent factor replacement. The editorial also established an     patients are thrilled with the benefits they've experienced with pegvaliase. We're hoping that their voice will be heard as our application is reviewedfor potential approval and we look forward to keeping you apprised on our progress in the U.S. and our plans to submit the European Unionmarketing authorization application later in the first quarter of this year for potential European approval in 2019.

I think what I -- the context I'd put on things now is that just a reminder that Brineuragot approved in the United States on the basis of 96-week data and in Europe on the basis of 72-week data. And finally, it was triggered actually     on the basis of 48-week data, big credit goes to the health authorities for being able to include more updated data in the package inserts on thebasis of relatively rapid real-time review. So in the context of Brineura, 48 weeks by itself was enough. I -- we don't know about the efficacy of thefull cohort of patients at 48 weeks, so that's why it's premature to speculate. But what I'd say is, is that based on Brineura, we have made substantialimprovements in the 250 programs. Specifically, we're using the same exact tool to measure outcome in a natural history context as in the treatmentcontext. We're measuring those development quotient improvements in the same patients, not different patients. Those were -- that was a bigpart of the Brineura review and we've eliminated that as a concern for the 250 application. In addition, unlike Brineura, in the case of 250, there'sa very good biomarker for biological activity of the product. And finally, unlike with Brineura where there were no systemic manifestations of thedisease to follow, we've already demonstrated normalization of liver size, which I'll remind you, has been a basis of approval for other enzymereplacement therapies. So we're cautiously optimistic about the progress we've made with 250. I think that we're ahead of where we were at asimilar time in the case of Brineura and as to kind of what magnitude of improvement would trigger either another study or an application, I thinkit's a matter of stay tuned.",True,False

And then on the commercial front, assuming that pegvaliase is, indeed, approved in May, I can appreciate the slow and steadyinitial launch curve, but how should we be thinking about some of the headwinds and tailwinds for this product? What do you see as the biggestneedle movers there that we should be thinking about?",True,False
1090,64389974,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc Earnings Call,Jeffrey Robert Ajer,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,"Yes, so Cory, I think the first thing I would say is the picture is simplified by the fact that we're only anticipating launching in the United States nextyear. We have over 200 clinical trial patients, a majority of which we would expect to be able to transition to commercial during the course of theyear, assuming an approval date on or around our PDUFA. So that's a tailwind. For na�ve to treatment patients, we have to get through the inductionand titration phase. That would be something like a 12- to 24-week period on average, but also noting that some patients have taken longer than24 weeks to reach a maintenance phase. During that period of time, patients will be taking a variety of doses. So we've got 3 prefilled syringe SKUs,we would anticipate a 2.5-microgram, a 10-microgram and a 20-microgram dose. And so depending on the dosing schedule, there would befractional revenues during the induction titration phase, starting out at 1 syringe per week early in the induction and titration phase. So onlyfractional revenue during induction and titration. And that would eat up the majority of the calendar year of 2018 for na�ve to treatment patients.So if you consider that to be a bit of a headwind. In terms of new patient enrollment, 35 of the 125 PKU clinics in the United States have experienceusing pegvaliase through the clinical trial program. So that gives us a good base of experience to start off from. And we know that those investigatorsare interested in trialing new patients when pegvaliase is approved. We also know that they've guided that they would start patients in relativelysmall batches. Think several -- or several-ish. Work them up through the initial induction and titration phase to something approaching maintenancedosing and then starting the next batch of patients and so on. So that will be kind of a measured pace of new patient introduction of the pegvaliase.And then for the about 90 PKU clinics in the United States that don't have experience through the clinical trial program, we have the usual educationprocess to get through before we would anticipate they would trial patients. We would anticipate and, in fact, guide those clinics to start withseveral-ish patients, be very deliberate about having good experiences, good initial experiences with pegvaliase and then starting additionalpatients.

Just first, I'm curious on the decision to wait on starting a pediatric program until there'san approval in adults. I think you guys have said that for a while. Can you maybe clarify, is this driven by FDA's direction or is this your decision?And I guess, the reason I'm asking is it's kind of striking with today's announcement that you're starting an infant study for visoritide, sort of whynot apply maybe the same logic to pegvaliase? And then maybe on the commercial side, I was struck by your comments that revenue for titrationpatients would be fractional. I thought I heard you guys say earlier that you would not be pricing this on a per milligram basis and rather by SKUs.Can you maybe give a little bit more color? Should we think about it in terms of the amount of drug? Or is there some other measure?",True,False
1094,64389974,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc Earnings Call,Jean,Jacques Bienaim�,"Hank, you want to go pegvaliase?",True,False
1095,64389974,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc Earnings Call,Henry J. Fuchs,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,"Sure, thanks, Chris. The considerations with pegvaliase has all along been -- it's a foreign protein that's PEGylated within an elicited immuneresponse. We really wanted to build a good safety database before going into children. And that is an especially important consideration in thecontext in which there is an alternative form of therapy for children, namely medical and nutritional therapy. And that's different -- that's one aspectthat's different from our other indications and another -- and therefore, sort of the ongoing accrual of damage is blunted in PKU as compared withour other enzyme replacement therapy business. So I think those things, those 2 things combined, the nature of the product and wanting to builda really strong safety database as well as the availability of medical and nutritional, the compliance with medical and nutritional therapy, which ishigher in children than it is in adults, suggests to us to take a more measured approach with these children. Now upon regulatory action, clearly,that can be revisited. And Chris, on the subject of why the fractional revenue during the induction and titration phase. Thinking about pegvaliase patients in a maintenancesetting where they would likely be receiving either 20-milligram or 40-milligram per day maintenance dosing, we would be pricing principally onexpectations of how to price for maintenance dosing. I mentioned earlier that we're anticipating that we would have 3 different prefilled syringeSKUs, 2.5-milligram syringe, 10-milligram syringe and 20-milligram syringe. In the United States, the most likely method of pricing pegvaliase wouldbe either pricing on a per milligram basis or pricing on a per syringe basis. In the maintenance space dose setting, imagine a 20-milligram per daypatient receiving 1 20-milligram syringe per day. In an induction and titration phase, same patient would be starting out at 1 2.5-milligram syringe,once a week, and the frequency of that syringe use increasing, getting to the point of switching to a 10-milligram syringe and then all the way upto a daily dose of 20-milligram in this case. So whether we price on a per syringe basis or a per milligram basis, during the induction and titrationphase, the patients would be getting a fractional price essentially during that period. And that fractional piece would be shifting from very low inthe range initially to higher in the range as they get further through the induction of the titration process.",True,False

And just to clarify, you said that they will -- the centers that are already online will treat several [LISH] patients in thebeginning.

A couple of the things that I think will be impactful in year 1 for the na�ve to experience clinics are, one, what we wouldanticipate is a kind of a guidelines document to be published shortly after pegvaliase approval. We'll receive it at the end of May. That would beone piece. And that the second piece would be to find kind of peer-to-peer opportunities to leverage the experience of the clinical trial investigatorsto share with their non-experienced peers some tips and guidance on working through their initial patients. In terms of the induction and titrationphase, the maintenance and the notion of starting several patients, several [LISH] patients, getting them through the induction-titration phasebefore starting additional patients, what we've heard the clinical trial investigators say is that, it's exactly the 12- to 24-week period that is normalfor induction and titration, that is the most intensive period for them to be managing dose adjustments, potential adverse events, that sort of thing.Once they get through those, the dose adjustments and period where adverse events are most likely to occur, then the workload on those patientsgoes down significantly.

And the reasons for that are -- and if you're -- if you go back to the Brineura review,we were talking about where is the FDA's focus? And we had said comparability of endpoints and comparability of patients. And that was drivenby the fact that the patients in the control setting were different patients than the patients in the treatment setting. And those control patientswere assessed using a set of tools that were developed by an academic, whereas the tools that we used were more drug industry appropriate tools-- similar conceptually, but not literally the same. In contrast, we are generating a roughly comparably-sized natural history data set, but in thiscase with 250, we're using the same tools for natural history as for treatment. And now the tools will be -- the evaluations will be in the same patientsbefore treatment and after treatment.

You can probably (inaudible) in general, it's obviously beenrelatively fertile area for drug development. However, the MPS III family of disorders has been a little bit more challenging because the disease isprincipally a brain disease or one of the most important (inaudible) are in the CNS. And given the blood-brain barrier, it's been a difficult nut tocrack. As you know, companies have tried sort of a subtler approaches like lumbar intrathecal delivery of relatively low doses and, unfortunately,Shire abandoned a program in IIIa with that approach after having gone on a clinical hold for device-related complications. Also, as you know,Synageva, then Alexion had a program of IV delivery and had initially demonstrated some potential evidence of biological activity in the centralnervous system after intravenous delivery.

Now obviously, that's all preclinical work and theessential clinical question will be whether we can establish a positive therapeutic index, that is to say, frataxin upregulation without accompanyingmild suppression. We're cautiously optimistic based on our preclinical data that we can do that, but human clinical experiments will be requiredto demonstrate that.

1121,64389974,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc Earnings Call,Jeffrey Robert Ajer,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,"Yes. So payment models are a key variable for gene therapies. We're seeing how that's playing out already with the initial approvals in the U.S. andEurope of initial products. In the United States, some of the models that have been discussed, which might include payment over time, paymentfor positive results, something like a rebate for patients that don't respond adequately, those models are going to be challenging to implementunless they're -- until the problem of how to account for government price calculations is solved for. There may be solutions for that, but that's abarrier to implementing those kinds of programs in the United States. And outside of the United States, in single-payer like models, those kind ofreimbursement models are probably easier to navigate and impossible to implement. And from BioMarin's perspective, I think, our principal interestin pricing reimbursement model is to be able to capture as much value as possible as valrox may provide: number one on a clinical value basis;     number two, on a quality of life value basis; and number three, in terms of a cost process to what is a very expensive life-long treatment regimentoday. So we want to capture as much value as possible across all 3 of those dimensions, and we are open to different reimbursement models thatwill allow us to capture that value.",True,False

Cost structure-wise, frankly,neither vosoritide nor valrox would be materially different than what we've dealt with in the past. As you know, from a manufacturing standpoint,actually the initial commercial scaling manufacturing plant is done. We've talked about being able to handle 2,000 to 3,000 patients a year out ofthat facility. There are things we could potentially do to even expand that and for additional demand we can to construct capacity either here orelsewhere. Commercial structures would be -- and resources, would be similar to what we've utilized in the past.

I would say our appetite for large transformational deal isrelatively low at this time -- that could change -- but however, we are always interested in earlier stage opportunities that would be strategicallycoherent with our overall strategy of continuing to develop first-in-class or best-in-class products for rare genetic disorders. I mean, obviously,because of the size of the company now, we are achieving $1.5 billion of revenues this year, I would say, unlikely we will move much or continueto -- or develop products for ultra or ultra-orphan or very, very small patient population.

So what's the trigger for us is that when we have done all the work andall the preclinical analysis that makes us comfortable that we are willing to move towards pre-IND activities and move towards initiating earlierclinical trials. So we're getting to a point, it's likely that it will happen for 1 or 2 of them between now and end of the year, though I mean, theywould not be 2018 and '19, but likely mid-2019 or early '20.

So we want to capture value acrossall 3 of those dimensions. And you're absolutely right. Pricing over time, based on durability of effect, for example, could be an excellent vehiclefor allowing us to do that. In the United States, there are some practical implications to Medicaid pricing reports that manufacturers must do andthat needs to be solved for before some of these more creative programs can be implemented in the United States. A potential solution would beCMS approving so-called demonstration projects or programs that would be submitted by a sponsor like a BioMarin.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, Appian subscription revenue grew 42% year-over-year to$23.5 million. Our non-GAAP loss from operations was $4.9 million compared to the loss of $1.8 million in the prior year quarter. We were cash flow positive in Q4, generating $1 million in cash flow from operations. Our subscription revenue retention remained high at 122%as of December 31, 2017. Our professional services revenue was also high at $25.2 million with non-GAAP gross margin of 37%. For the full year, subscription revenue grew by 38% to $82.8 million. And finally, of net new subscription customers for all of 2017, we added 85versus 28 in the prior year. These results exceeded our guidance. Appian's growth in 2017 has a lot to do with being in the right place, being well positioned. The positioning is very simple. Companies today needto build unique software applications. Traditional methods are expensive and slow. Appian has an easy answer. We let customers draw an applicationlike a flowchart, rather than code it. We let them assemble an application from premade objects like reusable LEGO bricks. This approach is 6 to20x faster than a regular development. Best of all, the applications built on our platform are powerful. They're scalable, secure, cloud-ready, highlyavailable and native on all major mobile devices. Appian applications run banks, airports, insurers, retailers, et cetera. We're making it easy to build unique industrial-strength software. That's anability the world is excited to buy right now. Our goal in 2018 is to bring this simple winning proposition to more customers. We're learning a lot about how large organizations want to buildand use unique software. We channel this knowledge back into vertical marketing and sales campaigns, some of which showed great success in2017. In pharma, for example, we grew subscription revenue 53% over the full year. Currently, 6 of the top 10 pharma companies use Appian tomanage critical business processes like clinical trials management and pharmacovigilance. In Q4, we had new and expansion wins at 3 of the top5 global pharmaceutical companies, and pharma subs revenue grew 70% versus the prior year period. The first of these large wins was a significant expansion deal at an existing multi -- an existing $1 million-per-year customer. With this deal, whichdoubles their annual spend with us, they'll now use Appian to deliver new medical devices to market, replacing a sprawled -- homegrown appsand spreadsheets. Among the significant new name wins was a European multinational pharmaceutical customer who plans to use Appian to manage itspharmacovigilance process. Their application will manage drug safety reporting and replace a disjointed mix of systems including MicrosoftSharePoint, Lotus Notes, databases and e-mail. We were selected over 2 large competitors because we successfully delivered a powerful application during a 2-day proof of concept. Following the win, we developed and deployed the full solution in 9 weeks. I mention this to highlight our speed edge. We're fast to show value,and a 2-day POC, or proof of concept, suits us very well, but we're also remarkably quick to get full applications into production. Our European investments over the past few years bore fruit in 2017. In Q4, European revenue was 20% of total revenue as compared to 11% inthe prior year period. For all of 2017, European subscription revenue rose 91%, and total revenue doubled year-over-year. Notably, Europe alsoprovided 32 net new subscription customers in 2017. In Europe, we gained one of the world's major beverage companies as a new customer inQ4. They wanted to replace their restaurant leasing system, currently running on paper, Excel and e-mail, with a more scalable and transparent     solution. They chose Appian over 2 large competitors after we showed superior alignment with their team and a fully integrated application in ashort proof of concept. We also had a number of key Q4 expansion deals in Europe. We won a multimillion-dollar deal at MHRA, a governmental agency in the UnitedKingdom. We added $1 million follow-on deals at 2 of the top 20 global banks and at GRDF, an energy service company that serves 90% of the gasmarket in France. GRDF became a customer in 2015 with the purchase of 2,500 user licenses. Over the last 2.5 years, they've expanded their use of Appian by buildingmore applications and adding more users opportunistically. With our platform, they've improved service to their 11 million customers by bettermanaging gas supplier requests, energy loss, gas and network extensions and meter connections. In 2017, GRDF wanted a more strategic relationship and to use Appian globally so they increased their investment to allow them to grow to 10,000users. Perhaps the most important trend in our business today is the one towards stronger partnerships. Partners are sourcing more business for us. In2017, the total value of partner-referred deals was 3.5x as much as in 2016. Partners brought us 30 new customers last year, which was more thanAppian's total increase in new customers in 2016. Here's a quick example to show how partner relationships facilitate our growth in new places. In Q4, we pursued a $1 million deal in Poland witha large global bank. They wanted to modernize their operations on a platform with strong Robotic Process Automation and case managementcapabilities. We're leaders in both of those markets, so we're an excellent fit. But because Poland is new to us, we relied on Deloitte's strong localpresence and capabilities. Our technical strength and our partnership with Deloitte won this deal against 2 major competitors. In addition to significantly increasing our subscription customer base in 2017, we were also more successful on a per-customer basis. The averageACV for our 2017 new customers was slightly higher than in 2016, indicating that we maintained deal quality as we captured more customers. We also raised our average revenue per customer to $496,000. Finally, for the past 3 years, we maintained an LTV to CAC ratio above 7. We showed value quickly, and we gained quick upsells. For example, there'sa large U.S. bank who bought our software last September. We delivered their first application within 5 weeks. As a result, they expanded theirinvestment in Appian with a multimillion-dollar purchase just 3 months following their initial order. In our judgment, the market opportunity, combined with Appian's demonstrated ability to reach and satisfy that market warrants an incrementalincrease in investment in 2018. As you may know, investment is not Appian's first instinct, even in a growing market. We broke even, roughly, ona cash flow basis from the day we were founded to our IPO last May. We are instinctively frugal. We plan a $10 million acceleration in our expendituresfor 2018, and our justification for this is as follows. First, our market shows high growth potential. We grew full year subs revenue 38% and we morethan tripled our rate of new logo acquisition in 2017. Second, our technology creates good outcomes, and our customers are happy. Here, I citeour 122% NRRR and our high LTV to CAC ratio. Third, and finally, we are more able to serve and sustain growth in the business than we were before,thanks to a higher profile and greater partner support. Due to these factors, we believe now is an opportune time for a reasonable level of additionalinvestment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for a deeper discussion of our financials. Mark?",False,True
1165,64389985,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call,Mark Lynch,Appian Corporation,"Thanks, Matt. This was another strong quarter for Appian. I'll review the financial highlights of the quarter and then provide details on our Q1 andfull year 2018 guidance.     invoiced on an annual upfront basis. However, we also have some large customers that are billed quarterly and others that are billed monthly. Assuch, we will continue to remind investors that changes in our deferred revenue are not always indicative of the momentum in the business. Backlog as of December 31, 2017, was $214 million compared with $167 million as of December 31, 2016. For the fourth quarter, we generated $1million in cash flow from operations. For 2017, we used $9.2 million in cash flow from operations as compared with $7.8 million used in the prioryear period. Now I will quickly recap full year 2017 results. Subscription revenue was $82.8 million, representing growth of 38% year-over-year. Our totalsubscription software and support revenue for the year was $91.5 million. Professional services revenue for 2017 was $85.2 million, up 35% comparedto 2016. Total revenue for 2017 was $176.7 million, up 33% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss from operations for the year was $18.8 million compared witha loss of $11.4 million in 2016. Non-GAAP net loss was $17.3 million in 2017 or a loss of $0.30 per basic and diluted share compared to non-GAAP net loss of $12.3 million or a lossof $0.23 per basic and diluted share for 2016. This is based on 57 million and 52.4 million basic and diluted shares outstanding for 2017 and 2016,respectively. Now turning to guidance. First of all, I'd like to remind the listeners that we are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jobs Act. As a result,we have decided not to adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required forother public companies. In particular, we will defer adoption of the new revenue accounting standard topic 606 until January 1, 2019. In addition, we do not believe the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will have a material impact on Appian's financials as long asAppian continues to report tax losses domestically and internationally and maintains a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. For the full year 2018, subscription revenue is expected to be in the range of $106.5 million and $107.5 million, representing year-over-year growthof between 29% and 30%. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $198.1 million and $201.1 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations isexpected to be in the range of $39.9 million and $37.9 million with a non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.54 and $0.53. (sic-see press release ""$0.65and $0.62"") This assumes 61.1 million basic and diluted common shares outstanding. For the first quarter of 2018, subscription revenue is expected to be in the range of $24.4 million and $24.6 million, representing year-over-yeargrowth of 30% to 31%. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $46 million and $46.2 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expectedto be in the range of $10.9 million and $10.5 million with a non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.18 and $0.17. This assumes 60.6 million basic anddiluted common shares outstanding. Our guidance reflects our stated strategy to invest for growth, to capture the long-term opportunity and build on our momentum. Given our highgross margins and subscription revenue, along with our powerful LTV to CAC metrics, we think it makes sense to continue to invest in the business,to capture new consumers and capitalize on the big upsell opportunity. We'll now open up the line to your questions.",False,True

Was really happy to see the strong net new customer adds. It seemed like it grewover 40% in 2017. But in terms of at least relative to where our model was, didn't see a whole lot of upside in terms of subscription revenue guidance.So I just wanted to understand the dynamics there as it relates to guidance, whether it's some conservatism or you expect some of the contributionfrom these customers to flow through over a multiyear period.",True,False
1168,64389985,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call,Matthew W. Calkins,Appian Corporation,"I'll cut in on that, if you don't mind. First of all, thank you for highlighting what I think is one of the best stats to come out of this quarter, the netnew customer adds. I think that bodes really well for us going forward, and it's a highlight for me. I also love the fact that those net new customeradds came without dilution in quality. So we're still getting an excellent average customer value. And I believe that also reflects -- I mean, we'renot diluting it. We're just getting more of the same in terms of customer. So I think the potential of those is very high. That said, I don't want tomake any assumptions about how they're going to develop. Appian sales cycles tend to be long, and I want to be open-minded about how longit would take a customer to develop and move forward. I think it's a good indicator. But as we've said many times, Appian is aiming at 30% growth,and we are -- we plan to make estimates that are in line with that as we have. And so we're being careful about that, and we're delighted to seethe new wave of customers. But we're going to wait and see how it plays out.",True,False

And then a couple of things maybe on gross margins, particularly on the professional services side. They've held above 35% for most of theyear. I wanted to get your view on whether -- are those types of gross margin on the professional services side sustainable? And then the same sortof similar question on the retention rate, sort of hovering around that 120% range, which is kind of well above what you guys saw in 2016. And sowanted to get your view on the sustainability of those trends on those 2 metrics.",True,False
1170,64389985,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call,Matthew W. Calkins,Appian Corporation,"Great. Okay. I'll take that one also. The professional services margins, you're right. These have been really, really elite level margins, and we do notintend to maintain that level of margin. We've been pleased to see it come in, but it is not our business to maximize professional services profits.Our plan with regards to professional services is to be consultative and encourage success amongst our customers, not to make the last possibledollar out of those relationships. We have had traditionally high prices, and that was largely so that we could create a price vacuum under our pricepoint and encourage our partners to fill that vacuum and build healthy Appian-centric businesses. But with regards to the net market for Appian-centricservices, we plan and expect to continue to lose market share in that market. We don't want to sustain our place in it. And as we become smallerand more consultative, I expect those margins to drop. With regards to your second question, which was, can we sustain the 122% revenue retentionthat we reported this quarter, and I believe exactly the same thing last quarter? We are -- we like to estimate between 110% and 120% in net revenueretention. I'm delighted to see it higher. I think it makes a really good statement about the experience that our customers are getting. And you bet,we're asking for a lot. We ask professional services to deliver a lot in terms of happy customers and revenue retention, but we're comfortableestimating that 110% to 120% is where this business belongs.",True,False
1171,64389985,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call,Sanjit Kumar Singh,"Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then my last question in terms of the margin guidance. It looks like we're going to see an accelerated pace of investments going intonext year. In terms of where we're going to see that investment within sales and marketing, is that hiring quota-carrying reps to the sort of samelevel you saw last year in 2017 -- and we think about the mix between domestic and international, any sort of color you can provide on that in termsof where these investments are going?",True,False
1172,64389985,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call,Matthew W. Calkins,Appian Corporation,"Yes, that's right. Okay, we're absolutely going to hire quota-carrying reps with some of that additional investment. And that, of course, drives a lotof the company investment. You bring on a rep, then you got to staff them with BDRs and solutions consultants and appropriate marketing andlead gen. And so you make your decision about adding new reps and then you kind of bring the entourage behind it. So that's driving a lot of thestructure around the spend. It will be largely sales and marketing spend, I can tell you that. And we will not neglect the growth in Europe. It's oneof our top growth areas in 2017. As we mentioned, the 91% subscription revenue was particularly impressive, and we want to feed that strengththat we're seeing in Europe.",True,False
1173,64389985,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call,Mark Lynch,Appian Corporation,"And I think from the spend, we will continue to invest heavily in the R&D function as well because that's incredibly important for us, to stay basicallycreating -- basically improving the simplicity of the platform and making it easier to deploy throughout our customer base.",True,False

It seems to me that, I don't know if it was post-IPO, that you see something in the market that kind of triggeredthat you want to be more aggressive. Can you just talk a little bit about kind of what changed over the last few months that kind of drove thisdecision to kind of say, look, actually I don't want to wait. I don't want to be that measured. I just -- kind of I need to go now.",True,False

I don't want to characterize our response as unmeasured, Raimo. But I will say, there are certainly triggers that welook at to justify an incrementally larger spend footprint. I think the subs revenue being 38% growing year-over-year, that growth rate was certainlya trigger that said, this deserves some additional investment. The NRRR meant a lot to me. That being on the high end of our range and steady at122%. I think the LTV to CAC indicates a lot of strength and that, that warrants a follow-up investment. And I also believe that as a company, we'remore able to handle spending more money this year than we were a year ago with the stature or the profile we have coming out of the IPO, withthe far greater partner support than we had. And that support is so necessary. If we're going to scale up quickly and staff clients to success, I neededthat to be there. We need that to be there.

1177,64389985,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call,Raimo Lenschow,"Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division","And then on that note, like a couple of quarters ago, there was a little bit of a debate.

1178,64389985,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Appian Corp Earnings Call,Matthew W. Calkins,Appian Corporation,"That's right. I still prefer an all of the above strategy, which is to say that what we're offering is a little bit divergent from the expectations that anymarket label carries but that we can fulfill the expectations of many markets. And that we hope we are seen in greater fidelity as we go forwardand that a market definition begins to coalesce around exactly what we're offering, which is a great, easy way to build unique software. You don'texactly feel that when you hear about low-code. Low-code gives you the simplicity side but not the power. And you don't feel that in other definitions     either, like case management, BPM, high productivity application platform as a service and a few other tongue-twisters. None of them convey thetotality of what Appian is offering which, in short, is a combination between simplicity and speed and power of application. Nobody is really hittingthat sweet spot, but I do believe that the message is getting out, and it may be getting out most effectively through examples of Appian's successrather than through redefined market parameters. Suffice it to say, the market is still indistinct in many ways, and we are exceeding the expectationsof clients who approach us under any one of those market labels.

As you think about the European roll out -- or like if you think about how you expand in Europe,can you talk a little bit how you do that?

Our first and largest office in Europe is in London, and we have branched out fromthere. However, as we've matured, we've refined the strategy, the doctrine by which we enter new countries. Whereas in the past, it might havebeen you drop a sales rep in there and hope that a year or 2 from now, they've got a referenceable customer, and then you hope that customerconvinces some partners to train resources. And then you have a viable combination of reputation, resources and presence. We don't do thatanymore. Our new doctrine says that when you go into a new office, new country, you go in with a minimum viable team, which is to say you needreps; consultants; adequate support, generally from partners; references, publicity; in-language marketing.

And I mean that on the technological stack and also on the stack that has a person at the top.So I'm less thinking, say, that AI is going to write your next application and more thinking that AI will provide critical support in interpreting,evaluating, quantifying, recognizing, right? These are things that AI is really well-suited for. Someday, someday, maybe AI will do everything forus. But right now, I believe it's going to master the bottom of the stack first, and we are approaching the AI opportunity that way.",True,False

Yes, and I tend to agree with sort of the here's a recommendation as opposed to rewriting things, true. I guess something a little moretactical from my perspective. You've talked about some of these really nice expansions at customers, and it's coupled with sort of partners too. Butas you think about it, I'd love to understand how, a little more tactically, a partner gets involved, develops the first application -- or sorry, a customergets involved, develops the first application and they roll it out. And there's great acceptance and it is much more efficient and it is quick. And yourteam was involved, and maybe your partner was involved, but obviously, the customer was involved. When they get to the second applicationthey think they can roll out, what percentage is that sort of the customer's people doing it now that they've got comfortable and they're trained?And then by the third or fourth, sort of what is that linearity of sort of the customer owning the idea and owning the process to automate theselegacy systems and applications using Appian sort of play out?

I'd like to hand off the services to the customer or to a partner, as per the customer's preference, asearly as possible in the life cycle, provided that we in no way threaten the success of our value proposition on-site. That's my goal. So we train. Wetransition. We bring partners on to our original deal team, so that the transition will be easier, and we can move on. We have redirected the servicesteam this year, explicitly in bonuses everywhere from the top-down. We have redirected the team to care more about customer success and netrevenue retention than we care about billable hours or service revenue. So we're serious about not treating customers as a cash cow but insteadbeing enablers to their success. That is our goal with services.

Have you seen customers sort of say, hey, we love the technology,thanks for the tech, but we don't need your folks. We don't need your partner's folks because we got this.

I remember customers occasionally saying, if we need youfor services, then we don't want you for software, right? So some customers are very bold about this whether because they've got internal confidenceor they insist on simplicity. There are reasons why the number of applications that we service is zero, sometimes. Every -- as we go forward in anaccount, we're doing less and less, percentage-wise, with services. As I said, we're also intending to lose market share, and we are losing marketshare in the Appian-related services category overall.

One, you mentioned, pharmaco -- I can't pronounce it, there's too many syllables, but the pharmacovigilance, whatever, is that competitiveat all to Veeva?

It's going to take them 3 years, and they don't have all the people to do it.So that's our first incumbent.

We think about whether we're adding value on site, whether we're accelerating the ability tomake new applications, whether those applications are powerful, whether they're secure and usable and easy and walk-up valuable. That's allextremely important to us, and we spend a great deal of time honing the value proposition compared with really almost no time at all thinkingabout what our competitors are doing or whether we can match them in some way. We know that this is a wide open market. We know that our-- Appian and its competitors offer fundamentally different roots and different value proposition.

But in '19, I assume that you hopeand intend that to be accretive. I mean, do you guys run numbers and go, okay, if we spend $10 million, that will get us $20 million in '19?

In the case ofthe net adds, I mean, it really is a big step up. And part of it's definitely explained, Matt, by the partners driving over 30 deals, which is powerful.But just from an expectation standpoint, I know you're not guiding to net adds for '18, but with these partners still in the earlier stages, could wetheoretically continue to see tremendous growth in customer acquisition in '18 even before these investments that Richard had asked about, andyou talked about, even bear fruit.",True,False

I think our profile rising had something to do with it, maybea little. We did very well with partners. So you're spot on about that. Europe produced more net adds than the whole company did a year prior.And then I also think that our message met the market very well this year, which is to say, we were selling something that people wanted to buy.It was digital transformation. It was an easier way to build applications. That was a good message, and so it helped us. All these things helped us.And the simplicity of that message helped us. It was an easier thing for a new customer to digest and approve. I believe a lot of these factors willcontinue to help us in similar ways. And I believe we're going to have a good year in terms of net customer adds. We don't guide to it, and I don'twant to. And I do want to be careful to suggest that -- or I want to be careful not to suggest that I think another tripling is in the works.

I believe services is a verygood indicator. When it does pop up like this, it means great things for the business even though we're trying to transition to partners. It meansthat we got a lot of new logos, and it means that we're getting ready to get some good follow-on sales. Those are the 2 things that I see when I seemore services dollars for Appian.

We analyze our revenues, again, based upon network type, which is on-net, off-net and noncore. And we also analyze our revenues based uponcustomer type. And we classify all of our customers into 2 types, either NetCentric customers or Corporate customers. Our NetCentric customersbuy large amounts of bandwidth from us in carrier neutral data centers and our Corporate customers buy bandwidth from us in large multitenantoffice buildings. Revenue from our Corporate customers grew sequentially by 2.9% to $78.7 million and year-over-year grew by 11.7%. We had 38,006 Corporatecustomer connections on our network at quarter end. Quarterly revenue from our NetCentric customers grew sequentially by 0.1% and year-over-yeargrew by 3.1%. We had 33,607 NetCentric customer connections on our network at quarter end. Our NetCentric revenue growth experiences morevolatility than our Corporate revenue growth due to the impact of foreign exchange and other seasonal factors. Revenue and customer connections by network type. Our on-net revenue was $89.4 million for the quarter, which was a sequential quarterlyincrease of 1.7% and a year-over-year increase of 7%.

The average price per megabit for our installed base declined sequentially by 8.7% from last quarter to $0.99and declined by 21.1% from the fourth quarter of last year. The average price per megabit for our new customer contracts declined sequentiallyby 22.9% to $0.42, as we sold to larger customers compared to last quarter, and declined by 42.1% from our new customer contracts that weresold in the fourth quarter of last year. Comments on ARPU, which decreased sequentially. Our on-net ARPU, which includes both Corporate and NetCentric customers, was $494 for thequarter, which was a sequential decrease of 1.7%. Our off-net ARPU, which is comprised predominantly of corporate customers, was $1,208 for thequarter, which was a sequential decrease of 0.9%. Churn rates were stable during the quarter. Our on-net churn rate was 1.1% this quarter comparedto 1% last quarter. And our off-net churn rate was 1.2% this quarter compared to 1.1% last quarter. On [move back] change orders. We offer discounts related to contract term to all of our Corporate and NetCentric customers. We also offer volumecommitment discounts to our NetCentric customers.

We operate 53 Cogent-controlled data centers, with a grand total of 603,000 square feet of raised-floor space. We are todayoperating those facilities at approximately 31% utilization rate. Our sales rep turnover rate was 3.5% for the quarter, significantly below our long-term average of rep turnover of 5.8%. We ended the quarter with455 sales reps selling our service. This is the greatest number of quota-bearing reps in the company's history. Cogent is the low-cost provider of internet access transit services and VPN services and our value proposition remains unparalleled in the industry.Our business remains completely focused on internet IP connectivity and data center colocation services. What we are providing is a utility to ourcustomers and they recognize the value that we deliver. We expect our annualized constant currency long-term revenue growth rates to be withinour historical norms of 10% to 20% top line and we expect our long-term EBITDA as adjusted margins on an annual basis to increase by approximately200 basis points. Our board of directors approved yet another increase to our regular quarterly dividend, increasing that dividend by $0.02 per quarter per share,to $0.50 per share per quarter. Our dividend increases recognize the continued optimism we have in the cash flow generating capabilities of ourbusiness. Increasing the dividend and continued delevering is a sign of the strength in our business. We are optimistic about utilizing our buyback authorization and we'll try to take advantage of opportunistic situations to deploy the $41.5 millionremaining under our current buyback authorization, which continues through December of this year. We are committed to returning an ever-increasingamount of capital to shareholders on a regular basis.     With that, I'd like to open the floor for questions.",False,True

One, Dave, on revenue growth, so constant currency growth this quarter was about 6.6%. It's the lowest we've seen in some time.Just wondering -- is this a little bit more of a newer reality at least in the interim? And then more specifically, what are the kind of catalysts do youexpect that help NetCentric growth reaccelerate? Because I think that's been the one piece of the business that the revenue growth has beensomewhat lagging. And then, secondly, just in terms of tax reform, wondering how that changes the company's outlook as it relates to bothinvestments in CapEx as well as capital allocation and shareholder returns.",True,False
1233,64389602,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,David Schaeffer,"Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.","Thanks for the questions, Matt. So while our year-over-year quarterly constant currency growth rate was low, our constant currency sequentialgrowth rate in the fourth quarter was the best of the year, at 1.8%. We also do anticipate on a constant currency basis our growth rate to continueto improve, both on a sequential basis and on a year-over-year basis. I think the year-over-year fourth quarter was specifically distorted by somestrong growth in the fourth quarter last year that we didn't have from several very large customers. We do expect our NetCentric growth to improvefrom the 3.1% year-over-year growth rate that we delivered this year, which is substantially below our long-term average of 10% NetCentric growthrate. We are continuing to see a improvement in our traffic growth rates. So our sequential growth rate improved on a quarterly basis from 8% theprevious quarter to 12%. Even accounting for seasonality, our year-over-year growth rate continued to improve and improved throughout the yearand ended up at 29%. That is still below our long-term average, but we are seeing consistent improvement as the negative impacts of violationsof net neutrality continue to fade. We see new customer business models. We see existing customers taking more traffic. And we do feel that ourNetCentric business will continue to improve, albeit at a slow pace, but consistently improve, while our Corporate business continues to performalong historical trends and, quite honestly, quite consistent and quite well. The growth of 2.9% sequentially in that business and 11.7% year-over-yeardemonstrates the durability and consistency in that business. Now with regard to tax reform, clearly it had an impact on our reported EPS due tothe reversal of the tax reserve that we had taken adjustment for. Secondly, the tax act does, I think, institutionalize for 4 years bonus depreciationthrough 2022. That will most likely push out when Cogent will be a tax cash payer by about 3 years. We were initially anticipating having to makestructural changes to avoid cash taxes by mid-'19. Now I think that's more like mid-2022. We are still considering corporate structures and otherchanges to our tax policies to further minimize long-term taxes. Now with regard to capital expenditures, Cogent expends capital based on theexpected rate of return. We have excess capital on our balance sheet, and yet we continue to moderate our capital spending. Our CapEx as measuredby CapEx and principal payments on capital leases declined, albeit modestly, from $57.7 million to $57.0 million on a year-over-year basis. Weexpect those declines in absolute terms to continue going forward. Clearly, as a percentage of revenue the declines are more pronounced as wecontinue to grow top line. We do not see bonus depreciation or any other changes in tax policy having us accelerate our capital spending, becausewe don't think there are building opportunities to connect to that would generate sufficient returns. And we remain disciplined about our footprintexpansion.",True,False

1235,64389602,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,Scott Goldman,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Dave, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the sales force expansion plans for 2018. I think you've been growing the sales force probablyhigh single digits, almost double digits at various times. Wondering how much of your growth outlook is dependent upon further sales forceexpansions along the lines of what we've seen. And then secondly, Dave, you just mentioned sort of the tax reform not impacting the capitalspending side. But maybe you can just help us understand what the opportunity is in terms of adding buildings onto your network. It feels asthough over time you've sort of downplayed the multitenant office building opportunity, yet we continue to see that being almost an equal driveras data centers in terms of adding buildings onto the network.",True,False
1236,64389602,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,David Schaeffer,"Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.","Yes. Sure, Scott. So let me take each of those questions in order. We intend to grow our sales force between 7% and 10% for the year. We have asignificant addressable market opportunity and not enough sales people to cover that opportunity, both on-net and off-net. Our sales force isroughly 72% Corporate, about 28% NetCentric. We intend to grow both portions of the sales force to attack each of those markets. We think thatthe VPN migration away from MPLS to either VPLS or SD-WAN provides our Corporate reps with added addressable market opportunity. So as wethink about growing our business, we look at plenty of targets for us to sell to, a very predictable rate of price decline in the marketplace, bothCorporate and NetCentric after a number of years and a ability to continue to elevate our sales productivity. And the fact that we were able to gofrom 5.7 units installed to 5.8 and yet we had the most number of reps in the company's history, 455, the most number of full-time equivalent reps-- these are fully ramped reps -- of 429, our rep tenure continues to grow. So we will continue to invest in sales as the primary way to continue toaccelerate revenue growth. Now with regard to footprint expansion, we remain extremely disciplined about the type of buildings that we go into.Now we go into data centers as new data centers are being constructed. And there continues to be a significant amount of capital going into thedata center market that has had us continue to add to that footprint at the rate of about 65 to 70 facilities per year. We are in 800 data centerbuildings, with about 960 discrete data centers served. On the MTOB, or corporate multitenant office base, we continue to add about 60 a year.That has slightly decelerated. As we've seen the economy improve there has been some new construction of large buildings. Our average buildingsize remains consistent at about 550,000 square feet per building. In fact, if you do the arithmetic on the last quarter, the average building that weadded in the fourth quarter, MTOB, multitenant office building, was actually larger than the average. But we do have a very defined list of whichbuildings meet our criteria and we continue to go after those buildings, but we are not changing our criteria. We do not think the tax act has anyimpact on that decision because it's driven entirely by return on capital. And then with regard to the tax act and our ability to return capital toshareholders, dividends remained at the same tax rate. Corporate is lower but that has been not an important factor for Cogent. And we willcontinue to try to be thoughtful about returning capital as opposed to issuing taxable dividends and using buybacks when appropriate. So I thinkwhile the tax act is clearly a positive for business, it is not going to change the way we approach the market either to our customers or to ourshareholders.",True,False
1237,64389602,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,Scott Goldman,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. One quick follow-up on the tax act, are you seeing -- understood in terms of what the impact is for you guys. Are you seeing any impact interms of the demand equation from your customers? Does it change -- help drive traffic acceleration now that maybe they're keeping a little bitmore in their coffers?",True,False
1238,64389602,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,David Schaeffer,"Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.","I don't think so, Scott. I mean, the drivers for internet traffic growth and corporate customers needing the internet are much more profound andsubstantive than tax. The internet is a necessary utility to all of our customers. And what is driving their need for more bandwidth and moreconnectivity are their business applications, not their tax decisions. On the Corporate side, we are seeing an accelerated pace of MPLS VPNreplacement with various over-the-top strategies that I think will provide significant tailwind to the Corporate business. On the NetCentric side, asthe noise of net neutrality dies down and all of the last mile networks that had previously decided to block traffic are now freely upgrading theirports, we continue to see our NetCentric customers roll out new businesses, new applications. And the internet traffic growth is beginning to     rebound for the whole industry, and clearly for Cogent it's rebounded. So while we grew 29% year-over-year, the industry is only growing at about20%. So we're not at that 27%, 28% industry growth rate yet and we're not at the high 40s average Cogent growth rate.",True,False

1240,64389602,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,Colby Alexander Synesael,"Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, if I may. First off, on CapEx, I've had the opportunity to cover Cogent for quite some time now. And I think if I go back a few years,at this point we're expecting CapEx to be -- and that includes cap leases -- to be in the low to mid-40s with a target of actually I think getting intothe high 30s at some point. Yet we're still at around that $57 million number that you referenced earlier. What's changed versus maybe expectationsa few years ago? And do you think that those lower numbers are still realistic? And then secondly, on growth specifically within the NetCentricbusiness and the 6.6% that was mentioned this quarter, you keep on mentioning net neutrality as one of the issues that is hindering growth. ButI have another thought that I wanted to suggest or get out there and see what you think. We've seen these hyperscale companies shifting a lot oftheir traffic needs out to an on-net, so buy more dark fiber, buy more wave lengths. And it seems like that's coming at the expense of IP transit,somewhat similar to how at one point they used to be big purchasers of CEN services and they brought that in house. Do you think that that's atrend that you're seeing impact your business and traffic growth? And could that also be part of the reason for why the traffic has slowed?",True,False
1241,64389602,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,David Schaeffer,"Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.","Yes, sure, Colby. Let me take both questions. First of all, on the CapEx question, our long-term CapEx guidance is that as methodically our capitallease and CapEx number will approach about $35 million. Clearly, $57 million is above that and the rate of decline has been slower. Now what hasprobably been a bit surprising over the past few years has been 2 things. One, the amount of data center footprint that Cogent has added to itsfootprint, Cogent-owned data centers; and then secondly, the accelerated rate at which new third-party carrier neutral data centers are being builtas measured by either square footage or megawatts of power. And because of that we are extending our network more aggressively. We have alsoextended our network to some new markets that were not initially contemplated, some of the Asia markets such as Singapore, Tokyo and HongKong. We do continue to evaluate other areas of the world and possibly could grow to those areas. But we do expect our absolute CapEx that isCapEx and principal payments on capital leases, to continue to decline, albeit at a slower rate of decline than we had expected. Now to the NetCentricgrowth rates. First of all, it is absolutely true that larger hyperscale companies -- and Cogent serves virtually every one of them -- have their ownproprietary data center footprint and they have built networks to connect those data centers to one another and to connect those networks tomajor exchange points. However, those companies continue to use transit services to connect to the internet. They have a discrete waterfall thatthey look to migrate traffic off of their networks. First and foremost, they seek settlement-free peering agreements. If anyone will give them freeconnectivity they will take it. And clearly that's a competitive offer that Cogent cannot, or does not want, to compete with. Secondly, they will usepaid direct connections. Those connections are typically more expensive than the market price for transit. And they will only use those if they areforced to under contract or if they feel that the underlying interconnections are at risk from their transit providers. Those fears are going away. Andthen, finally, transit, which is the easiest to use and most ubiquitous service with the lowest cost point, continues to be used by all of the hyperscaleplayers. In fact, we saw our traffic growth accelerate on a year-over-year and sequential basis. If your thesis was correct we would not see that. Nowthere is traffic that previously existed on the internet that no longer exists on the internet through direct connections. We've seen, for example,some of the over-the-top video providers take their traffic and no longer treat it as internet traffic, but rather as a channel on a linear closed cablesystem. That traffic disappeared from the internet. It is no longer over-the-top traffic and it is now being delivered on a closed network. That trendwill probably continue for some of the largest providers. But the aggregate amount of internet traffic continues to grow and actually is now growingat an accelerating rate. And for that reason, we feel optimistic that our NetCentric business is going to continue to improve, albeit at a slower pacethan we would have hoped.",True,False

1243,64389602,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,Nicholas Ralph Del Deo,MoffettNathanson LLC,"First a capital structure one. So Dave, you've always described taking on debt as -- I think you've used the term renting cheap capital rather than amore permanent decision. Rates remain pretty low by historical standards. But what would we have to see for your calculus regarding the appropriatecapital structure for the business start to change?",True,False
1244,64389602,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,David Schaeffer,"Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.","Yes, fair enough. And I do view debt as temporary, not permanent capital; equity as permanent capital. And at Cogent, we have the luxury ofbuilding our business without debt and then taking on debt to accelerate returns of capital to our stakeholders, and, quite honestly, suffered somenegative carry by carrying excess cash on our balance sheet, such as the $247 million that we currently have. Our debt is fixed term debt withmaturities in '21 and '22. Our debt also is trading above par. So therefore, the market is still pricing our debt below our coupon for that debt. Interestrates have risen. We are probably in a short-term period of increased rates. Maybe this is my personal opinion, but I believe that the rate increaseswill be more benign than people think and maybe more short-lived. The underlying growth rates are still somewhat muted for the economy andinterest rates around the world remain extremely low. Of all those reasons, we will keep the debt structure that we currently have in place throughthose maturities. We may opportunistically look at extending maturities and/or increasing debt if it was cost effective. Today it is probably not.And we maintain the flexibility to actually pay off our debt if rates do materially increase. And you can see that with the substantial improvementin both our gross leverage and net leverage numbers. Our gross leverage improved sequentially from 4.57 to 4.44. That's a fairly material improvementin a given quarter. Our net debt improved from 3.00 to 2.94, again sequentially, again, a pretty significant improvement in a single quarter. Andwe expect those trends to continue for the next several quarters even with our increased dividend commitment.",True,False
1245,64389602,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,Nicholas Ralph Del Deo,MoffettNathanson LLC,All right. That's helpful. And then maybe one on the cost side. You run a pretty lean operation. Are there [any] cost savings opportunities out therelike real estate rationalization or consolidating cross connects or automation that you might be able to take advantage of going forward or thathave been helping results as of late?,True,False
1246,64389602,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,David Schaeffer,"Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.","So I think the answer is yes to all of the above. I appreciate the compliment that we run a lean operation. We try to be cost-effective. You saw amaterial improvement on a sequential and year-over-year basis both in gross margin and in our SG&A efficiency, resulting in our operating leverage.Some comes from revenue growth. Some comes from continued real estate and other operational cost savings. We constantly evaluate our facilities,figure out if we can lower their costs. On cross connects, we've continued to migrate away from 10 GB cross connects for customers or peers thathave a large amount of traffic, to 100 GB. That grooming process is a significant savings. And then in terms of automation, our primary business isdelivering Internet, not developing new IS systems. However, we do have internal process improvement teams. We do consistently do more withless. And if you look at our headcount increases, almost all of our headcount, over 90% of the increase in employment at Cogent over the past yearcame in the sales organization, with less than 10% of our aggregate increase in headcount coming in operations. That is indicating that while ourrevenues grew at 8.6% and our traffic grew at 29%, the people that are actually producing the bit miles are becoming increasingly efficient.

So clearly we need to be paranoid. Any business is at risk, and we cannot be complacent about ourimprovement in performance or even in our current performance. We have 15 years of experience. We have relationships with over 6,120 transitpurchasing networks. That is more than anyone else in the world. We monitor our customers' traffic literally on a daily basis and see changes intheir traffic patterns, both in terms of volume and destination or source, depending on whether it's an access network or a content-producingcustomer. And we are encouraged by the continued, albeit slower, improvement in aggregate internet traffic growth and our growth. We do notgenerate the demand for internet traffic. Those are end users doing that. The death of the internet has been predicted many times. Colby alludedto it with hyperscale carriers building their own networks. I've heard cross connects are going to put us out of business. CDNs are going to put usout of business. Extended peering exchanges are going to replace transit. Transit continues to dominate the market because it is the easiest to use,most ubiquitous and, most importantly, lowest cost way for anyone who has a large amount of content or needs to access a large amount ofcontent to get that content moved. Those trends are going to continue. Our NetCentric business and the growth in that business is dependent on3 very simple principles. One, is the market going to continue to grow? Two, is Cogent going to be able to continue to win new customers? And ifyou look at just the number of ASs connected in the progression in that path, it's been pretty consistent and improving and we continue to dothat. And then third, will we get a larger share of the wallet from those customers? And you actually saw some indication of that even this quarter.Now it's a negative indicator in the sense that our rate of sequential new-sale decline was greater than it had normally been, being that largecustomers were buying more of the traffic than small customers. There's a lot of dynamism in the NetCentric market. But we continue to grow andwe capture market share. And I feel very comfortable that we're going to see continued improvement. And again, the 3.1% year-over-year growthis low by our historic standards, but it's still better than the 0% growth or even negative growth that we were experiencing at the height of portcongestion.

If you continue on these trends, it looks like you're going to head down to below 2.5x debt to EBITDA next year. Isthat what you're kind of saying, that you're okay to let that happen?

With regard to our interest rates, remember, part of our interest rate is driven by our capital lease imputed interest, which we haveno control over. That is really the capital lease issuer's decision and based on the market points when we took on that debt through the capitalleases. With regard to the, I would call it more discretionary debt, our 2 high-yield instruments, the coupons are 5 3/8% and 5 3/8%. Both are tradingabove par. And I think the current mark-to-market on those is about 4.2 for the secured debt and about 4.5 for the unsecured debt.

And then on the data center utilization, fairly low relative to some of the public guys. What do youthink you could do to maybe to get some better utilization in those data centers? Or is that calculated sort of excluding some of the space you usefor yourself? Or how should we think about that?",True,False
1260,64389602,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc Earnings Call,David Schaeffer,"Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.","Okay. So the calculation is what is net rentable. It does not include Cogent utilization within the centers for our equipment. Two, we did see a slightuptick from 30% to 31% sequentially in the quarter in terms of utilization. And we did not add any new data center footprint. We also have about18 months ago implemented a data center certification program for our sales force. If a rep goes through that additional training and passes it,they actually get some additional compensation on data center sales, which has helped us sell additional rack and power in our footprint. Our datacenters are relatively low power density. So it is probably not totally fair for us to compare them to some of the other operators. We have about 70megawatts across our footprint or about 125 watts per square foot as opposed to most public operators at about 250 watts per square foot. Sothere are some structural differences. But there are many customers, mostly corporate, who our data center is a very good footprint and fit for, andwe expect to see that continue to grow.

As I look back at 2017, despite operating in an extremely challenging environment in the first half of the year, we madesignificant and substantial strides that will solidify our position in the vehicle rental and mobility industry, enabling us to provide better productsand services to our customers, while also increasing shareholder value. Steps such as, significantly increasing our fleet of connected cars; launchingthe industry's first mobility lab; partnering with Waymo to support its fleet of autonomous vehicles; launching our fully integrated Demand FleetPricing system; making strategic investments in our business that will lower our costs and further our leading position in the rapidly changingmobility landscape; and generating $354 million of adjusted free cash flow; and repurchasing $200 million of our own shares. And we ended theyear on a very positive note. We had a strong fourth quarter driven by good global volume growth, increased pricing, including our secondconsecutive quarter of positive pricing in the Americas and stable fleet costs. Our emphasis on driving manpower and shuttling efficiencies continuedto yield positive results and our commitment to cost management was also effective in the quarter with our adjusted EBITDA margin improvingyear-over-year.

1268,64388164,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Avis Budget Group Inc Earnings Call,Martyn Smith,"Avis Budget Group, Inc.","Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I'm now going to discuss our fourth quarter results together with our fleet, cash flow, liquidity andoutlook for the full year, together with an update on the effects of U.S. tax reform and of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. Mycomments will largely focus on our adjusted results, which, as Neal mentioned, are reconciled from our GAAP numbers both in our press releaseand earnings call presentation. Firstly, starting with an overview of our fourth quarter. Strong volume growth and positive pricing led to total company revenue increasing by 7%.Fleet costs in the Americas were unchanged year-on-year, a significant improvement to the first half, while International fleet costs were 5% lowerin local currency. This, in conjunction with our cost mitigating actions and the $5 million benefit from foreign exchange, led to a 16% improvementin our adjusted EBITDA to $140 million for the quarter with a 50 basis point improvement in margin. For the whole of 2017, we increased total company revenue by 2% to $8.8 billion, driven by strong 5% volume growth and 2% lower local currencypricing. Company-wide per-unit fleet costs increased by 3% in local currency, partially offset by the cost mitigating actions implemented throughoutthe year. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA was $735 million. Now to go into further detail on the results, starting first with the Americas. Our focus on driving the most profitable transactions through improvedchannel and customer mix were evident in this quarter. Leisure volume and pricing each increased 5%, achieving a particularly strong Christmasseason. Commercial volume and pricing were both unchanged in the quarter, the second consecutive quarter of flat rate per day, as we focusedon the most profitable commercial customers. This performance resulted in a 3% improvement on Americas revenue for the quarter, with overallpricing increasing by more than 2% in local currency. Across all of 2017, we grew Americas volume by 2%, while pricing was 1% lower, but rate perday improving in the second half of the year. Now turning to Americas costs, particularly fleet. Per-unit fleet costs increased 6% for the full year, but were flat in quarter 4 with used car pricescontinuing their recovery from the first half of 2017, helped by small benefit from post-hurricane effects, and, and you will hear more in detailshortly, a great performance in alternative disposition channels. Despite a difficult start to the year and hurricane-related disruptions, utilizationstill improved by 13 basis points in 2017. With our strategy to keep our fleet tight relative to demand, we plan to further improve utilization thisyear, assisted by the approach to our model year '18 buy, where we consciously contracted for fewer vehicles compared to model year '17. Wecontinue to see benefits from our strategic initiative to sell more of our risk fleet through alternative disposition channels. In the quarter, alternativechannels accounted for 54% of our risk car sales compared to 42% in the prior year. For the full year, 50% of our risk cars were sold outside oftraditional auction channels compared to 37% in 2016, and we have plans in place to further increase that percentage again in 2018.     With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",False,True

Is there a way to parse that out if you can? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director Well, what I'd say is that we've been working really hard on the commercial side of the business to really start targeting segments of the businessthat produced a higher rate per day. So we've been really zoning in on our mid-market accounts and our small business accounts to try to bringmore higher-rated per-day business into the segment. You couple that with we had just a really robust Thanksgiving and Christmas season. A very,very strong robust Christmas season. And I think also DFP, the Demand Fleet Pricing system, continues to yield benefit for us when we get intothose really peak periods where we're able to really yield our pricing up and that's what it was really designed to help us do.

How do you generically see that unfolding over the next several years? Is there -- is '18 a much bigger year than '17? Or is '19 more -- I'm justcurious as to your thoughts as to how maybe your involvement evolves over time. Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director Well, definitely we'll continue to expand our operations with Waymo as they continue to expand and add thousands of new cars to their program.We are talking to other mobility solution providers as far as how we might be able to partner with them and I think we'll start to see some of thoseunfold as well over '18 and into '19. And then I think as you look at our connected car initiative and the opportunities to partner with people as weexpand our connected car program into more fleet, it is definitely a longer-term approach to how we can drive more efficiencies into the businessand drive revenue opportunities through partnerships, through connectivity, as well as the service improvements that we can offer our customersas well. So I think there is a number of steps that will unfold over a number of years. And I think you'll continue to see us move down the mobilitypath each year, year-after-year, as it continues to grow as an important part of how we're going to develop our business over time.",True,False

Have you seen that momentum that you saw on the leisure side in the fourth quarter continue on? Orhave you seen any sort of breakage there? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director Well, we're not really commenting on what actual pricing has been going on in the quarter. What I would say is that a couple of things. One is thatthe dynamic -- the industry are what you would normally expect in the first quarter. The times of the week and the weeks of the quarter that youwould expect for the industry to be tight on fleet, the industry has been, and on the times of the quarter where you would expect it not to be, ithasn't been. The first quarter is more of a commercial quarter. There's not much activity other than the spring break, but they don't drive the volumeof business that causes the industry to really run out of cars, as like Thanksgiving and like Christmas does. So the first quarter is typically a morecommercial quarter. So you're not going to find as many opportunities for things like DFP to work and really be able to yield up your pricing. Butwhat I would say is that the first quarter is not at all like we've been experiencing in the last few years. It's back to what you would normally expectfirst quarter fleet to be behaving like. And with the Easter kind of the 1st of April, you might get a couple days of benefits in the end of March. Butthere's just not a lot of peak activity happening in the first quarter.",True,False

And then I wanted to ask just a little bit about fleet interest cost. I've gotten a lot of questions about how you guys may be impactedby rising rates and the amount of maturities that you have on the fleet size coming up the next couple of years. When you guys look at the piecesof debt that will fall off, say in '18 and '19, and what you might be able to replace those pieces at, how do you see fleet interest expense trendingmaybe over the next 2 to 3 years given the current rate environment that we are in today?",True,False

So I called out a likely extra cost in 2018 of about $20 million. That is simply the U.S. interest rate, or the point you're picking up onthe variable fleet debt. The Eurozone, we're expecting to be flat for 2018 and a little bit of pick up in Australia and New Zealand. But really, it's theU.S. story at the moment. And then probably 2019 onwards, further U.S. increases and then the Eurozone then picking up. So we've got about $1.5billion naturally coming off next year and then we're replacing. So our $20 million reflects essentially our anticipation of those maturities comethrough as the renewal as well. So there will be quite an increase progressively coming up over the next couple of years. But it's obviouslyindustry-wide, not just ourselves.",True,False

1277,64388164,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Avis Budget Group Inc Earnings Call,David J. Tamberrino,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Larry, I'm wondering how the industry-wide fleet is in the U.S. Looking at the fourth quarter, your fleet continued to grow in the same lines as wherevolume was, so utilization was flat. And I think from your comments, you planning to undergrow your expected volume increase for the year todrive utilization up. Curious to what you're seeing from a discipline standpoint from your major competitors. Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director Yes. Just first of all, about our fourth quarter fleet coming in at about flat on the utilization perspective. What really drove that -- I mean, our intentis to build a fleet to underdemand. We're going to continue to drive utilization, and we have that built into our plan for 2018. What happened reallyin the fourth quarter is when the hurricane -- the first hurricane hit, we actually pulled forward deliveries that were going to be delivered late inthe quarter, beginning of the first quarter this year, to help meet that demand of relief work demand, plus where we just thought fleets were goingto tighten up for insurance replacement business that other car rental companies might take. We pulled some fleet forward into the quarter. Andwhen the relief business didn't materialize, or at least didn't stay the length that we had plans for it and how it has really occurred in previoushurricanes as we discussed in the last quarter call, we had that fleet then in the quarter earlier and longer than we had really needed it. So the teamworked really hard as they went through the rest of the quarter to try to disperse that fleet, get it on rent and to delete fleet where possible, to getourselves back to kind of a flat position and also to be able to ensure that we have the right fleet for the opportunities for Thanksgiving andChristmas. So they did a really good job. Looking back now would we have pulled as many cars forward as we did? No. But we expected the reliefbusiness to be stronger and longer than it was. As far as the industry fleet levels, I would say, they were pretty typically normal. I think other peoplealso brought fleet forward, so the hurricane does kind of throw a little bit of difficulty into looking at the quarter. But once you get past that andyou just take a look at how the rest of the quarter unfolded and how we turned into the year, I would say fleet levels are back to what you wouldconsider a normal year and a normal turn into the new year.",True,False

And just a little bit in line of question earlier. I know you don't want to talk about what you're seeing so far for the first coupleof months. But it would seem as if the fourth quarter pretty strong from a pricing perspective, but your full year even when we adjust for theaccounting change still implies slightly down from what the 4Q '17 levels were. Is that just an abundance of caution? Or is that indicative of whatyou're seeing so far in the first quarter understanding it's seasonably weak? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director Well, I don't think you want to plan the full year pricing based on how you perform at Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we've had some difficultyears in pricing the last few years. And so we are looking at our year-over-year trends, we're looking at how we exited the year. We're taking all thatinto consideration. As we take -- we build our volume coming from the ground up. We don't just take the volume that we did last year and lap onan increase. We literally built it up account by account by account and our partnerships so forth and we get to where we really think our volumeis going to be. And so we -- the pricing reflects what we think will really happen as we transition out of what's been a very difficult period for thelast few years and some more normalized periods. And I hope we're wrong. I hope that pricing would be even stronger than that. We do have theloyalty impact that is impacting the year and will definitely impact more the first quarter the rest of the year. But no, I don't -- I wouldn't say it's aconservative approach. What I'm saying is that we just -- we need more than just at Thanksgiving and a Christmas to be more aggressive than whatwe're seeing.",True,False

Could you give us an update on what you're seeing in business travel and whether you believe tax reform couldlead to more of a pickup? And also, could you update us on your current market share in business travel? Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director Well, as I said earlier, we've been working really hard on trying to grow some of the other segments in the corporate channel business. The largecommercial accounts continue to be very competitive from everyone trying to win those accounts to the pricing that's offered in those accounts.We've -- we're not losing those accounts. We're hanging onto those accounts. We're hanging on to our share of those accounts. So we've beenreally focusing more of our attention on our mid-market and small business accounts, trying to win more of that business. It's a longer haul to dothat, but if we stay focused on it as we were all last year, we'll continue to drive more volume and commercial at a higher rate than what you'regoing to get with the large commercial accounts. And we're starting to see that pay off. As Martyn said, we've had kind of 2 months -- or 2 quartersin a row here where we've been able to improve -- keep our pricing flat on commercial and we've seen volume growth in the fourth quarter aswell, small volume uptake in the fourth quarter as well in the Commercial business. So that's far better than where we had been in the beginningpart of last year and the year before.

Or maybe you could frame how we should be thinking about that. Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director Well, I think it does because I think anytime that you kind of invest in airports and create a better environment for consumers to transit to the airportto create better facilities, better traffic flows, those all help the rental car industry. So we're a big component of the infrastructure bill.

I'm wondering if you could elaborate more on the International environment, what you're seeing from competitors andwhether you think fleet size is more rational now versus prior quarters. Larry D. De Shon - Avis Budget Group, Inc. - CEO, President & Director The pricing environment internationally continues to be really tough. We're -- we've been really fighting this fight now for the last couple of yearsand it doesn't really seems to be getting -- there doesn't seem to be strategic changes in the competition that's going to change anytime soon.That's why we're rolling out our pricing robotic and then eventually we'll get to the final phases of DFP there as well so that it can have the benefit,our International team can have the benefit of being able to forecast further out, be able to take advantage of more yielding opportunities, havethe confidence that fleet will tighten up in periods so that they can make decisions further out to drive more length of rental, improve their utilization.So those things are all actions that we're taking to improve pricing from our own perspective, but the industry dynamic really aren't changing. Weare seeing a growth of the third tier segment, providers allowed people getting into kind of the lower tier offering. It really started and kind ofworked to go in Spain and expanded into Italy and now starting to expand into some other countries as well. And that's something that we'regoing to need to contend with as far as how we compete in that the third tier. So yes, things are -- we're managing through it. And as we said, theyhad a really good year last year overall. But they did -- they weren't helped by pricing.

Within your expectation for total RPD flat, I think it's really more like up half a point to 2.5points x the headwind from the accounting change you mentioned. Could you just break out your underlying assumptions for core time andmileage versus ancillary? And I have asked this because, last year, on a total RPD basis, it was down roughly 2 points, ancillary down I think low-singledigits as well.

Our ancillary revenue has been underpressure. And as we've said, and we are working hard to kind of turn that around, we're pretty excited about what we're seeing online. Our onlineteam has been working really hard on how to present ancillary products in a more clear, concise and understandable way on the website so peoplewill really clearly understand what their options are. And also in the bundling initiative that we launched for the end of last year where we're puttingproducts together so it makes it easier for customers to be able to click on a bundled product.

When I talked about kind of back to normal, I really mean, I refer back a few yearsago prior to industry issues that some competitors had in the industry as far as over-fleeting or having the wrong mix, which has caused over-fleetingto occur. So we're kind of back to prior to those types of problems in the industry. I feel like we're kind of back to the period before that. Can theyalways get tighter? Sure. And I'm sure every rental car company is working on trying to find those times when they can have their cars during thevalleys as low as they possibly can and the cars during the peak as high as they possibly can to meet that peak. So through our fleet optimizationteam, through the data that we're now being able to integrate into the optimization models. We're just getting more and more sophisticated abouthow we buy our cars, using data and third party data to help us figure out how to buy our cars, when to buy our cars, where to infleet them andwhere to exit them at what -- kind of what stage of their lives to really maximize residual values, you can also be able to have the cars in the marketthat we need them at the time those market peak. As you can imagine, the markets we serve across the United States, that's a very complicatedmodel to work and our guys run these models every day, all day long, to make sure that we're constantly tweaking and changing our fleet to makesure that we try to drive that utilization benefit. We had flat utilization really for the year. And that was actually remarkable. When you think aboutus switching, transitioning in 2017 to go up 10 points in risk-cars over program car. What that means is that you have a lot fewer short-term carsthat you could turn back quickly to bring your fleet levels down and to be able to make that transition and be able to drive flat utilization whenthe majority -- when a much bigger part of your fleet is a longer-term fleet hold. We took a lot of effort by optimization teams and the guys in thefield to really be able to deliver on that. So we're kind of through that end point improvement transition and risk. And now we can go into nextyear with, I'd say we're going into '18 with a risk fleet that is similar to our '17 risk fleet. And that allows us to continue to find us opportunities totry to drive utilization up and the team is very focused on that in '18.",True,False

1297,64389939,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call,Guy J. Constant,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.","Thank you, Denny, and good afternoon, everyone. As I walk you through the highlights of our financial results for the fourth quarter, please notethat the numbers I present are on a recurring basis, excluding special items. As Denny outlined, the fourth quarter of 2017 extended Red Robin's run of significant traffic and sales outperformance versus the casual diningindustry, outperforming our peers by 360 basis points. We have also continued to expand on our 2-year outperformance versus our casual diningpeers, now tracking at 580 basis points as measured by Black Box. You may also recall that last quarter, we introduced that we have developed an additional benchmark that compares us to top quartile best-in-classcompetitors for the entire industry, not just casual dining. For Q4, we outperformed this group as well, generating a positive traffic gap of 100 basispoints. Congratulations to our operations, marketing and culinary teams for continuing to deliver significantly differentiated performance. However, as we have said for several quarters, relative outperformance is not enough. We strive to be a great business, not just a better restaurantbusiness. And the fourth quarter of 2017 demonstrated the start of the kind of results up and down the P&L that will help us deliver on that promise.As we have commented on in past quarters, a great deal of foundational work has been put in place over the past 2 years, and we are now seeingthe results from the differentiated thinking we brought to the industry and the hard work on those new ideas. For the full year 2017, Red Robin made notable progress in a number of areas. Our team members turned negative comp sales to positive. Ourteam members delivered full year positive traffic, one of only a very small number of restaurant industry players to do so. Our team membersreversed margin declines from earlier in the year to margin improvements at the end of the year. Our team members dramatically improvedrestaurant productivity and are poised to do so again in 2018. And our team members delivered the significant positive cash flow necessary for ahealthy and stable business. Yet to sustain the strong performance in the current casual dining environment, we need to introduce the type of changes necessary to make ourbusiness truly successful. We are making, and will continue to make, the important choices around business investments, and we will need toinnovate in a way that allows us to fully capitalize on the differentiated position that Red Robin holds with the restaurant consumer. These actions support our intention to first return to absolute and consistent earnings growth, and then put ourselves into a position to allow usto provide growth and returns that one associates with high-performing organizations. Now to the specific results, keeping in mind that in 2017, we featured a 53rd week versus 52 weeks in 2016. Q4 total company revenues increased17.5% to $342.4 million, up from $291.5 million a year ago, driven primarily by the 53rd week, strong comp sales and new restaurant openings.Comparable restaurant sales grew 2.7%, driven by a 1.9% increase in guest traffic and a 0.8% in average guest check. Mix decreased to 1.8%,primarily driven by heavier guest usage of our Tavern and Value menu. Overall price, after considering the impact of discounting, increased 2.6%in the quarter. This higher level of price was due to a change in timing for the price increases compared to a year ago as we took the price increasein October versus January. We would expect to be at our expected price level of 0% to 1% starting this quarter and moving forward, consistent with our focus on driving trafficthrough greater affordability for our guests. Fourth quarter restaurant level operating margin was 20.5%, up 70 basis points versus a year ago,driven by the following factors: Cost of sales increased 90 basis points to 23.7%, driven primarily by higher cost of steak fries and higher ground     Other operating expenses are expected to be flat to down 50 basis points, due primarily to lower repair and maintenance costs. Depreciationexpense is projected to be approximately $95 million. G&A expense is projected to be $85 million to $90 million. This includes a $3 million year-over-year increase to reset bonus to target levels. Inaddition, Denny mentioned earlier that we recently reset the organization to streamline our home office and field structure and free up resourcesstill out for reinvestment. About $10 million of those savings will be realized in the G&A line, offset partially by investment in the transformationaland technology projects that will lay the foundation for the future growth models for Red Robin. Selling expense, which includes both national and local marketing activities, is expected to be up slightly as a percent of restaurant revenues, andpreopening expense is estimated to be approximately $3 million due to fewer new restaurant openings. Our income tax rate is projected to rangebetween 0% and 5% for 2018. As Denny outlined, we expect to invest some of the tax savings in 2018 to accelerate initiatives to enhance the guestexperience, put technology in our team members' hands to improve their work experience and further improve productivity, and to identify thenext growth models for Red Robin as mentioned earlier. Earnings per diluted share is projected to range from $2.40 to $2.80 which represents an increase of 14% to 33% versus a year ago when normalizing2017 for the 53rd week. We expect Q1 earnings per diluted share between $0.60 and $0.80, reflecting both a challenging start to 2018 for theindustry and the loss of 1 high-volume revenue week versus a year ago due, again, to the 53rd week. Overall CapEx is projected to be between $65 million and $75 million as we shift capital investment from lower return new unit opening to higherreturn restaurant technology and kitchen investments that will increase revenue and improve productivity. We expect to open 3 to 5 new RedRobin restaurants in 2018, net of closures, and we expect to use excess free cash flow after CapEx to pay down outstanding debt. While we can look back on 2017 as a year of significant transition, what is most important was the work our team members did to put the companyin a position to both further improve our existing business and to aggressively and rapidly reinvent Red Robin for future growth. Our traffic numbersare at the top of the industry. Our NPS scores are reaching record levels. Our off-premise growth is exceeding our expectations. Our restaurantexecution is best-in-class. And we are making significant progress on a new and different service model for this space. Before I close, let me once again congratulate our operators and our marketing team for another quarter of differentiated performance. We'vetaken great care of our guests and our team members, and have, again, been good stewards of our company resources, all while absorbing significantchange to the service model. We will continue to prioritize our capital and operating investments based on the incremental returns on capital thatthese investments will create. Whether these priorities drive sales, improve margins, reduce expenses, generate EBITDA or distribute capital toshareholders, the overriding filter will be the expected return of that incremental capital or an improved return on capital already invested, as it isthe focus on overall returns that is most highly correlated to overall improvements in total shareholder return.

So what you had in the fourth quarter was the benefit of the pricing we took last January, plus what we took inOctober. That will correct itself here in Q1. We won't be taking price this January, we just took it early. And so we would expect our pricing to beflat to up 1% as a rule of thumb going forward. So we're definitely not pricing to try and offset the mix. In terms of the -- what we think about PPAand mix going forward, if the guests desire and the way we can drive value, as Denny said, is to allow the Tavern mix to extend, I think we're okaywith that. I think as we talked about, affordability and values are very important component for us. So we're not necessarily trying to push hard todrive our PPA higher. We want to make sure we maintain affordability for the guest.

First, it feels like the phrase, alternative service style, is new but it's not new. I understand you were looking at sort of differentways of growing the business. But I'm just curious if there's anything new in your thinking along those lines? I know you're testing a store, but itjust feels like you're looking at something new. And then the second question, more specifically, Guy, is the delta in returns from a low margin unitto high margin or a high return -- or a low return unit to a high return, other investments into improving your store performance? I'm just curiousof what the difference in the returns are, if you've seen those.",True,False
1335,64389939,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call,Denny Marie Post,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.","Yes, Howard. I mean, yes, alternative service models, and I put an S on the end of that, so I think what you're referring to is the 1 location that we'veopened that's currently just delivery and third-party carry-out or third-party delivery and self-delivery out of our Chicago location. We're continuingto look at ways that we can address the rising labor costs and find new ways in our existing 4-walls to help the guest. And so you'll hear a lot ofthat. That's what we consider transformation. And we've got a lot to focus on that right now, a number of different things we're looking at. But aswe bring those forward, expand them beyond very initial pilots, we'll share our results at that time.",True,False
1336,64389939,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc Earnings Call,Guy J. Constant,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.","Yes, and maybe just to add to that before I answer your other question, Howard, we were leaning heavily into the technology investment. We'rein the process of expanding the technology capacity in our current restaurants. We're doing an upgrade to our current point-of-sale software andour food cost management system. We're putting catering software in our restaurants. We're going to put technology in the hands of our serversto improve their productivity, improve the guest experience. So we feel like improving those 4-wall economics, which does lead into your secondquestion, is an important focus of ours. Rather than building new 4 walls, we need to make the 4 walls that we've got operate much better. In termsof the delta between returns, I mean, I don't know that I'd want to get into the specifics, but we've got units, as you might imagine, that do northof 6 million in volume on an annual basis and we've got some that do 2 million. And so as you can imagine, the return profile is dramatically differentbetween those 2. As we think about refranchising the system, those factors enter in to our equation as we think about would we earn a betterreturn with those models being franchised as opposed to being company-owned. Which is why we set the goals around increasing our franchisemix. And of course, any of these initiatives we're working on to drive comp sales or invest in technology and improve labor productivity will -- sortof will be the tide that lifts all the boats in the system. And so that's where we're focused on right now, improve the 4-wall economics. Doing better     with the investments that you've already made is always going to provide a better return than trying to search for new ideas to try and drive thosereturns as we move forward.",True,False

Delivery is definitely the growing category. Third-party delivery is huge and growing rapidly. And for the fact that it's only in about half ofour locations, it's over-representing right now in terms of growth. In terms of difference in check average, really not much difference in checkaverage.

1374,64389883,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call,John L. Plueger,Air Lease Corporation,"Thanks, Mary Liz. Good afternoon to all of you and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to report that Air Lease closed a strong quarter andanother successful year in 2017. Excluding the benefit of favorable tax reform, ALC achieved diluted earnings per share of $1.06 for the fourthquarter, up 19% from the same period of 2016, and ALC's diluted EPS was $3.65 for the full year, up 6% from the full year 2016. Including the positive impact of tax reform, for the fourth quarter, we're reporting diluted EPS of $4.22, including $3.16 per diluted share, due tothe remeasurement of our deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As a result of tax reform, ALC's effective tax rate will beapproximately 22% going forward, a decrease from our historical effective tax rate of 35.5%. This means that 38% more of ALC's pretax earningswill hit the bottom line, thereby building shareholder equity faster than previously planned. As we look around the marketplace, we see good opportunities to deploy this capital to generate strong returns for our shareholders, in line withour current returns. ALC achieved a number of milestones in 2017. To start, Air Lease now has exceeded $15 billion in total assets, up 12% from$14 billion in 2016, and up almost 70% in the past five years. Total revenues exceeded $1.5 billion for the first time in 2017, up 7% year-over-yearalone and up more than 75% over the past five years. Since inception, just eight years ago, our platform has grown to almost 300 aircraft owned and managed by ALC today. This growth has beenachieved with a focus on profitability and shareholder returns in mind, and without sacrifice to our profit margins. In fact, over the last four years,ALC has averaged an adjusted pretax margin of 42%. IATA reported just earlier this month that, in 2017, global passenger traffic rose 7.6% comparedto 2016, yet again, well above the 10-year average annual growth rate of 5.5%. Load factors were the record calendar year high of 81.4% in 2017.IATA forecasts passenger growth of 6% for 2018, again, above the average annual growth rate. This strong industry backdrop with growing levelsof passenger traffic and an ongoing need to replace aging aircraft has driven all around demand for ALC aircraft. Looking forward with a viewtowards our customers, IATA is projecting an overall growth in global airline profitability for 2018 with slight margin or yield compression forecastedfor the airlines. Despite this slight expected compression, we believe the industry continues to be in relatively good shape and envision no change in demandgoing forward. Over the fourth quarter, ALC delivered 12 aircraft, including eight new aircraft from our order book and four used aircraft purchased in the secondarymarkets. Included in our new aircraft deliveries was our first 737-8 Max to LOT Polish Airlines and A350-900 to Malaysia Airlines. The demand for new aircraft continues to drive our forward lease placements, which remain at a very robust, 97% through 2019 and now 79%through 2020. So, we are nearly done with placements through 2020. These placements, together with the aircraft we already have on lease, resultin ALC having over $23 billion in committed cash flows. We also profitably sold two aircraft in the fourth quarter, one to ALC's managed business,and one to an airline customer. We see continued demand for the used aircraft in our fleet.     As many of you are aware, over the last three years, ALC sold $2.8 billion worth of aircraft, and as a result, only 10% of our current fleet is comprisedof aircraft over eight years of age, which means we now have fewer candidates for sale. So in 2018, we remain opportunistic as it relates to potentialsales, as we always do, but sitting here today, I can tell you that we anticipate no aircraft sales in the first half of 2018. As to our sidecar platforms and management businesses, they're all performing well and proceeding on track. They continue to complement ourcore business nicely. ALC has commitments to purchase over $27 billion worth of aircraft, a total of 368 new aircraft from Airbus and Boeing, with deliveries through2023. ALC's fleet will more than double in size over the next five years as we deliver over 300 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing. We expect 45 of theseaircraft to deliver in 2018, accounting for approximately $3.7 billion of capital expenditures. As should be no surprise to you, we anticipate further delays in our deliveries from Airbus due to engine issues. So as happened in 2017, there maybe shifts from quarter-to-quarter in CapEx. The commitment table in our 10-K includes deliveries as best as we know them today. Right now, weanticipate 10 A320 or A321 Pratt & Whitney-powered neos accounting for approximately 15% of the year's total CapEx delivering in 2018. In the wake of these ongoing delays, we continue to help our impacted customers by extending existing leases, offering substitute aircraft andseeking other remedies from the OEMs. The leasing industry and ALC, in particular, shines in its ability to solve problems and smooth over roughspots in the industry, acting as a buffer and stabilizer. And Air Lease does so profitably. As to other perceived challenges ahead, of course, we're looking at higher interest rates, but fortunately, all of you who followed us know that wehave interest rate adjusters in our lease contracts for forward deliveries, which increased our lease rates as interest rates rise. Additionally, 85% ofour debt is fixed on the long end of our maturity curve with 15% floating more on the short end. We continue to issue prudently in the debt capitalmarkets, enjoying very strong demand on our bond offerings, which Greg Willis will talk to you more about. And as a result, you've seen a continueddrop in our overall cost of funds. So, I believe, we're in good shape as to the interest rate environment. We believe lease rates for the industry willrise over time as a result of interest rate increases. Equally as important as how we left 2017 is how we enter 2018. And I can tell you, we believe in the strength of our business, and with the tailwindsfrom additional capital available through tax reform, the ALC team proceeds enthusiastically and confidently into the remainder of 2018. I want to extend our heartfelt thanks to our outstanding team at ALC who delivered our results for 2017. They are quite simply the best in thebusiness. In conclusion, 2017 was a great year for Air Lease. Accordingly, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share on ouroutstanding common stock for the fourth quarter of 2017. And with that, let me now turn the call over to our Executive Chairman, Steve Hazy, who will provide further ALC remarks and color on the industry. Steve, over to you.",False,True

I echo John's sentiments surrounding Air Lease's strong performance in 2017 and the strong outlook for ourbusiness going forward.

The strategy that we envisioned at the inception of the company only eight years ago continues to underpin the strength of theresults you see today.

1376,64389883,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call,Gregory B. Willis,Air Lease Corporation,"Thank you, Steve. As mentioned earlier, we reported another great quarter, generating diluted earnings per share of $1.06 before the effect of taxreform, which added an additional $3.16 to the quarter. The quarterly results were driven by a number of factors, for which I will spend a fewminutes walking you through the details. First off, our total revenues increased by 7.6% to $398 million, which was driven by our aircraft activity and our portfolio lease yields remainingconstant. The fourth quarter was our largest quarter of the year in terms of CapEx. Our team purchased 12 aircraft, representing $904 million inCapEx, of which 60% delivered in December. Aircraft sales, trading and other activities increased slightly to $20 million, which included $14.4 millionin gains from the sale of two aircraft and insured losses of two aircraft, as well as $3 million in management fees. Also contributing to the increasein revenues was an increase in overhaul revenue, net of amortization of initial direct costs. The increase stems from the recognition of End of Leaseincome from the Air Berlin and Monarch bankruptcies and is a testament to the strength of our lease security packages. These security packagesprotect us against airline and credit events and are used to offset the impacts of lost revenues during the periods of transitions, shelter us from thecost incurred during these transitions and provide us security against the condition of the aircraft. As we said in the last call, we experienced strongdemand for these aircraft and have executed lease agreements with new airlines. And as you would expect, we anticipate the remainder of these aircraft will be re-delivered in the first quarter. Accordingly, this End of Lease incomehas more than offset the transition costs that elevated our SG&A in the quarter and compensated us for these aircraft not contributing rentalrevenue in the period, which, in aggregate, represented $7 million. Transitioning to expenses. First off, SG&A was higher when compared to the prior year and prior quarter. And as I just noted, this is partially a resultof the aircraft transition costs. As you'll recall, SG&A was exceptionally low in the third quarter as there were fewer transitional-related items. It'sworth highlighting that we ended the year with 87 employees with over $15 billion assets. We continue to deliver best-in-class operating efficiencyand expect that our revenue growth will continue to outpace our SG&A growth going forward. Second, interest expense for the quarter was slightly higher as compared to the third quarter of 2017 as a result of higher debt balances. You willsee, however, that we continue to benefit from a reduction of our composite cost of funds. Our composite cost of funds is now 3.2%, down morethan 6% for the year ended 2016, and our fixed-rate cost is now 3.3%, down more than 100 basis points from 2014 when the 10-year treasury wasat similar levels as it is today. Transitioning to tax, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017, we recorded a net tax benefit of $354 million in the fourthquarter, resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities at a new statutory rate of 21%. This revaluation increased ALC's equitybase, providing us increased flexibility for opportunistic growth. In addition to the effects of tax reform, we recorded an $11 million tax benefitfrom the utilization of foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 22%, as comparedto around 35.5% historically. Looking forward to 2018, we expect to deliver 45 aircraft from our order book, representing $3.7 billion in capitalexpenditures. We are expecting $440 million in CapEx in Q1, $1.25 billion in Q2, $770 million in Q3 and $1.2 billion in Q4. Consistent with prioryears, these numbers do not include any incremental purchases as this relates to aircraft sales. Consistent with John's comments, we're anticipatingno aircraft sales in the first half of 2018. Moving to the financing side of the business. Since our last call, we issued $2.3 billion in senior unsecured notes across the curve, issuing 3s, 5s, 7sand 10s. The weighted average cost of these issuances was 3% with the weighted average life of these issuances being 6.4 years. ALC ended 2017with a substantial level of liquidity at $3.2 billion including our four-year revolving credit facility, which stands at $3.9 billion. Looking ahead, we remain committed to our financing strategies of 80% fixed rate debt, 90% unsecured debt and a debt-to-equity target ratio of2.5:1. As of 12/31/2017, we were at 85% fixed, 95% unsecured and a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.35x. As John noted, revaluing our deferred tax liabilityin the fourth quarter resulted in our debt-to-equity ratio decreasing to 2.35x. However, there's no change to our target leverage ratio of 2.5x. Thisconcludes my review of the results and financing activities of the company. I'll now turn it back to Mary Liz.",False,True

We've seen decreases in the Boeing 777 production rates, leading up to the introduction of the Boeing 777Xplanned for 2020. We've seen reduction in production rates on the A330s, as the A330neo comes online later this year. The A350 production ratesare almost now at 10 a month, so that's the target rate that Airbus has forecast. And on the single aisle airplane category, you see the results thatBoeing and Airbus published in terms of how many units they actually delivered in 2017. And you can just divide that by 12 and see what theaverage output was. There was a surge of deliveries for both companies, Airbus and Boeing, in the December month to get as many aircraft deliveredto their customers. We'll see a much slower level of activity in January and February. But both are working very hard to make some small productionrate increases on a progressive basis and, basically, to cure a problem that they have in that they're overbooked right now on single aisle aircraft.They have more orders for the next three years than they can actually produce. So, you're going to see some reshuffling of some deliveries by someairlines. You'll see decelerations, you'll see some postponements, you'll see some accelerations like Air Lease.

Look, for the last five or six years, we've been deeply, and in greatdetail, engaged with Boeing on defining what is the optimal aircraft size and capability, because they do have a gap between the 737 and the 787,an airplane that could replace 757, 767, some of the older smaller widebody aircraft. And I think Boeing is going through a continued refinementof that definition. They're also looking very closely internally as to what the cost of implementing such a program, and then coming up with aneconomical pricing formula that the airlines and the leasing community can actually afford and justify. So that process is ongoing. I know thatBoeing had a lot of resources dedicated to this. But we're just not in the position to make any predictions whether it would be launched at the airshow this year or next year or later this year. It's all got to come together. The business case has to come together for Boeing. The supply chain hasto be properly lined up to avoid the catastrophes of the 787 startup. It's got to be affordable. It has to be an airplane that's capable of filling thosegaps that I mentioned earlier. And it has to be an attractive economic proposition for the lessors and the airlines.

So, a long-haul, low-cost operator doesn'thave a network balance to offset some of that degradation in traffic in the winter months, it's going to have issues in the fourth and the first quarter.So, what we'll see is some of these airlines will make adjustments to perhaps capture North, South traffic or entry into the Caribbean or other waysof sort of neutralizing those seasonalities. But -- because when you have a very high capital cost airplane flying 400 hours a month, and you'reflying at a 50% or 60% load factor, there's no way to make money. So, these airlines will have to figure out ways of using those assets, year-roundon an efficient basis. Now what we've seen in other parts of the world, like AirAsia X and Jetstar, which is owned by Qantas, those airlines are nowprofitable on a year-round basis because they have -- they've been around longer, and they've made adjustments to the way they operate theirnetworks.

And then, broadly speakingfrom your experience, how does rates rising affect how airlines think about the attractiveness of leasing versus other types of aircraft financing?And then, on lessor competition, I'm wondering what you've seen in the past for how rising rates affects competition.

So, we seethat actually as a net positive in how airlines view the operating lease specifically. Competitively, everyone pays for money. I don't care whereyou're from. And so, I really see everybody on a more equal playing field there with the cost of funds going up. That's a consequence that allfinanciers and lessors have to have.

But we don't expect the island of Great Britain to be cut off from the rest of theworld in terms of airline transportation. I think there will be deals forged because, after all, a lot of foreign airlines do tremendous business flyingto the U.K. and the U.K. airlines fly outside the U.K. So I think, there will be a solution, and it will probably have minimal, if any, effect on Air Lease.",True,False

Can you just talk about the overall used aircraft market? Do you think it's more of a buyer or a seller's markettoday?

Plueger,Air Lease Corporation,"No. We still have more people coming to us to buy airplanes than, frankly, we have to sell. What I'm trying to say in our remarks is, with the successof a transfer of a number of midlife aircraft at Thunderbolt that we did last year, we have just under 10% of our aircraft left in our fleet that are overeight years of age. And we adhere to our founding principles which is we like to enjoy the aircraft about the first 1/3 of its useful life or 25 years, sothat's eight-plus years and change. So I would say, no, I would say, it is still a seller's market for aircraft as evidenced by everybody that keeps comingto us and others for a robust demand of all aircraft. Our -- I think Steve framed it well, we're focusing on growth of our asset base. Because we'reearning good yields, good returns on these products, and we have a little bit of capital now additionally through the benefit of the tax Reform Act.So naturally, we're going to utilize that, grow accordingly.

In our last Investor Day, we show show our chart of our historical portfolio lease yield over the last five, six years, and it was incredibly consistent.We've done a great job of preserving our lease yields as rates went down. Also it graphs out of our average age and our average lease term to showthat those two key variables were also constant. So we weren't playing with the age or the lease duration. And then as I mentioned earlier, right,we're starting to see upward pressure on our lease rates on our aircraft that are delivering with interest rate adjusters as a function of the currenthigher interest rates environment that we're looking at today, right? But it's also really important to point out on the financing side that the lasttime the 10-year treasury was this high, our fixed-rate financing costs were 100 basis points higher.

Plueger,Air Lease Corporation,"Well, look, the engine care agreements have actually been there for quite a number of years. And yes, of course the engine OEMs are pushing theseengine care agreements. There's a benefit to us in that it helps our airline customers manage the return, the condition of the engines at return ofthe lease. And we are assured also of the quality maintenance pursuant to delivery of these engines to the OEM shops during the course of thelease. So, it actually is a strength to our residual values. As to the reliability, et cetera, well, things haven't started off really robustly, I would just say.But nevertheless, those things are getting fixed. And most of the engine care programs, properly drafted, put the burden back on the engine guysif there's any reliability or performance degradation issues across the board.

1450,64389883,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call,John L. Plueger,Air Lease Corporation,"Well, let me just start with the first part. We have both. So, three large engine providers, Pratt, Rolls and GE. We have both types of, agreements.We have agreements where we are past the reserves and that, at various points, we pass them on to the OEM. We also have --[agreements] wherethe engine care payments go directly to the OEMs. And sometimes, we receive a separate reserve for, what's called LLPs. So, we have all kinds ofagreements. I have no idea what -- I mean we have 360 some odd airplanes on our forward orders which we have today. I have no idea whatpercentage from that total is going to be covered under engine care programs. I mean just sitting here today, that is the business model of theengine manufacturers. And by the way, that model transfers risk to them as I indicated in my comments. So, it's hard for us to sit here and say howfar forward our order book will be. Not all, not all of our customers, are using the engine care program. So, I would say the majority of the aircraft,     the new technology, the neos, the MAXs, 787s, probably more than half of our customers will want to avail themselves of these engine care programsbecause they shed risk.",True,False
1451,64389883,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Air Lease Corp Earnings Call,Steven F.

So as more and more shops are able to handlethese engines, these new technology engines that could actually be some headwinds toward an airline, joining this program because they'll havevarious alternatives where to send the engines for heavy maintenance.

1460,64388077,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call,Douglas J. Pferdehirt,TechnipFMC plc,"Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. We delivered another quarter of solid results, further demonstrating our commitment to strong operational execution, the realization of mergersynergies and a commercial focus that's driven to take a completely new business model to market and win. Q4 serves as another importantmilestone in our brief history that further validates our commitment to deliver results for all of our stakeholders. Total company revenues were $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter, with all segments delivering strong performance in the period. Total adjustedEBITDA was $573 million, demonstrating strong growth over the prior year period, with margins up 360 basis points to 15.6% on a pro forma basis.Total company orders were $3 billion and year-end backlog stands at $13 billion. And in Subsea, we achieved a full year book-to-bill of just under1 on the strength of a solid Q4 inbound. 2017 proved to be a strong start to our first year as TechnipFMC. The women and men of our new company stepped up to the challenge in thistime of significant change, achieving early and important success for our company. Executing and winning, that's how we drove our success in2017, and we see even more opportunity ahead given the strength of our market positions and our advantages in both new business models andnew technologies. Solid execution led to our strong financial results. Operationally, we have relentlessly focused on project execution. And despitethe usual distractions of merger integration, our operational performance was both ahead of plan and market expectations. We have been delivering some of the most complex and challenging projects across the globe. Importantly, we have executed without losingfocus on the most important element, the health and wellbeing of our employees and partners. I would also like to reiterate that we're delivering on our merger synergies and doing so ahead of plan, and we are well on track to generate $450million in annualized savings by the end of 2019. In addition to executing on our large backlog of projects, we also secured several new awards over the course of the year. 2017 marked the inflectionin Subsea order activity, with operators moving forward on final investment decisions for several major developments. This resulted in a significantstep-up in our full year Subsea inbound to $5.1 billion, a 27% increase year-over-year. Our integrated business model is expanding the deepwater opportunity set with new Subsea projects, many of which would have never movedforward without the significant benefits we can bring to the market. And our differentiation extends beyond iEPCITM, with a continued focus ondeveloping the next generation of technology. In November, we announced the launch of a completely new suite of products we call Subsea 2.0. This technology portfolio significantly reducesthe size, weight and part count of the equipment installed on the seabed. The market reception has been highly encouraging, with strong operatorinterest. We also continue to make substantial progress with new offerings in the LNG, FLNG and Surface markets. Now let me discuss the market outlook. When we consider the Subsea market over our longer-term time horizon, 3 themes are very evident to us.Smaller projects and direct awards are becoming a much more meaningful portion of our order mix. In 2017, these awards represented just overhalf of our total inbound, with the remainder being named projects and Subsea services. Subsea tiebacks are often part of this mix. These shorter-cyclebrownfield expansions provide operators with faster paybacks and higher returns. We also see a growing trend towards independents and newentrants undertaking subsea developments. TechnipFMC is the natural partner for this customer group. And natural gas developments are growingin prominence. By early next decade, we could see more than half of offshore capex directed at gas developments. Looking more broadly to the natural gas markets. Natural gas continues to take share of global energy demand. This trend is structural, driven bymarket preference for cleaner energy sources and the need to satisfy growing domestic demand in markets such as the Middle East. To meet thisdemand, large gas projects will need to be sanctioned between now and 2020 and more beyond that.     and new technologies to further improve our competitive position. Despite near-term revenue pressure in our 2 largest businesses, the marketsin which we operate continue to improve. We expect to benefit from continued operational momentum and further progression of our synergysavings. And our 2017 performance gives us greater confidence in 2018. I will now turn the call over to Maryann.",False,True
1461,64388077,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call,Maryann T. Mannen,TechnipFMC plc,"Thanks, Doug. While our discussions today focus on fourth quarter results, we are pleased with our full year results as well, which demonstratedsolid execution in all of our business segments throughout the entire year. Our previous restructuring activities, the merger synergies we havecaptured and the further plans we have for sustainable cost reductions should all be supportive of achieving 2018 expected results. Let me now focus on the quarter. As Doug said, and I will reiterate given its importance, total company adjusted EBITDA was $573 million in thequarter. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 360 basis points to 15.6% despite a revenue decline of 16%. This is the resultof good project execution and incremental cost savings. Our execution both in our Onshore/Offshore and Subsea projects supported the marginperformance in the quarter and full year. Improving activity levels in Surface Americas and the benefit of the restructuring initiative and client-focusedactions demonstrated the leverage in our North American land business. We believe these quarterly results are another example of our improvingoperational performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the quarter were $0.20 when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.53per diluted share. These charges and credits totaled $245 million, including the impact of tax reform. We have provided more detail for these itemsin the accompanying schedules to our release. We incurred $138 million of charges related to tax reform in the quarter, most of which was relatedto U.S. tax reform. When you exclude these charges and other discrete items, the effective tax rate in Q4 was approximately 33%. Also recorded inthe quarter was $91 million of additional liability related to our joint venture partners that was recorded within net interest expense. We endedthe quarter with net cash of $2.9 billion. Looking more closely at the segment highlights. Subsea EBITDA margins showed resilience against a significant top line reduction, declining just70 basis points with revenue down 36%. The strength in margins reflect strong project execution and the cost-reduction initiative that helpedmitigate the negative impact of the reduced project activity. Subsea backlog increased sequentially to $6.2 billion, achieving our strongestbook-to-bill of the recovery cycle so far at over 1.3. And $3.4 billion of this backlog can be executed in 2018. Onshore/Offshore posted very strong adjusted EBITDA margin performance of 14.6%, benefiting from the realization of key milestones on severalmajor projects and from projects with net favorable commercial closeouts. This also reduces risks looking forward. In the quarter, we announced the award for the BAPCO Refinery Expansion project. This award will be reflected in our first quarter inbound. Similarto the treatment of the Coral FLNG project award, we will not fully consolidate the financial results as we are not the majority owner of the jointventure. However, this project has significant economic value for our Onshore/Offshore operations. Inbound orders of nearly $900 million in the period were mostly made up of a collection of smaller awards. As we foreshadowed last quarter, wesaw the potential for large project inbound in the coming quarters. Moving to Surface Technologies. Margins increased more than 1,400 basis points to 20.4%. Revenues increased nearly 23% from the prior yearperiod. The significant year-over-year improvement in surface reflects the sharp recovery in the North American land market, strong operationalleverage on a restructured cost base, and some pricing improvements. We expect that our product offering and integrated model will furtherimprove the top line in 2018. In comparison, international markets were largely stable with continued pricing pressures in some regions. Turning to guidance. We provided preliminary segment guidance for our 2018 with our Q3 results in October. Today, we are confirming segmentguidance for Subsea and Surface Technologies while raising Onshore/Offshore EBITDA margin guidance. Please note that this guidance includesthe effect of merger synergies expected to be realized in 2018 and excludes all charges and credits.     Let me now provide some additional thoughts on a few of the new and updated guidance items. First, in Onshore/Offshore, we are raising EBITDAmargin guidance to at least 10.5% from at least 9.5%. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved sequentially throughout 2017, with notable strength inQ4 that was driven by strong execution as well as favorable completion on several projects in the quarter. While it may be difficult to match thisperformance throughout 2018, we are further adjusting our margin expectations higher on the continued strength of our operational performance.Our revenue expectations for Onshore/Offshore remain the same and incorporate a lower contribution from Yamal LNG. We remain confident inthe execution of our backlog. Turning to corporate expense. We are seeing the benefit of corporate synergies, and therefore, expect corporate cost in a range of $40 million to$45 million per quarter, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. While much of our merger integration work is complete, the majorityof the expected $100 million in spending is for further restructuring efforts in 2018. With respect to our guidance for tax, we now expect our taxrate for 2018 to fall in the range of 28% to 32%. Earnings mix should revert to lower rate tax jurisdictions as a result of both business mix and ananticipated reduction in project cost in lower tax regions, where such losses have no offsetting tax benefit. Much of the tax-related restructuring work initiated since the merger close has now been completed. While the benefits of this work are reflectedwithin our guidance, we do anticipate some additional improvement in 2019 before contemplating the effects of any change in earnings mix. Theremaining guidance items are all outlined on slide 12 of the earnings call presentation and in the earnings release. The fourth quarter concluded a successful first year of TechnipFMC. While our focus is clearly on the opportunity for 2018 and beyond, some ofthe accomplishments made in our first year should serve as catalyst to our longer-term plans. Our risk management discipline contributed to strongproject execution in both Subsea and Onshore/Offshore segments. All of our operations performed well, meeting or exceeding operational marginperformance while identifying cost-reduction opportunities for the benefit of future periods. This remains a focus for us today. And our organizationdelivered synergies ahead of our plan for $200 million in 2017, and we have raised the total savings target to $450 million in annualized savingsby the end of 2018. We commenced our capital allocation plan, taking a disciplined and balanced approach toward business investment andshareholder distributions. We remain committed to repurchasing the full authorization of up to $500 million in ordinary shares no later than theend of 2018. In addition, the company's Board of Directors has once again authorized and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13. We focusour actions in 2018 with confidence in the objective we control, confidence in future market penetration of our commercial models and newtechnologies and confidence on our execution and project delivery performance, plus the achievement of synergies and cost targets with sustainablecost benefit. We think these items form the major building blocks from which we will create shareholder value. Operator, you may open the call for questions.",False,True

1468,64388077,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call,Douglas J. Pferdehirt,TechnipFMC plc,"Thank you for the question, Bill. So let's go from the beginning. In terms of the concept work that we're doing through our Genesis team, as notedin my prepared remarks, their activity level has really accelerated and is quite high right now. I'd prefer not to give out exact counts, but it hascertainly seen a significant recovery from where we were over the last couple of years. In terms of active LNG FEED studies, some, as we've -- I talkedabout in my prepared remarks, I did not mention the Arctic LNG 2 FEED study that we have previously discussed on the earnings call as thatcontinues to progress right well -- quite well, as well as we've talked about the potential on some of our existing terrestrial LNG facilities, theopportunity to add additional trains. So that work is going on, on the, let's say, on the Onshore portion. On the Offshore portion, there's actually afew FEED studies going on. Some of them are around some of the big new discoveries. I'd rather let the operators comment than myself. But there'ssome associated gas on some of these larger new oil discoveries in these new regions. And one option to address the associated gas would be tointroduce FLNG into those projects. In terms of the timing of projects in 2018/2019, Bill, I think you represented it well. We have been in a periodof oversupply in LNG. There are, by most expectations, that should come into balance around 2025, which would mean if you want a FID and FLNG,which is a 60-month delivery or terrestrial project, which is closer to 7 years, it puts you into that time frame of '18, '19, '20, I'm needing to start tosee some FIDs move forward. So we're seeing it on the concept. We're seeing it flow through to the FEED. And as I highlighted in my preparedremarks, we see some of the larger projects now being discussed and actually shortlisting the amount of companies that are going to be participatingin those going forward. The actual timing to the award though, as you know, these are large projects. The timing tends to be a bit fluid, so I'd hateto predict if it's going to be '18 or '19 or how many are actually going to occur. But we do see a ramp-up in activity and do expect to see someadditional LNG awards in the coming years.",True,False

1470,64388077,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call,Gregory Brown,"Cr�dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Firstly then, in the LNG market, you mentioned LNG Canada and the operator group has suggested that yourselves in partnership with KBR andanother consortium have been invited to bid for lump sum EPC contract. It was obviously a very large opportunity, but you've also mentioned therisk management. I was wondering if you'd be able to comment on your appetite to take on such a project on a lump-sum basis and how youwould intend to assess the risk involved? That's the first question. And on the second one, perhaps on Subsea. Are you seeing any sort of a trendwhereby aftermarket or services work is bundled into an additional order? I guess that's part of your integrated life of field offering. So are youseeing any positive momentum there?",True,False
1471,64388077,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call,Douglas J. Pferdehirt,TechnipFMC plc,"Thank you, Gregory, for the questions. So I'll take them in the order that you presented them. So we have a very robust process in terms of theselectivity around the types of projects, the projects and the types of commercial models that we will accept on projects. And you'll see over aperiod of time, as we've demonstrated at our Analyst [Day] event just back in November, that we moved our portfolio from being predominantlylump sum, turnkey projects to really introducing a much more robust reimbursable or services component to our Onshore/Offshore portfolio. Andwe're really quite proud of that, really supported by the strength of our process technologies group and the differentiation that, that brings as wellas our project management consulting, both of which drive a large portion of our service or our reimbursable activities. The contract that youmentioned, the LNG Canada, indeed, we've been shortlisted. We're very excited about the project. We're working closely with the customer, andwe believe that there's a lot of learnings that we could bring to make that project successful both in the use of the fabrication of mega modulesand a lot of the work that we've done on other recent LNG terrestrial projects that we're currently working on. So we think we have a lot to bringto that project. I will maybe correct you on the lump-sum turnkey portion of that. This is a contract that's still under discussion. There's still discussionsbetween us and the customer in terms of which portion of the contract, if any, would be taken as a lump-sum turnkey portion. It would be reasonableto expect that a portion of the contract would be lump-sum turnkey. It is not reasonable to expect that the full contract would be lump-sum turnkey,but that's a discussion, an ongoing discussion we're having with the client. In terms of some Subsea and Subsea services and the bundling, there'sreally 2 components. Typically, the activity you're associated with the project, or if you will, the installation of the equipment, the initial installationof the equipment indeed tends to be part of the initial project and part of the scope of that project. But it's important to understand that we haveover 50% of the installed base of all Subsea equipment in the world as TechnipFMCs. It requires ongoing inspection maintenance and repair,upgrading, et cetera. There's automation and control systems that naturally need to have firmware and software upgrades. All of these types ofthings are on a reoccurring basis and not normally part of that original contract. So it really depends how you look at the Subsea services. Again,the initial phase, the installation is typically part of it. But as we continue to grow and expand our offerings around Subsea services, some of themwould -- could be bundled as part of the initial integrated offering, but many of them will end up being call-up services. For instance, if the Subseawell is in need of intervention, nothing to do with the Subsea equipment, the wellbore itself, maybe there's a failure in the sand screen or maybethere's some other problem with the downhole, part of the downhole completion, the only way to access those Subsea wells is by using a companylike ourselves. And we're the market leader in Subsea well intervention, to be able to go out and be able to provide those services so that you canreenter those Subsea wells.",True,False
1472,64388077,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call,Operator,NA!,Your next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan.,True,False
1473,64388077,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call,Sean Meakim,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So Doug, just to start, I think we talked about the Subsea margin trajectory, just considering the strong performance in the fourth quarter, we'vetalked before about expectations for some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But how should that 4Q result guide investor expectations for the trajectorybetween first half and second half '18? Then I guess the other thing I was thinking about in that context is how should we think about the marginoutlook relative to the guidance band for revenue that you've offered? I mean, effectively, higher end of the revenue, should we think about atbeing positively correlated with the margin or negatively correlated? Just can you say anything about that flex within the guidance band?",True,False
1474,64388077,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call,Douglas J. Pferdehirt,TechnipFMC plc,"Okay, Sean, thank you. So indeed, we're very proud of the performance in -- of our Subsea -- across all 3 operating segments, but as you pointedout specifically in subsea in the fourth quarter. And I realized that in the context of the guidance of our 2018 even made it more -- even put morefocus on it. But it is important to point out, and we've said it before, there are headwinds as we transition and start to move from the existingbacklog in the inbound. We're very happy with the inbound in 2017. We'll start to see some of that flow through in 2018. We need to maintain thecompetencies and the capabilities to continue to deliver world-class projects to our customers. And therefore, we will continue to ensure that wehave the right workforce and assets to be able to manage that going into 2018 and beyond. We've talked a bit about the utilization of our fleet,     and there will be some softness as we transition into a greater SURF activity, which tends to come late -- at a later stage in the life cycle of theproject. You see the equipment side first and then the SURF-side a little bit later. So those are some of the headwinds that we face and why wethink that the margin guidance that we provided for 2018 is the appropriate margin guidance. In terms of the sequencing of it, I'd rather not getinto attempting to do quarterly guidance because so much of it really comes down to projects and project milestones. And when we achieve andclose out certain projects in a successful manner, that can have an impact as it did, by the way, in the fourth quarter of 2017. It is important to notethough and has been historical, the first quarter is always a soft quarter, and that mainly has to do with the weather associated with many of theareas that we operate our fleet. And therefore, we'll see less activity in our Riserless Light Well Intervention activity that I was referring to earlier onGregory's question, indeed is very soft in the first quarter as is historical. It picks up and hits its stride in Q2 and Q3. So indeed, we would expect astep-down in the first quarter. And in terms of the band relative to the revenue, I was going to let Maryann add some additional color on thatcomment.",True,False
1475,64388077,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call,Maryann T. Mannen,TechnipFMC plc,"Sean, thank you. So maybe just a few other comments to add to Doug. Keep in mind, we -- as Doug said earlier, we had planned for the inflectionpoint in 2016 to see the recovery of Subsea, and timing has a critical element attached to our margin performance. Obviously, the sooner we getinbound in, the faster we can execute. The later we get it, obviously the bit of a challenge to get it executed in a given year. One of the things thatwe've said is that we want to be sure that we retain all of the core competencies of our ongoing project management and our engineeringorganization. So we see that backlog growing. As Doug reiterated on his comments here this morning, we expect '18 to be another positive yearwith respect to Subsea inbound. So the timing of that, the sooner we get inbound, our ability to leverage that inbound improves, we could seesome positive momentum around the margins. And the other thing is we also talked about our investment in R&D to maintain our technologydevelopment, and that's certainly a part of our 2018 guidance as well.",True,False

And it's important to note, when we talk about the next generation of Subsea equipment, as we had a chance to demonstratefirst hand at our Analyst [Day] event in November, it's about making it real. Everybody can talk about things that they're doing. Ours is real. It hasbeen -- as we talked about at the Analyst [Day] event, it was there live and in person. And most importantly, we have already begun to receiveorders. As we indicated at the Analyst Day, we had not put the full suite of offering to the market. I'm very happy to say today that I can report thatwe received our first order for our automation and control, our new automation and controls, our next-generation automation and control system.We had previously informed the group that we had the first orders on the trees, and I don't remember if we said 8, 9 or 10, but it's in -- it continuesto grow our orders for our new compact robotic manifold. So we're now able to actively bid that entire suite to your point, Sean, and we're veryexcited about the impact that, that will have on the tenders that we're currently submitting. Up until now, we have not been able to tender thatentire offering because we were still going through qualification and -- well, just, yes, qualification and testing. That's now complete. We're in theprocess, the manifolds, as we discussed back in November. Or there, the tree will be installed very soon. And now we have the commitment onthe next-generation automation and control. And we always said it's as much about time as it is about cost, and it's just stunning. The next-generationautomation and control system, we're going to be able to do this in terms of months, not in terms of years in terms of being able to respond to thecustomer.

1479,64388077,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call,Rob Pulleyn,"Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Three questions, if I may. The first one is, if we look at what's happening in the Subsea installation market, whereby, including yourselves, theindustry is installing projects, which were sanctioned at the tail end of the last cycle. And yet we also hear that the new raft of projects essentiallyare becoming much shorter in lead time, shorter from FID to first oil. Surely, that also means that the time between FID and when the vessels areneeded also will be a lot faster. Is that leading to any bunching effect whereby key-enabling vessels, both in your fleets and your competitors, arebusy, and yet actually these inbound orders and the projects you see require these vessels, and that's creating actually some tightness maybeahead of expectations and the installation market? The second and third questions, please, to Maryann are a little bit on the housekeeping side.Could you possibly give us a bit of a steer on the working capital move to 2018, which will clearly be a key driver of free cash flow? And finally, interms of the U.S. tax reform, obviously, we saw the charge. Given you're already planning a significant improvement in the tax effect and that seemsto be captured in 2018 guidance, should we expect any further improvements in the tax range beyond 2018?",True,False
1480,64388077,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call,Douglas J. Pferdehirt,TechnipFMC plc,"Okay, Rob, I'll take the first one then. Actually, quite an intriguing insight. Clearly, if you make a long-cycle business short-cycle, if you are able todeliver the Subsea equipment as we described, in some cases, in 10 months versus 24 months, and now as TechnipFMC, the only Subsea companythat can deliver the equipment installed and commissioned on the seafloor, what you are describing is indeed a new reality in the business. Thegood news is we have that visibility because we're the ones doing the integrated FEED studies. So we have an idea where are those shorter-cycleopportunities. We build that into our roadmap. Clearly, we will prioritize the iEPCITM opportunities that we have to where we can do the fullyintegrated Subsea system installed on the seafloor. Speaking more broadly for the market, I don't think that the market is necessarily tight at thispoint, to be blunt. I think that what's your pointing out is that the tightness could occur sooner than most people anticipate, and I think that's afair statement.",True,False
1481,64388077,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call,Maryann T. Mannen,TechnipFMC plc,"And rob, Maryann here. So first question, working capital. For 2018, we do not expect to see the same level of working capital use as we did in 2017,in part because many of our projects are obviously coming to significant completion, but also because of the inbound that we're expecting. We'realso assuming that we will see incremental milestones in advance payments. So I would estimate somewhere in the range of about 50% of theworking capital use that we saw in 2017. Your second question was around U.S. tax reform, and I will tell you, for TechnipFMC, the U.S. tax reformis a net benefit. It's a plus. First and foremost, as you saw in the release, our charge is a noncash charge. Much of the restructuring work that we'vebeen sharing with you was completed by the end of October, and so our tax adjustment that was reported is really a noncash charge. We wereable to benefit from most of the work that we'd done with the restructuring or what we call the ""out from under"" net operating losses in the U.S.as well as foreign tax credits. So as we increase the amount of North American income, Doug talked about the strength in the North Americanmarket recovering to similar peaks of '14 and the leverage that we're seeing, this will be a net benefit. So in other words, what we normally wouldpay only on U.S. income at a 35% tax rate, we'll now pay a 21%. So as that North American income improves, we would expect to see incrementalbenefit going forward.",True,False

And as you know, we're happy to announce,of course, the successful start-up of first -- of Train 1 and first cargo. So what's remaining is Train 2 and Train 3. In the backlog that you see reported     for the Onshore/Offshore business, a total of about $6,369 million at the end of 12/31/2017, you can see a big portion of that, about $4.2 billion, isrecognizable in '18. And obviously, there is much of that backlog that is associated with Yamal. Having said that, there's still portions of reimbursablescope associated with Yamal that could help influence revenue in 2018.

The first is on the next generation of LNG, FLNG technologies that you're putting in place. Can you give us a flavor of whatis at stake here and what are the potential benefits for the clients? And second question relates to iEPCITM momentum. Can you disclose what wasthe amount of order intake that was linked to iEPCITM in 2017? So out of the $5.1 billion Subsea order intake, how much related to iEPCITM?",True,False
1486,64388077,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 TechnipFMC PLC Earnings Call,Douglas J. Pferdehirt,TechnipFMC plc,"Bertrand, thank you for the questions. So in terms of the next-generation LNG, FLNG, obviously, different applications, being offshore and terrestrial,but the objective remains the same, which is to achieve, as we are in the rest of our 2.0 portfolio and the vision for our company, to drive the projecteconomics by driving towards simplification, more system integration as well as new technologies that will result in a 50% reduction. So here, we'retalking about really driving towards being able to deliver LNG projects at a much lower cost, and therefore, a much more improved projecteconomics, be it from 2,000 metric ton down to 1,000 metric ton, which will bring LNG, particularly FLNG, into a completely new market, one thatI inferred earlier, which we market where there's associated gas with oil developments, which today would not bear the cost because of the reservecapacity for the current scale of FLNG. So that's one example of what we're working on there. In terms of iEPCITM in 2017, it was not a material portion.Again, it was -- the company was created in 2017. We were early in the conversion of integrated FEEDs to integrated EPCI. We didn't have thatmany opportunities. What we have said though is that by our second year of operation, which is this year 2018, we expect that to approach 25%of our total inbound will come from this new integrated model. Why is that important? These are direct awards, so we're not in the competitivemarketplace. And it's also our ability to get engaged early through the integrated FEED, demonstrate to our customer the value of our integratedbusiness model as well as our new technologies and then go into direct award for the execution phase of the project.

Understand that prior to theAnalyst Day, we had taken every major Subsea client, and in many cases, their Executive team through the technology demonstration area thatyou were able to see back at the Analyst [Day] event. So we -- they've been aware of it for some time. They've been looking at it. We've been,     therefore, setting up qualification programs with different clients or collectively with groups of clients, which is certainly the more efficient way togo about it, and we're past that. And that's a challenging Subsea, it takes quite a bit of time to go from the concept and the idea to really havingsomething qualified to be able to use in the Subsea environment. As we stated at the Analyst Day, the manifold was completed. The tree was nearcompletion, and we had, had our first order and we're looking forward to actually the installation of that in short order. Indeed, that's movingforward and will happen in the coming quarters. What is new from the Analyst Day was that the next-generation automation, which is actually asignificant step change, it really changes our entire operating model and makes it much more efficient for us as well, has now been -- we've nowreceived that award, and we'll be going to what's called TR level 4 and 5 as a result of that very soon.

Are you guys kind of thinking about thelonger-term margin dynamics in that business? I think historically, you guys just don't think about 10%, think about more like 5% or 6% kind ofmargins.

If you look historically, even in theprior years, without as much revenue coming from Yamal, the execution has been good and the margins really better than -- are competitive --better than the competitive landscape. When we think about going forward, our approach is really to try to continue to change the amount oflump sum and focus more on reimbursable scope. You saw from Analyst Day how we've already become that movement. Second, we are reallylooking for that opportunity to improve margins beyond that time period. We've said that we think margins in the range of 5% to 6% EBITDA areclearly a target, and we'll continue to work diligently to ensure that that's sustainable beyond that time period.

So I'll do this, the second one, and then I'll go back to the first one. To be very blunt, I would be quite surprisedif our competitors did not try to emulate what has been created with TechnipFMC. We've talked about 25% of our inbound in 2018 coming fromthis new integrated model. It's clearly having a level of market acceptance that I think far exceeded anyone's expectation because it's deliveringreal substantive and sustainable change needed in the industry. So actually, I would be surprised to the opposite if someone did not react. In termsof the actual transaction that you referenced, it's important to note that we have Genesis. Genesis is our agnostic front-end concept and front-end     engineering organization. It is extremely well known in the market. We have a phenomenal group of people within our Genesis team, and we arean industry leader. So just to put it in perspective, our Genesis organization is twice the size of the other organization that you were referencing.So again, no surprise that others are trying to emulate, but it's going to be very difficult. What was created with TechnipFMC by just bringingtogether 2 companies will not be possible by the combination of any other 2 companies. So we're a year into it. Second year of operation, we'reseeing 25% of our revenue come from this new integrated model.

And naturally, the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea come to mind as 2 of those markets where you might beseeing that trend.

So clearly, we have seen the first movement. If you go back in time, it really first occurredin the Gulf of Mexico, and we have some very strong long-term relationships with independents in the Gulf of Mexico, more -- and I would say andalso the U.K. sector, the North Sea. More recently, we're seeing the Norwegian sector of the North Sea where we have been very successful ataligning with the new operators, who we think -- and we're just a natural -- we're a natural partner for those type of projects because of our abilityto be able to provide the full integrated Subsea system. We're also seeing from a private equity point of view and from other small independentsmovement in other parts of the world, be it the Mediterranean or be it in Asia Pacific. And there, it's very interesting. And again, we -- because ofour relationship, because of the way that we have, we always form deep intimate relationships with our customers, very transparent and very --with a high track record of success in terms of delivering on the projects that we say we'll deliver on at the price we say we'll deliver on. I think wejust built -- the brand is quite strong and quite important in that area. Going forward, I think we'll see more of those types of awards. I would expectthose type of awards to also influence our iEPCITM in a very positive way as well as you could see awards where we may be offer even beyond justthe traditional integrated Subsea and include the FPSO or additional production capability because of the unique footprint of TechnipFMC.",True,False

I recognize that we released a lot of material last night and there's a lot there to digest.So I very much appreciate you taking the time to call in today. I do have one introductory comment before I open the floor for questions. Over the past year or so I've spent a lot of time talking to people who'vebeen disillusioned with investing in the oil and gas space because they believe industry management teams don't really care much about makinghigh returns on capital. My response to that concern is always that we agree with that. And that SM Energy's singular focus on achieving top-tierreturns as a measure of success in our business currently has us on a path of demonstrating a very high rate of change in the improvement of ourbusiness relative to our peers. I listened to our recorded call notes again and I'm sure we must have said 50 times that we focus on achieving high returns as measured by growthand cash flow per debt adjusted share. And that is how we have built our business plan, a plan that achieves about a 35% cash flow per debtadjusted share growth rate over the next several years. To be clear, production is an output from that planning process, not an input. We have never had a production growth rate metric in our long-term incentive plans here at SM. And even though we've averaged over a 98.5%approval rate on our say-on-pay votes over the last 5 years, we are going to modify our long-term incentive plan metrics this year to explicitlyinclude cash flow growth per debt adjusted share as a key performance measurement. We'll be disclosing more about that in our upcoming proxy. So with that, I'll open the floor for questions.",False,True

So you're probably aware we've been getting quite a bit more efficient on our rig rate drilling, how fast we'redrilling. And for example, what we would drill with 11 rigs in 2016, we can do with 8.5 rigs this year. And we also are going to large pads withco-development. And by doing that, we wind up with a large number of DUCs at a certain time and then we complete them and we bring themall online pretty quickly. So what you'll see is a large increase in the DUC count at the end of '18. And shortly thereafter, in '19, we bring those allonline. So we'll be spending completion dollars in '18 for a bunch of wells that come on in '19. I think -- does that answer the question for you?",True,False

But the IP was quite good on that Wolfcamp B. It reaffirmed our views from thatEastland well that Apache had drilled just to southwest of there.

I think it's probably around 84 -- 82 to 84 stages in that well compared to -- soeffectively 125-foot stage spacing versus our standard 167. We've been trying that in a number of places. So we're trying to do direct offsetcomparisons in some cases to see is the incremental investment in the additional stages worth it. So we're still in the testing stage on that.

So we have not had any issues with capacity. We've got vendors lined out and we've beenusing the same ones over and over again. They know our program, they know what to expect so that it can work quite effectively for them -- veryefficient for them. That goes to our rigs and our completion crews and then some of the ancillary services like cementing and logging. So we'vebaked in a certain amount of escalation. Some of it is where we have no escalation, we've got firm contracts. And then some, there's some linkageto prices where there's escalation based on certain price parameters.

Second piece of information is that we had 1 Eagle Ford well that was initially in the Eagle Ford for a good portion of the lateralbut then went up into the Austin Chalk. And we find that the condensate yield and NGL yields are higher in the Austin Chalk. So that's an attractiveeconomic proposition. Deliverability looked good, too. So we'll be testing that.

So yes, typicallyin the Wolfcamp A, we're going to be between 513 and 660-foot spacing. There's -- some of the Wolfcamp B further to the east will be going towider spacing because it makes sense there. And then in Sweetie Peck, we'll still be doing some 420s. And typically, the Lower Spraberry in SweetiePeck will be 420 to 513-foot spacing. And that's just because of how thick Lower Spraberry is over there.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call today. 2017 was a good year for Stepan Company. The company delivered record reported and adjusted net income for 2017, and we now have hadrecord income for 7 of the last 10 years. Reported net income in 2017 was $91.6 million, up 6% versus last year despite the $14.9 million unfavorablenet impact of the new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's legislation. Adjusted net income was $108.7 million, 11% higher than 2016. Adjusted net income as a percent of net sales was 5.7%, an increase of 10 basispoints versus 2016. Improved product mix, increased asset utilization and enhanced internal efficiencies continued to drive results. Both Surfactants and Polymersbenefited from our diversification strategy, and we anticipate further contributions in 2018.     For the full year, Surfactants delivered record operating income due to an improved product mix, lower manufacturing costs and the accretiveimpact of our 2016 Brazil acquisition. Sales benefited from our diversification efforts into Functional Products, higher sales within the household,industrial and institutional end markets and continued growth in more specialized applications. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the company approved a plan to restructure a portion of our production activities at our Fieldsboro facility. Wetransitioned impacted products to other Stepan sites in North America, and we expect to benefit from improved asset utilization and a reducedcost base going forward. Polymers delivered its second best full year results despite increased competitive pressure and higher raw material costs within our North AmericanPolyol business. Global Polyol volumes were up slightly, despite share loss in North America. The market for insulation materials remains strongdue to continued global energy-conservation efforts. The definitive agreement with BASF to acquire its surfactant production facility in Ecatepec, Mexico is on track to close this quarter. We believe theacquisition will significantly enhance our market position and supply capabilities for surfactants in Mexico and position us to grow in both theconsumer and functional end markets. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on Stepan's common stock of $0.225 per share, payable on March 15, 2018. At this point, I would like Matt to walk through a few more details about our fourth quarter and full year results.",False,True
1560,64388371,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Stepan Co Earnings Call,Matthew John Eaken,Stepan Company,"Thank you, Quinn. My comments will generally follow the slide presentation. Let's start with Slide #5 to recap the quarter. As Quinn stated, adjustednet income for the fourth quarter 2017 was a record $24.6 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, a 100% increase versus $12.3 million, or $0.52 perdiluted share, in 2016. Because adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure, we provide full reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measuresand these can be found in Appendix 2 of the presentation and Table 2 of the press release. Specifically, regarding adjustments to reported net income, this quarter included deferred compensation income of $1 million, or $0.04 per dilutedshare, compared to deferred compensation expense of $2.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Naturally, all employeecompensation expenses are reflected in our normal operating income. However, we allow employees the opportunity to defer their incentivepayouts until some future date and the future payment changes based on the company's stock price. When the stock price declines, income isgenerated as we mark this item to market value. Because the future liability of employee compensation only changes consistently with the changein the stock price, we exclude this item from our operational discussion. The new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation resulted in a net onetime expense of $14.9 million, or $0.64 per diluted share. The current quarterresults also included $800,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, of after-tax business restructuring charges. These charges related to decommissioningcosts from the closure of our Canadian plant announced in 2016 and severance costs associated with the partial restructuring of our Fieldsborosite. We expect an additional $2 million to $3 million of after-tax restructuring charges in 2018 related to decommissioning cost at these plants. Slide 6 shows the total company earnings bridge for the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, and breaks down the increase inadjusted net income. Because this is net income, the figures noted here are on an after-tax basis. Fourth quarter 2016 results were negativelyimpacted by $8.9 million of pretax nonrecurring costs, of which $8.3 million impacted Surfactants and $600,000 impacted Polymers. In addition,fourth quarter 2017 results were positively impacted by $4.7 million of pretax income related to the favorable resolution of a Surfactant productclaim in Europe. We will cover each segment in more detail, but Surfactants and Polymers were up, while Specialty Products was down versus theprior year. The bridge on Slide #6 excludes the impact of the new tax reform legislation because the onetime cost was excluded to arrive at adjusted netincome. Therefore, excluding the onetime impact, our effective tax rate did not significantly impact results for the quarter. For the full year, oureffective tax rate was 34.3% in 2017 compared to 24.3% in 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and     Specialty Product operating income was $10 million versus $10.7 million in the prior year. Slide #10 shows the total company earnings bridge for the full year 2017 compared to 2016. Like the quarterly bridge, the figures here are notedon an after-tax basis. Turning to Slide #11. It is important to note that our balance sheet remains strong as we had no net debt at year-end. The company generated$101 million of free cash flow during 2017, a 10% increase versus prior year. The company entered into a $350 million unsecured revolving line ofcredit in January 2018, which will provide the company with flexibility to fund future growth opportunities. In 2017, we also increased our cash dividends for the 50th consecutive year, placing us in a very select group of companies. Beginning on Slide #12, Quinn will now address our path forward to further increase shareholder value.",False,True
1561,64388371,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Stepan Co Earnings Call,"F. Quinn Stepan, Jr.",Stepan Company,"Thank you, Matt. After record results in 2016 and 2017, we believe our Surfactant business will continue to benefit from our diversification effortsinto Functional Products, new technologies, expanded share into our broad customer base globally and the stabilization of commodity surfactantvolumes. However, headwinds in our North American Polymer business related to last year and lower margins will continue to challenge us in 2018. Resultswill benefit from the lower U.S. corporate tax rate. Longer term we believe that our strategy to leverage our market leadership positions to diversifyour products and end markets, to collaborate with customers on new chemistries and to focus on operational excellence will drive shareholdervalue. Turning to Slide #13. We believe that our market leadership position in several of our businesses is a strong foundation from which we can grow.First, we are the largest producer of anionic and amphoteric surfactants for the merchant market in the Western Hemisphere. And we will advancethis position with the acquisition of the BASF plant and associated business in Ecatepec, Mexico. We believe our commodity anionic position shouldstabilize and potentially grow in 2018. Next, we are the second-largest supplier of biodegradable fabric softener actives globally. Esterquats are the preferred technology in the developedworld and are being adopted in the developing world. With plants in all 4 regions of the world, Stepan is positioned to capture market growth. Finally, as a leading producer of rigid polyester polyols globally, we remain optimistic about the continued growth of the market due to increasedinsulation standards, energy-conservation efforts and growth in construction. Although we experienced headwinds in our North American Polyol business during 2017, our European business remains strong. Now turning to Slide #14. Our diversification efforts continue to be a key component of our long-term strategy. First, over the last several years,we have worked very closely with many large agricultural companies, and we believe Stepan chemistries will be included in many of their productlaunches over the next 36 months. With regards to surfactant chemistries for oilfield, Stepan has a relatively low market share today. But we have significant opportunities to grow.Stepan's portfolio of chemistries including biocides and foamers are well suited for use in the production of oil. And in fact, volumes on thesechemistries grew over 20% last year, albeit from a small base. Next, growth within the Tier 2 and Tier 3 customer base continues to be a key priority for our Surfactant business. And our sales to this segmentgrew 8% in 2017.",False,True

1590,64388616,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Bel Fuse Inc Earnings Call,Daniel Bernstein,Bel Fuse Inc.,"Thank you, Lynn. Before going through the financials, I want to provide a brief update on how the businesses did from the operation standpointthis quarter and what we see going forward. Sales during the fourth quarter were $119.9 million, up 1.2% from the fourth quarter of 2016, led by sales growth within our Connectivity Solutionsgroup of 8.1%. This was partially offset by the decline in sales at our Magnetic Solutions products of 1% and our Power Solutions and Protectiongroup of 3.3%. While sales increased during the fourth quarter over last year, our bottom line was unfavorably impacted by the following items: an $18 millionincrease to our TARP provision related to the new tax reform; $1 million of incremental interest expense related to the acceleration of deferredfinance costs at our prior credit facility in connection with our refinancing; inventory-relating charges totaling $2 million, which had 170 basispoints impact on our gross margins for the quarter; and a $1.1 million increase in consulting fees related to our ERP implementation. As many ofthese items are not expected to reoccur in 2018, we anticipate improved profitability going forward. Looking at the full year, we are pleased that 2 of the 3 product groups showed year-over-year sales increase from 2016. Our Magnetic Solutionsgroup closed the year with $5.8 million increase in sales over 2016 levels, largely due to our new product introduction with our ICM and SignalTransformer product lines. We have been expanding the presence of our magnetic products through our distributor channels, which also continueto grow year-over-year sales growth. Our Connectivity Solutions group had year-over-year sales growth of $1.5 million. Our Cinch business increased revenue by $7.1 million comparedto 2016, led by a strong demand for our active optical products using flight-grade, high-speed communications and encrypted (inaudible). Thetop line growth in Cinch was also aided by more breadth and depth of our products going through distribution channels throughout the year.These gains on Cinch side were largely offset by a $5.6 million decline in sales within our Stewart Connector business due to customer consolidationin late 2016. There has been renewed focus on repositioning the Stewart's business, which has led to a $1.5 million or 43% increase in Stewartbacklog since 2016. Our Power Solutions and Protection group had yet another challenging year in 2017, with a $15.8 million decline in sales in 2016. Much of thatdecrease related due to a $10.1 million drop in sales from our NPS product line, which previously divested. Sales of our upfront -- front-end board-- I'm sorry. Sales of our front-end and board-mounted power products declined further in 2017 as large OEM customers continue to have lowerdemand for their hardware products. These declines were offset by growth within our Power Europe Group in Italy, which generated $3.1 millionof higher sales related to marine and broadcast applications. Our circuit protection business has also experienced much success in 2017 with better utilization of our distribution channels yielding of $1.2million or 11% increase in circuit protection sales compared to 2016. Although our 2017 sales were not very impressive from the overall PowerSolutions and Protection group, we did see a turning point in the fourth quarter as that was the first quarter since 2014 acquisition of PowerSolutions business, where we saw a year-over-year growth excluding the effects of the NPS divestiture. On a regional basis, in Europe, increased sales by $3.2 million or 4.2% increase in 2017 as compared to 2016. Sales in North America decreased by$10.9 million or 4.3%. And sales in Asia were lower by $770,000 or a 5% decrease. On a consolidated basis, the company's backlog has increased to $146.5 million at December 31, 2017, which represents a $33 million increase ora 29% increase from its level at December 2016. While we're unable to predict the effect that this increase will ultimately have on 2018 sales, it's agood parameter we're well positioned for organic growth in the future periods over the next 4 quarters. At this point, I'd like to turn over the call to Craig.",False,True
1591,64388616,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Bel Fuse Inc Earnings Call,Craig Brosious,Bel Fuse Inc.,"Thanks, Dan. As previously mentioned, sales during the fourth quarter were $119.9 million, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross profitmargin declined to 18.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with 20.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. This was largely due to $2 million ofinventory-related adjustments recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. Our selling, general administrative expenses were $21.2 million or 17.7% of sales as compared with $16 million or 13.5% of sales in the fourthquarter of 2016. The $5.2 million increase in SG&A costs from last year's fourth quarter resulted from several factors. Foreign currency gains of $2.7million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 did not recur during the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, there were incremental costs in thefourth quarter of 2017 related to our ERP system implementation and higher professional fees related to tax consulting and the adoption of thenew revenue recognition standard as compared to the 2016 period. On a go-forward basis, we would expect SG&A to run between $20 million and $21 million per quarter in the near term, barring any significantfluctuations in foreign currency. As a result of these factors, we generated income from operations of $708,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 ascompared to $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 also included $1 million gain on the sale of a property in San Diego, which had a favorableeffect on last year's operating income. Interest expense was $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up $900,000 from the same period last year.During the fourth quarter of 2017, we refinanced our credit agreement, which caused us to accelerate $1 million of amortization related to ourprior deferred financing costs. The impact of higher interest rates in 2017 was mitigated by our lower debt balance compared to 2016. The terms under the new credit facility improved our pricing grid over the new 5-year term, which should help to offset increases in the LIBOR rate.Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a provision of 1,219% compared to a provision of 46.9% during last year's fourth quarter.The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an $18 million impact related to the U.S. tax reform recorded during the fourthquarter of 2017. This consisted of a $16 million transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings and incremental tax provision of $2 millionrelated to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets due to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate. Based on a 2-year average of where our profits have historically been earned, we are estimating that the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rateoffset by the effects of the GILTI tax on our low tax foreign income will result in an estimated global effective tax rate of between 17% and 19% for2018. Loss per share for the Class A common shares was $1.66 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with earnings of $0.27 per share inthe fourth quarter of 2016. Loss per share for the Class B common shares was $1.74 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared withearnings of $0.29 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes certain unusual and other nonrecurring items, EPS for Class A shares was a loss of $0.09 per share in thefourth quarter of 2017 as compared with earnings of $0.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS for Class B shares wasa loss of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with earnings of $0.33 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. And now I'd like to go through some balance sheet and cash flow items. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2017, was $69.4million, a decrease of $4.1 million from December 31, 2016. During 2017, we made net payments of $18.8 million towards our outstanding debtbalance. We also used cash for capital expenditures of $6.4 million, dividend payments of $3.3 million and interest payments of $4.4 million. Accounts receivables was $78.8 million at December 31, 2017, as compared with $74.4 million at December 31, 2016. Days sales outstanding was60 days at December 31, 2017. The increase in our accounts receivable balance was largely due to the higher sales volume in the fourth quarter of2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, coupled with an increase in DSO, which was primarily a function of the timing of payments fromlarger customers in our Asia segment.     Inventories were $107.7 million at December 31, 2017, up $8.8 million from December 31, 2016. The increase was seen mostly in raw materials andfinished goods to accommodate the increase in bookings during 2017. Accounts payable was $47.9 million at December 31, 2017, up slightly fromDecember 31, 2016, due to the increase in raw material purchases. Bel's total outstanding debt as of December 31, 2017, was $125 million, excluding deferred financing cost. This represents a net decrease of $18.8million from our 2016 year-end debt level. Book value per share, which is calculated as stockholders' equity divided by our combined A and Bclasses of stock, outstanding was $13.13 per share at December 31, 2017, as compared to $13.17 per share at December 31, 2016.

There was -- one was related to the valuation of some inventory, where we had to make an adjustment to our purchaseprice variance allocation to the inventory -- between cost of sales and our inventory balance. So that was an item that kind of arose as we werereviewing the year-end balances. The other item was some inventory that we had a reserve on in prior periods. Again, expecting that we wouldbe able to do some rework on some products that whether the design -- there was an incremental design change, and we thought, we'd be ableto rework our existing inventory to satisfy the customer requirements. As time went on, the customers made some additional incremental designchanges and we made a decision at the end of the year where we felt that it was going to be too costly to rework that inventory so we basicallyreserve for the remainder of that product.",True,False

And so next question just in terms of looking at the backlog here, the first that I'd have is, can you remindus -- as I think about your backlog and try to think about where the revenue opportunity is as we all have our models, say, for '18, what do youtypically see as a split in revenues that come through a quarter? What comes out of backlog versus what's typical book and ship? Is there a way tocharacterize that for each of your segments?

I wouldn't say all of it turns in the following quarter, but a large majority will turnin the following quarter because our lead times tend to be a little bit shorter there. In the connectivity segment, some of our -- some of these ordersare either in our aerospace or military applications, and those tend to be longer-term in nature. So I don't really have a good handle on how muchof our Q4 backlog will actually turn in the first quarter. And the Power and Protection segment, it's kind of -- that's kind of what's in the middle. Wehave a couple of large orders that are longer term in nature, but then we also have our, let's say, recurring orders, which would, again, kind of followin the same pattern as the magnetic.

And so last question here, and it's really kind of been the big topic for a while. It's been referenced a little bit in your preparedcomments, the Power business. What comments can you share with us in terms of understanding or thinking about or any incremental degree ofenthusiasm for finally getting a much more material uptick in that revenue generation? We've been waiting for a while as a lot that you've beendesigned into. You're getting good indicators through increases in backlog.

So we think we're pretty well in the bushes still to be honest. You look at ourbacklog. We do have a -- it went from, again, in 2015, if you just look at the Bel Power Solutions, which is a large part of the Power-One, it was $32.2million in 2015. Last year, it was $29.5 million. This year it's $34.4 million. So again, I think we have made some really good strides and good roads.What's really hurt us tremendously is the quality issues what we have at Facebook, where we think we addressed the issue properly and thensomething happened and we get pushed back. And you're talking about sales. That should run about $1 million a month. So we're looking at todaypossibly on that. We think it's fixed now, but we said that for other times. So I don't want to misuse it. But again, we can pick up $12 million fromFacebook get back to our normal run rate, which we think it's going to occur now in May. That definitely helps out everything we do. Again, wedo see a lot of good signs. We do see a lot of good things coming out of the data centers from doing our work at OCP. Again, but I -- until I see it,until I see consistent sales growth, I just don't want to hype it up. We are streamlining the organization a little bit more. We're taking $1 million ofcosts over the next 2 months at the group. So we know that, again, it's still a top priority of how do we turn around the top line growth.",True,False

We do have some bigopportunities in our modular group, where we do see -- it could be a possibly $10 million growth. We have (inaudible) for the product. We justdon't know because it's a retail product. We just don't know how it's going to be accepted in the field. So we see consistent growth with our Fusegroup. And then, of course, one of our large customers is Boeing, and we do a lot of work on the 737. So as they grow from 42 to 49 planes, wethink we see upswing there. Also with the military budget that we see a lot of strengthening with the Raytheons, the Honeywells and the Boeingdefense, those are opportunities that we can grow our business.

The problem that we facein our industry is that we've always -- our customers really are not concerned with price increases and labor whatever or what happens with coppernow or minimum material cost. They demand 2% or 3% price reductions twice a year. And the only way you really can get those costs to meetthose demands even with organic growth of 7.5%, you'll be treading water. And the only way you really can be successful is really growing the topline, knocking out, looking at acquisitions, taking out overhead and really running a lot more efficiently. I wish I could do it with organic growth.But to be honest, to see the demands that we have out there from our customers, at 7.5%, it helps, but it really doesn't get us where you have tobe.

But from a share standpoint, the relationships we have withour customers now, what we can offer our customers and a lot of intangibles is really strengthening overall relationship with our customers. Andfrom a power standpoint, one of the things that we never realized was when you are dealing -- generally, a lot of our products are commoditized.So a lot of times when we talk to our customers, it's price, price, price.

1650,64389927,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call,Ira M. Birns,World Fuel Services Corporation,"Thanks, Mike. And good evening, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted net income of $17 million in the fourth quarter. That's an increase of$2.7 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. And for the full year, adjusted net income was $127 million, a decrease of $20 millioncompared to 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.25 in the fourth quarter, up from $0.21 in the fourth quarter of last year. And full year adjusted dilutedearnings per share was $1.86 this year compared to $2.11 in 2016. For the past several years, we have provided 2 or often 3 income and EPS measures: GAAP; adjusted GAAP, which simply adds back nonrecurringcharges and; non-GAAP, which additionally, adds back intangible amortization and stock-based compensation. We've received feedback from investors that this has been cumbersome and confusing. So effective this quarter, we have simplified such reporting.We are now only reporting GAAP and adjusted GAAP. Intangible amortization and stock-based compensation information will always be availableon our public filings for those who find such information useful for modeling purposes. At the same time, we will now regularly report adjusted EBITDA, which we find to be a very meaningful measure of our operating results and growthas well as a common valuation metric. For this reason, we are more closely focused on this metric and looking to drive significant year-over-yearimprovements. Now onto the detailed review of the financial statements. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $8.9 billion, up 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was principally due tothe significant increase in oil prices compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year, revenue was $33.7 billion, an increase of $6.7 billion or 25% compared to 2016. Our aviation segment volume was 2 billion gallons in the fourth quarter, up approximately 130 million gallons or 7% year-over-year. Volume growthin our aviation segment was derived, principally from gains in our core resale operations in North America and EMEA as well as sales coming fromour acquired international physical fueling operations compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. And for the full year, aviation volume was 7.9 billiongallons, up 800 million gallons or 11% year-over-year. Volume in our marine segment for the fourth quarter was 6.1 million metric tons, down approximately 1.5 million metric tons or 20% year-over-year.The largest drivers of the volume reduction relate to our operations in the Asia-Pac region and our decision to exit certain markets, we have seencontinued market pressure and weakness as well as our conscious efforts to reduce activity in regions where we have not been achieving satisfactoryreturns on capital. While some of these efforts impacted profitability in the fourth quarter, they directly contributed to our strong cash flow performance. For the fullyear, volume in our marine segment was 26.5 million metric tons, down 4.8 million metric tons or 15% year-over-year. This decline principallyrelated to the previously mentioned decisions to exit markets or scale-down certain activities. Our land segment volumes was 1.5 billion gallons during the fourth quarter, effectively flat with the fourth quarter of the prior year. And for thefull year, volume in the land segment was 5.9 billion gallons, that's an increase of 600 million gallons or 11% year-over-year.     We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and generating consistently healthy cash flows as we have done for the past severalyears. While 2017 was a challenging year for us, we started taking important steps towards driving meaningful change throughout the organization.We are building a more efficient operating model, which should facilitate greater opportunities, both organic and strategic investments. With theobjective of driving solid cash flows and improved operating results in 2018 and beyond. I will now turn the call back to over to Mike who has some additional remarks.",False,True
1651,64389927,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call,Michael J. Kasbar,World Fuel Services Corporation,"Thank you, Ira. If we look back at the origins of our business our roots were in creating value as a reseller in fragmented markets through price,location, credit and information arbitrage. It seemed like one big endless summer where we were looking for the next big waves of value to themarketplace at the time, and of course, gross profit. Cost really wasn't a critical part of the equation within that simple business model. Today, almost everything has changed in energy, finance,information and technology. Now we have shale oil and shale gas. We rode that constrained crude oil while it lasted in North Dakota, but that camecrashing down. We have low cost of money, low price, ample supply of almost everything and a highly transparent and consolidated marketplace. Our value proposition is now increasingly as a specialized distribution and service network, providing comprehensive and easily accessible solutions.Low cost and scalability are key as is the right mix of activities to serve a more demanding customer and competitive marketplace. As such, the 3 pillars around which everything we do revolves are: one, a continuous cost management culture; two, a disciplined sharpening ofthe portfolio; and three, driving aggressive organic growth complemented with selective acquisitions. Of course, an intense focus on the market, talent and culture is foundational for any successful organization. Our approach to cost managementis comprised of utilizing a digital and agile business team methodology to leapfrog manual processes and accelerate the integration of people andapproved processes in problem-solving. The nature of work is changing, and so are we. We have started to restructure parts of our business, utilizing this approach. Telemetry, telematics, logistics, optimization, increased spans andreduced layers, collocation, shared service centers, empowered end-to-end agile teams, consolidated procurement, elimination of data centersand aggressively moving to cloud-based solutions will over time materially change our cost structure. We are at the early stages of this process,but expect material impact over the next 24 months. In 2017, we exited our rail C-Store of small-scale LNG joint venture and a low return distributor program and are aggressively reviewing all discreteactivities to test for return, runway and relevance to our markets and vision. Our diversified aviation services network and distribution platform continues to perform well and is a model for land and marine. Our rightsizedmarine business should yield better returns and is poised in the longer term to capitalize on the continuing need in the market for a comprehensiveservice and distribution partner. We are well positioned to provide any solution for 2020 when low sulphur regulations commence. Our land business should perform better in 2018 as we transition the business mix on the East Coast from a wholesale to retail recurring revenuemodel and drive efficiencies in the U.K. and U.S. platforms. The North American market, which represents around 21% of global liquid-energy demand, is attractive to grow and leverages our maturingorganization and the appeal of tax reform. We fully expect our Kinect Energy Group will deliver a material EBITDA run rate by 12/19. This is a sizableand growing market and we are committed to grow organically and through strategic investments. Multi Service growth is accelerating. We remain bullish about its prospects for using its specialized expertise to solve complicated business problemswith payments as well as driving synergies across our global platform.     To drive growth across our enormous population of existing and potential customers, with a broad product and service offering across an enviablegeography, we are embarking on an aggressive zero-touch enterprise deployment of Salesforce.com, which will be fully installed in 2018. Weexpect this initiative to be transformational in itself. The market has transformed significantly and technology will continue to change almost everything we do. We are leveraging the world's besttechnology partners to accelerate our transformation and create greater value in the markets we serve. It's certainly a time of tremendous change, when our organization has a burning desire to leverage our broad energy, logistics and FinTech capabilityusing exciting new tools and methodologies to continuously manage cost, sharpen our portfolio and drive growth with an exceptionally valuableset of product services and integrated solutions.

1653,64389927,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call,Kenneth Scott Hoexter,"BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Looks like, I guess, you've made about 17 or up to 20 acquisitions over the past decade. Today, we're hearing a lot about trimming, I guess, costcuts, trimming charges. Is there still more integration that you need to occur here? Maybe you can take a step back, Michael, it sounded like youwant to take a step back and talk about kind of what you started as, are there too many disparate businesses here? Or do you still feel like you'veheaded in the right direction with these acquisitions now that you are stepping back with the cost-cutting program?",True,False
1654,64389927,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call,Michael J. Kasbar,World Fuel Services Corporation,"Listen, I think that -- I don't really have any regrets. All the businesses we bought were good businesses with good people. I think if I had to turnthe clock back, I'd do a couple of different things because I think we were taking intelligent diversification steps. I think I would have dropped somepeople and done it a little bit different. I think we are a lot smarter now in terms of how to acquire, how to integrate cultures, brands, technology.We sort of left the folks alone, we left the technology alone and now we've got I think a much stronger view on how to move a lot more quickly.Technology is the name of the game. And within our U.S. land platform, we've got a disparate number of systems. We are moving them to thecloud, which will accelerate our ability to deal with that. Jeff Smith, obviously, is going to be instrumental in doing that. And with Kinect, massiveamount of data. I mean Kinect alone has 30 terabytes themselves, so incredibly data intensive business. So the technology side of it is crucial. Idon't want to say it's the name of the game with growing businesses, but it's a big, big part of it and we're not really where we need to go. So that'ssomething that we have to move very quickly on. Mike Crosby on the land side and his team I think are doing an excellent job in the U.S. We'reoptimistic and bullish in terms of our ability to bring that together and brand that properly. So I feel good about what we're doing. We definitely-- cost is a whole different ballgame today. It's not an event. It's something that is continuous. So we're serious about it. We have an outside view.We have outside people helping us and teaching us some new tricks so it's important. It's very difficult and when you look at marine and aviation,obviously, marine has its own issues but we're working through them. If you look at aviation, they've got a platform. We spent a lot of time yearsago and created an end-to-end solution. So if you've got the people, the process and the technology and that is what allows them to scale. Wedon't exactly have that in land. Land is a conglomeration of a number of different businesses and systems and technologies and we're bringingthose together and as that comes together, and it is coming together, we're going to see a better result, a more predictable result, recurring revenue.We went through debt commodity cycle. We started out exploiting the inefficiencies in the marketplace. That was our first cycle. We rode thecommodity side. Q4 of '14, Q1 of '15 it came crashing down. We should have pivoted faster, but okay, it is what it is. And now we're smarter andit's hedged down to basically go after that.",True,False

Ira, you talked about bidding back for NCS. Maybe you can talk a little bit more about that? Obviously, I presume you viewit as still profitable, but why chase that business at that lower margins? Does that highlight how competitive the market has become? Or I guessas Michael keeps talking about on technology that others can provide this kind of service? And should we expect continual degradation of marginsgoing forward on new business given that contract renewal?",True,False

Kasbar,World Fuel Services Corporation,"So -- listen, we've been in the government business and government contracting business since the late '80s. And it's really helped our companytremendously. I've compared it to Formula One racing for passenger cars where you really have to deal with the contracting and logistics. It's seriousrequirements and it's really helped our company in its commercial activities. So that's a 2-year contract. And we'll have, obviously, the uncertaintiesof what the volume may be, but that is a contract. So that margin shouldn't change. But we'll continue to develop our capability. We already areexpanding that in different geographies and taking it wherever -- different governments have an interest in our contracting and logistics capabilities.So we don't -- that margin is locked in for at least 2 years within the possibility of extensions.",True,False

So as Iracommented in his script, we've got an excellent relationship with them and we've got a fantastic reputation for performance. So it's an importantpart of our area -- of our business and we leverage that within our commercial area, I think I mentioned with the ExxonMobil acquisition, we'd usethe physical logistics competencies of our military personnel to handle those interplain deliveries in those 7 countries around the world.

1662,64389927,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call,Kevin Wallace Sterling,"Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division","So the marine volumes we saw in Q4 '17, should we expect something similar in the first quarter of '18?

1663,64389927,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call,Michael J. Kasbar,World Fuel Services Corporation,"I don't know if we have more markets to exit. We're being mindful of returns. So there has been some changes that is not a surprise to folks thathave been following the marine business. We're looking as I said to model our physical business. I think aviation has it right in terms of the third-party,the inventory, the distribution, the technology side of it. So it's certainly not in a robust place. So if we can't get the returns then we're going to befocused on that financial discipline. We certainly want to support our clients and we're still committed to the space. So I don't see -- I don't thinkwe see growth in volume -- aggressive growth in volume. So I'd say it's more likely to be flat.",True,False
1664,64389927,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call,Kevin Wallace Sterling,"Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. That helps. And as you've exited those marine markets, are you deploying those resources elsewhere?",True,False

1666,64389927,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call,Kevin Wallace Sterling,"Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. Ira, looks like you guys paid down a good chunk of debt in the quarter. Do you expect to continue to delever in 2018? Is that the plan?",True,False
1667,64389927,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call,Ira M. Birns,World Fuel Services Corporation,"Assuming that -- we've already pretty much paid down all the debt we could with the cash that became available to us because of the tax reform.We've got a pretty good track record. We have an excellent track record of consistently generating operating free cash flow year in, year out. Youmay note that interestingly enough, we generated the exact same amount of operating cash flow in '17 as we did in '16 by coincidence. So to theextent we continue to do that, we can now more likely use that cash to delever further, assuming prices stay in the same ballpark. As of course, ifprices move up, that may require some more capital or if we decide to go after some of the strategic opportunities that are in the pipeline thatremains very robust for us. Obviously, we use some cash there too. So depends on a few factors. But the cool thing now, Kevin, is that we couldhave generated a lot of cash in a given quarter but historically if it was all generated overseas, we couldn't use any of the cash to delever. So whiletax reform is quite likely hurting us on the tax rate side, it's giving us a lot more flexibility to move capital around where we need it and keep debtat the lowest levels possible. So we've always had a grossed up balance sheet, if you will, with hundreds of millions of cash and then a larger sumof debt. Those days are fortunately over. We'll still hold onto some cash on our balance sheet to cover our day-to-day business, but we don't needto cover -- to carry any more than that anymore. So that's as I said in my script if we are making investments, tax reform and a lower corporate taxrate in the U.S. makes U.S. investments a lot more attractive.

Certainly, land, as I've said this before, it's a very sizable market. Our intention obviously is to build density, particularly when you're in adistribution business, that's critically important. We have perhaps a unique feature of that, we have a global network. There aren't too many folksin the world that have our spread of geography where we truly understand the markets and certainly the distillate markets by virtue of our jet fuelin so many different countries. So we're still bullish on going global. Our Kinect business is truly a global business and Marine and aviation. MultiService is active in more and more countries. Their clients look to take them in more countries. So -- any case, land is certainly sizable. I'd love toacquire within the FinTech space with Multi Service, if had to turn the clock back, we would have bought 3, 4, 5 companies within that and bulkthat business up. Kinect, we feel very bullish about in that area. Marine, it's interesting, we feel like we could look at that many number of differentways. And aviation, still has a good amount of runway in it. We're happy with all of the acquisitions we've done there. And I think, if you want tolook at it and going back to Ken's question, having a platform makes all the difference. And so, we are getting a lot more serious about our landplatform. It's very high on our list of priorities that kind of tough to really get the value out of businesses if you can't do the plug-and-play. But now,you made me give you a long answer, Kevin. But in any case, there is no shortage in organic growth opportunities that are intelligent when youlook at our business, we have a fairly broad chassis. We've got a broad geography. So our opportunity for growth and profitable growth is good,but we have to do a couple of things before we could do that, the right way, we're building it step-by-step.",True,False

I like your long answers, it's good detail for me. Another point, and if I'm remembering correctly, a few years ago, I remember, you guyshad a similar issue you had in aviation this quarter, where I think at the end of the quarter, fuel spiked and you kind of got caught on the wrongside and your hedges didn't work. Am I thinking about that right? I think it's happened to you before. And then point number two, do you still --is it black oil futures you sold as your hedge against jet fuel inventory?",True,False
1675,64389927,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 World Fuel Services Corp Earnings Call,Ira M. Birns,World Fuel Services Corporation,"It's heating oil. So historically, heating oil and jet fuel are very tightly correlated and heating oil is the liquid market to hedge because there's noreal liquid market to hedge jet fuel directly. What you're referring to, Kevin, is true. It's actually happened several times in the 10, 11 years that I'vebeen here. And it's not that the hedges didn't work, at least the $7 million item that I referred to. It's simply because of the inventory methodologywe utilized, we wind up with hedges that are intended to cover our risk being on the wrong side because in this example, prices spike. The assumptionis that you're covering your risk from prices going down and your inventory being valued too high when you're trying to sell it off to customers.This is the opposite side, so the assumption is that you've got some extra profit on your inventory.

I'd like to start by commenting on 2017's fourth quarter and full year results, and ouroutlook on the overall market, and then I'll turn it over to our CFO, Joel Hatlen for more detail on the numbers, including some more detail specificson the recent tax law changes and their impact to Data I/O. 2017 fourth quarter highlights include $7.6 million in bookings which represent an 11-year high for us in the fourth quarter. Revenues were $8.1million, another multiyear high for us in the fourth quarter. We had continued strength in our automotive and programming center segments, andalso realized our first revenue from the SentriX security provisioning platform. Once again, our operations delivered a very strong performance,     We're continuing to see automation replacing manual programming in most global markets. This is driven by labor costs, reduced component sizeand increasing quality demands worldwide. We're investing in software and systems integration capabilities to accelerate the move to automationand support major global initiatives, such as Industry 4.0 and the China Smart Factory. For our 2018 growth outlook, we see signs that our largest programming center customers are still absorbing capacity purchase last year and willnot be adding new capacity at the same rate as the past 2 years. The test industry, which may also provide some useful comparisons, is forecasting a moderation of growth as well in 2018. Furthermore, we sawa return to more seasonal patterns at the end of Q4 and the start of 2018, and our order patterns can be lumpy from time to time. We start the yearwith about $4 million in backlog and we anticipate the systems in backlog will become revenue in 2018. We also expect gross margins this yearwill remain in the mid-to-high 50% range, depending on revenue mix, factory utilization and sales channels. We expect an increase in our overall spending, primarily in R&D and marketing, to support our automotive and Managed and Secure Programminginitiatives. At the same time, we remain vigilant in looking at ways to reduce our ongoing operating costs. We have kicked off internal programsto reduce material COGS by another $500,000 over the next 2 years, with some of that benefit planned for 2018. We start the year with over $18million in cash and no debt. As it was discussed on my blog at www.dataio.com, 2018 will be the year of security and the year the UFS starts the transition in automotiveelectronics. We plan to extend our lead in both. I'd like to now turn over the call to Joel Hatlen, to discuss our -- in more detail the numbers. Joel?",False,True
1679,64400116,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Data I/O Corp Earnings Call,Joel S. Hatlen,Data I/O Corporation,"Thank you, Anthony. Good day, everyone. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $8.1 million as compared with $6.4 million for theperiod last year. As Anthony noted, the 26% year-over-year increase was primarily a result of automotive electronics demands from both OEM andprogramming centers, primarily related to our PSV family of programming systems. Revenues from adapters increased $212,000, or 14% from theyear-earlier period. Total revenue was comprised of capital equipment, 70%; adapters, 22% and software, 8% in the fourth quarter. On a geographicbasis, international revenue represented approximately 92% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with 88% in the fourthquarter of 2016. Revenue growth was the strongest in the Americas, which increased 59% from the prior year. In Europe, revenue grew by 24%year-over-year while Asia experienced a 12% increase. Order bookings were $7.6 million in the fourth quarter, which is an 11-year high for thecompany, and an increase of 4% from the same period of the prior year. The variation in revenue percentages versus order percentages relate tochanges in backlog, deferred revenues and currency translation. Data I/O had $1.8 million in deferred revenue at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.6 million at the end of the third quarter, andcompared to $1.9 million at the end of the prior year. Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4 million compared to $4.6 million atthe end of the third quarter of 2017, and $3.2 million at prior year end. For the fourth quarter of 2017, gross margin, as a percentage of sales, was 58.5% compared to 56.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increasewas primarily due to sales volume, which resulted in better fact -- fixed factory cost utilization, along with a favorable product mix, a favorablechannel mix, and reduced unfavorable factory variances. Throughout the year, our manufacturing teams in both Redmond and China continuedto demonstrate operational excellence in execution in a virtually investment-free delivery of increases in capacity during the year. Operation -- operating expenses were $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $3 million in the same period of 2016. The increasewas due to additional engineering and R&D spending of approximately $356,000 associated primarily with our new security provisioning or SentriXplatform, and other automotive-related technology innovations. R&D increased 25% for the fourth quarter year-over-year, although as a percentageof sales, the expense category was marginally lower. Sales and marketing expenses increased $204,000, or 27% for the fourth quarter year-over-year,which reflects higher sales levels as well as our heightened efforts in promoting our new security provisioning solution. Included in sales andmarketing are variable incentives, sales and commission compensation, along with additional trade show and other marketing activities.     year-end accrued incentive compensation, 401(k) matching contributions. The company remains debt-free and had 8,276,813 shares outstandingat December 31st of 2017. With that, I'll turn the call back to Anthony.",False,True

We even kicked off a program internally called Automotive First to alignour processes top to bottom to being very successful on automotive, and growing 126% or so in a couple of years, I think, shows we had our eyeon the right market there. Everything that I read and see and talk to our customers about indicates that the fundamental long-term trends inautomotive are still present. They need more flash memory across the car. Mercedes-Benz highlighted this at an investor and technology eventlast summer, where they talked about getting to 1 terabyte per car by 2025. I've seen numbers even double that number. You back that out, youget about a 30% compounded annual growth rate in the flash demand in a car. We've talked about the Internet of Things, security markets, talking     about authentication ICs growing as well as a new category of products called secure microcontrollers. There's been some new research publishedthere by a company called ABI out of the U.K., and that's where we get our 4 billion unit TAM in about 5 years. You've also seen some of theannouncements and relationships we've made. Recently, including this week, we'll also have additional announcements to make around EmbeddedWorld, so stay tuned to the channel. So we've hitched our wagon to those 2 markets long term. And so that's where we're bullish.

1690,64400116,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Data I/O Corp Earnings Call,James Anderson,"R.F. Lafferty & Co., Inc., Research Division",I had a question about the cash position of the company. You guys seem to be pretty heavily cash flow-positive at this point and are accumulatingquite a hefty amount of cash at $18.5 million.

Hatlen,Data I/O Corporation,"Joel, I guess I wanted to say to start off by saying that I'm really pleased at our cash level. But we believe that we actually collect receivables andliquidated inventory much better than we traditionally have been able to do, so I'm expecting that we'll have to deploy some more cash as workingcapital. The other piece is we do have fairly hefty amounts of accrued expenses that we're reading into year-end incentives and accrued pensionand things like that. So I'm expecting a couple of million dollars to go out in the first quarter relating to that in particular. So -- but beyond that, wewouldn't really comment with regard to our planned uses of cash until we actually have something to say.",True,False

And then on the NOLs, with the $13 million of American NOLs, can you guys give any color on how you plan to use it?

Hatlen,Data I/O Corporation,"I'm not sure if I exactly know how to answer this question but the answer from my standpoint is that we continue to expect that we will use NOLsto offset our income, and we will continue to have similar taxes being generated in our foreign subsidiaries. So we'll have a continued blended taxrate as a result. We now no longer have the alternative minimum tax, which has driven part of our U.S. taxes in the past. So that's going to besomething good. We have not figured out too much how the GILTI or other international tax things from tax reform really are going to impact our2018 results yet. So that's a wait to come, and we'll talk about that more at the first quarter results.",True,False
1694,64400116,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Data I/O Corp Earnings Call,James Anderson,"R.F. Lafferty & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And with the development of the UFS flash capabilities, you mentioned that you'd seen some interest from your customers. Obviously, youguys do business with the top automotive manufacturers. Can you give a little bit more color on what that's been like, on their interest level?",True,False
1695,64400116,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Data I/O Corp Earnings Call,Anthony Ambrose,Data I/O Corporation,"Sure, James. So when you look at it -- just step back so the -- without getting into too much on technology -- the memory market for the technologyis used in a lot of infotainment, navigation systems, things like that in cars that tend to be the big consumers of flash capacity. They've used thetechnology interface, which is called eMMC. It's just the abbreviation for the current technology standard. The new technology standard is calledUFS. And so you're beginning to see new designs look at UFS. And this is not something that happens overnight, nobody snaps their fingers andsuddenly everybody migrates. But UFS has some benefits, especially in terms of overall performance and I'll call it snappiness of the interface. Andso we would expect more automotive customers to be investigating that. We also are in constant discussion with memory companies about whatthey think their marketing mix is going to be. And obviously, they have a pretty good idea of what they're going to sell. So over time, I think you'llsee the migration to UFS. It's very important for us to be out in the market now, because as customers go in their early designs and take monthsto take a design from production -- sorry, early production to pilot production to full production -- we can be there with them the whole step ofthe way or every step of the way with their design process. So we like the technology. We're very happy to have a product. We're very happy tohave earned our first customer in UFS, and we'll be there with the market for both eMMC and UFS solutions in automotive.",True,False

Lafferty & Co., Inc., Research Division","New products and rollouts, you mentioned that you're still sort of in the market development phase for the SentriX, IoTC -- the IoT secure provisioning.As the IoT marketplace develops that -- the need for security will become apparent fairly quickly and then, as a result, the SentriX's demand will befueled by that. Can you give us a little bit more of an idea of how we should expect SentriX to affect revenue in 2018? Or is that something weshould be looking at for 2019?",True,False
1697,64400116,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Data I/O Corp Earnings Call,Anthony Ambrose,Data I/O Corporation,"That's a good point. The -- so if we look at SentriX, what we're doing is we're giving customers the opportunity to provision the security credentialsinto their products one unit at a time. What that effectively means is that they can take a technology that's very useful today in things like smartcards or cellular phones, and now they can deploy that key and certificate technology into IoT devices. The way that works is each semiconductorcompany lets you put those keys and certificates in, in slightly different ways. So what we've been doing, at first, is to work with the leading suppliersin these markets for authentication ICs and secure microcontrollers to make sure that we support their products. And it's substantially more complexto do that support than it is for a data-only programming support. Given that and given that there is some new products coming out -- and I'dencourage all of you to look and see what comes out of Embedded World next week in the silicone industry -- we're well positioned with thosefirms in the silicon space, but they have to go get design wins and began shipping products to their customers. And the embedded cycles are justanywhere between 6 and 18 months.

Throughout 2017, I reported that we had steady demand and that led to a record leasing year. Thus far in the first quarter of 2018, we continue tosee steady demand. We feel really good about our differentiated product type, our price points, our locations and the brokers and tenants we are attracting. On today's call, I will provide you with an update on our 4 key growth drivers. Review our leasing activity in the fourth quarter and full year, givean overview of our current and future space availabilities and discuss some of our recent redevelopment work. To make things easier and cut the length of these calls, certain areas of my quarterly update can now be found in our supplemental. Our fourth quarter numbers reflect further progress on our 4 long-term growth drivers, which are one, upside from signed leases not commencedof $17 million and burn off of free rent of $26 million, which together, total approximately $43 million of contracted growth. Two, lease up ofdeveloped vacant office space of $26 million; three, the mark-to-market on our expiring Manhattan office leases of $18 million; and four, themark-to-market and lease-up of available retail space of $10 million. Based on these updated numbers, we estimate these drivers will contribute approximately $97 million of revenue growth over the next 5 to 6 yearsDecember 31, 2017. Relative to our trailing 12 months cash NOI of $381 million.     Turning to our retail business. We signed a significantly lease with T.J. Maxx for a 19,000 square-foot full floor expansion and overall lease extensionat 250 West 57th Street during the fourth quarter, and T.J. Maxx now leases a total of 47,000 square feet. Our street retail portfolio located in high-traffic areas with excellent -- within excellent submarkets is 92% occupied and 93.9% leased and strongexecution on leasing results delivered by our team has positioned us well with only 8% of our retail spaces expiring in the next 2 years. As previously announced at the Empire State building. For the first time since the buildings opening, a gut redevelopment of all retail space isunderway. The first phase on 33rd Street has been successfully completed, will be vacated and 100% released approximately 21,000 square feet at grade and9,200 square feet on the second floor to Walgreens, Juice Press, Starbucks, Sushi-teria, Chopped, STATE Grill and Bar and most recently Tacombi. Phase II on the 34th Street is in progress where we have vacant and are currently marketing 7,900 square feet on grade and 18,000 square feet ofcontiguous concourse space. By December 31 of 2019, we anticipate we will have another 6,700 square feet at grade, 12,000 square feet on concourse and 5,000 square feet onthe second floor vacant for redevelopment. As we have stated before, our new 34th Street Observatory entrance will bring 4 million plus visitors annually, past our stores there and enhancethe value of all of our 34th Street retail space. We remain very confident about our leasing pipeline and in our team's ability to execute.

For the fourth quarter, we reported Core FFO of $74.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Cash NOI was $99.7 million, up 2.5% from the prior-year period. For the full year 2017, Core FFO was $286.9 million or $0.96 per diluted share, which includes approximately $0.045 per diluted share of leasetermination income. This was partially offset by the right-off of straight line rent receivables associated with the terminated leases of approximately$0.05 per share. And of course we have reduction in rental revenue from these terminated leases until such time as revenue commences onreplacement leases. Cash NOI was $381 million, up 7% from the prior-year period. In the first quarter of 2017, we changed our revenue recognition practices for leases in which the tenant constructs tenant improvements in whichwe share the funding obligation. We recognize rental revenue at the earlier of cash rent commencement or completion of tenant improvements.     Against this as detailed in the supplemental on Page 6, we had $17 million of signed leases not commenced of which we expect $800,000 to berealized in 2018 revenue with an additional $10 million in 2019 and an additional $6 million in 2020. Further, we have $26 million of annualized free rent of which $13 million will be realized in 2018 with the majority of the balance in 2019. Consistent with what we have always said and what you have heard from the team today, the additional vacancy and the impact on revenue in2018 is inherent in our strategic plan to deliver embedded derisk growth and shareholder value.

As I look back, I'm very happy withwhat we have accomplished. We've done exactly what we have said we would do since inception. We have vacated and modernized the New Yorkportfolio for the 21st century, redeveloped our spaces and leased at outsized spreads to better tenants on longer lease terms at higher rents. Weare differentiated from our peers and our markets and in our segment. We have delivered outsized growth through our embedded, deriskedopportunities within our portfolio.

And that wehave seen capital markets deploy capital at what we think are much lower IRR's let alone ROIs. So I do think that with this redevelopment opportunity,look, we've seen many landlords today not improve their buildings or may be put in a new lobby instead of doing anything fairly fundamental.And lease frankly, to secondary tenants at lower rents and give away much higher concession packages. And we don't think that, that is a goodstrategy. However, when you look at their balance sheets particularly some of the public ones, they're not in a position really to do more. That'swhat they can afford to do. And I think that there are probably people in the private market who will be looking at that as well. It's difficult to payvery high prices and then have money set aside to do meaningful upgrades to the buildings. End of story. So our hope is that we have higherinterest rates with people less able to plow on leverage, with the skills needed in order to do this kind of work that, that will all combine to ourbenefit from a competitive perspective and also right down to our benefit from a potential yield perspective.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Dorvin.",False,True
1767,64390002,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,Dorvin Donald Lively,"Planet Fitness, Inc.","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing the details of our fourth quarter results, highlights from 2017 and then discussour full year 2018 outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2017, total revenue increased 15.1% to $134 million from $116.4 million in the prior year period. Total system-widesame-store sales increased 11.6%. From a segment perspective, franchisee same-store sales increased 11.9%, and our corporate store same-storesales increased 5.6%. Over 90% of our Q4 comp increase was driven by net member growth with the balance being rate growth. The increase inpricing was driven by 90 basis points increase in our Black Card penetration to 59.8% compared with last year, combined with a $2 increase in BlackCard pricing for new joins that we've put in place system wide on October 1. During the quarter, the increased Black Card pricing drove approximately60 basis points of the increased same-store sales. Our Franchise segment revenue was $40 million, an increase of 24.6% from $32.1 million in the prior year period. Let me break down the driversof our fastest growing revenue segment. Royalty revenue was $27.1 million, which consists of royalties on monthly membership dues and annualmembership fees. This compares to royalty revenue of $17.5 million in the same quarter of last year, an increase of 54.8%. This year-over-yearincrease had 3 drivers: First, we opened 206 new franchise stores since the fourth quarter of last year; Second, as I mentioned, our franchisee-ownedsame-store sales increased by 11.9%; and then third, a higher overall average royalty rate. For the fourth quarter, the average royalty rate was 4.83%, up from 3.69% in the same period last year, driven by more stores at our current royaltyrate, including stores that amended their franchise agreements. As we discussed on our last call, as of the end of Q3, approximately 400 stores hadamended their existing franchise agreements to increase their existing royalty rate by an additional 1.59% and at the same time, eliminate thecommissions they paid to us on certain operational purchases, thereby reducing those operating expenses. During Q4, approximately 500 additional stores amended their existing franchise agreements, which will further accelerate the increase in ouraverage royalty rate for 2018. However, it is important to remember that the increased royalty revenue that we'll receive due to the additional1.59% royalty rate change is being offset by a corresponding decline in commission income as we will no longer receive commission income onoperational expense purchases by these stores. I'll discuss our assumptions for future royalty rate growth later on in the call when I outline our2018 guidance. Next, our franchise and other fees were $6.4 million, an increase of 2.5% or $100,000 over the prior year period. These fees are received fromprocessing dues to our point-of-sale system, fees from online new member sign-ups as well as fees paid to us in association with new franchiseagreements, area development agreements as well as the sale and transfer of existing agreements. As many of you are aware, there are new GAAPrules on revenue recognition for contracts with customers, which would apply to our area development agreements and franchise agreementsthat went into effect January 1, 2018. In essence, we now need to recognize these fees related to both area development agreements and franchiseagreements over the life of the related franchise agreement, typically, 10 years, versus recognizing it all at once at the time a lease is signed for afranchise store location. This not only applies to all future ADAs and FAs but also certain existing agreements entered into post TSG's acquisitionof Planet Fitness in 2012. Under the accounting rules, you cannot go back prior to our acquisition to reestablish a deferred revenue componentprior to that date. Similar to the change in royalty rate, I'll walk you through these changes and how it impacts 2018 later in the call.     first year of the agreement for each franchise store opening and the remaining $27,000 in equal installments over the next 9 years. Helping topartially offset this headwind is the fact that we need to re-recognize the remaining portion of ADA and FA fees associated with existing agreementssigned since 2012, which were reestablished on our balance sheet as deferred revenue. We recognized approximately $6.8 million for these relatedfees in 2017 under the prior old GAAP rules. If we had been under the current 2018 GAAP rules, we would have recognized $1.2 million. In 2018,under current GAAP, we anticipate to recognize approximately $2.3 million, but as I stated earlier, approximately $4 million less than reported in2017, which under previous GAAP, would have dropped to the bottom line of our P&L. In terms of profitability, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth to increase in the mid-teens percentage range. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPSis projected to increase by approximately 40%. This guidance assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 25% to 26%, which includes the newfederal, state and local rate following the recent tax reform. As a comparison to the prior year and before the tax reform act rate reductions, adjustednet income and adjusted EPS would have grown by approximately 20%. We plan to reinvest a portion of our tax savings back into the business in 2018, primarily in infrastructure and technology for our stores and systemsto ensure Planet Fitness is well positioned to capitalize on the current industry trends in order to benefit our business and enhance the memberexperience. These investments, which are estimated to be in the $7 million to $8 million range, are in addition to the CapEx spend already outlined. The following are the assumptions used in developing our full year guidance. First, with respect to sales, system-wide same-store sales are expectedto increase in the high single-digit percentage range. We were also expecting to sell and place equipment in approximately 190 to 200 new stores,again, this year and anticipate replacement equipment sales to be approximately 40% of total equipment sales. Also, I want to point out that ourEPS guidance doesn't include any potential future share repurchases. Finally, based on the approximately 900 stores that have amended their existing franchise agreements and increased their royalty rate by 1.59%as of December 31, 2017, coupled with the new stores opening up at the current rate, we expect the average royalty rate to increase approximately125 basis points in 2018. The majority of this increase being the estimated impact of stores amending their franchise agreements with a correspondingdecrease in commission income. I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions.",False,True

As you're building in more markets and you've had really impressive unitgrowth, how are the unit economics trending? And then as we look ahead with the national marketing budget, it's been a real powerful part ofyour story. How would you expect that dollar amount to trend on a long-term basis as it's quite an important part of what's been driving a lot ofthe awareness?

In terms of new stores, the way we look at our new stores, we look at them by class year. We look at them in the months they open.And as you see from our same-store sales we've talked about in the past that new stores tend to drive a fairly high percentage of the comps. Thefirst year in comp, kind of year 2 in operation, they're going to comp at, call it, 40% to 50%. Your second year is going to be in kind of that 20%,25% range. And then once you get into the fourth year and older, they tend to be in the kind of the mid-single-digit range. Those are still very     similar in terms of stores that we opened in 2017 from an EFT perspective, from a same-store sales perspective, very similar to our previous vintageyears.",True,False

I think as far as the marketing standpoint, New Year's Eve again kicked it off. This is our third year, we auto renew foran additional 2 years to that contract. So that's already done. Unaided brand awareness, as I mentioned, aided is the all-time high. We had dethronedGold's Gym the first year we did that, so ever since then, we've been #1, which I think is, again, continuing to drive these comps. What we're seeingis that this marketing budget isn't static. It continues to grow with each new member. So 1.7 million members added net new last year is allincremental marketing dollars that continues to fund this year. So I think is what we've seen is that momentum we're driving and a lot of thedata-driven decisions that we're using to formulate our marketing continue to drive those comps.",True,False

We just put them in fourth quarter, 15 sites, 5 of each of the 3 manufacturer sites. One,unfortunately, is yet to be put in, which will be shortly here. There's a delay in construction. It's still early, so we're cautious with that. But what I willsay and that being said is the early read on the early data is they are driving more White Card upgrades than their peers, peer clubs and driving alittle more usage than their peer clubs. So -- and evidently, people like running through New Zealand. So it's interesting to be able to -- I mean,we're doing this for 25 years, Oliver, honestly and to be able to now actually know the habits of our members and to be able to see an increase inhandful of experiences based on the -- what we've learn is just something that this industry has never seen, and we're in the forefront of figuringthat out.",True,False

So the -- when it comes to the premium consoles and all the technology side, it really comes down to that complete ecosystem, which I talkedabout in the past that we never had, neither did the industry. And I think when we work with these manufacturers of the equipment, which we'rein the process of is how do we enhance the member's experience, tee that data up back to the member so that they know what they did and howto then, with algorithms, figure out what they should do tomorrow. When you think about all the wearables and apps out there, a lot of them track.Not many recommend, and that's really the missing link, is what people need to do tomorrow to get their fitness journey started and to get results.So -- and then capturing that data, how do we use that with insurance companies and corporations to show that their employees or subscribersare getting healthier and working out and then how do we use that for advertising purposes for other businesses that say we have these members,10 million members doing over 300 million workouts a year and how do we get them, what they're doing, what they like, what they not like, whattheir experiences are and how do we get the right products in front of them based on their likes and dislikes for advertising purposes.

1781,64390002,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,Dorvin Donald Lively,"Planet Fitness, Inc.",Yes. The $7 million to $8 million is going to be mostly CapEx. There's going to be a little bit of it that's going to be OpEx. But a good chunk of it willbe CapEx.,True,False
1782,64390002,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,John Edward Heinbockel,"Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then secondly, if you think about your pace of openings, is there still the idea here that you want to hold to that 200 or so becauseof what's happening on the real estate market? And is there any -- do you have any pushbacks from franchisees who want to grow faster, right,given the performance of their boxes and the brand awareness that's building, right? You would think you could go faster and pick up more share.Does the tension exist there or not really?",True,False
1783,64390002,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,Dorvin Donald Lively,"Planet Fitness, Inc.","No, there's really no tension. And in fact, I mean, there's a number of franchisees that are ahead of their development schedule, and we'll keepbuilding in terms of site availability. I guess, I'd go back and maybe address it a little bit as we've talked about in the past and I think you alludedto is that we still see significant favorability for us on the real estate site availability front. I mean, just the latest is Toys""R""Us and others that are outthere. And we don't see that doing anything but to continue to benefit us. And given that there's not a lot of retailers, particularly with the bigREITs that are spread out geographically, there's not a lot of other retailers that are taking down, call it, a couple hundred sites. So to me, the waywe look at it is that -- I mean, we're not holding them back, and we do have sites that we will not approve for a couple reasons. One, we think thatmaybe the market is not developed to an extent that it's ready for that additional club that's going to be pulling members to that club; or second,we're -- we don't think the sites kind of Main and Main, and we want to be at Main and Main. And we believe and we're certainly seeing it that ifyou just hold on a little bit, some of those sites will become available. And then the third element, I would say, is that more and more franchiseesare doing ground-ups, and that's about an 18-month comp lag. And I mean, we have franchisees right now today that are out there doing ground-ups,and a couple of them are in the process right now. That won't open until probably early in '19 as an example. But we believe that 200 a year is,     we've called it, kind of labeled it thoughtful growth. We still think that's kind of the right number. But if we have franchisees that are bringing inmore sites in 2018 than they did in '17 and they're available sites that we think they should open, then we will approve them. But we really go atit from that angle. The last point I will make is we've had now more and more what I'd call top-down approach to whether it's Chris or myself orRob Sopkin, our Chief Development Officer, of meeting directly with REITs and then taking sites in their portfolio, one, that's either available nowor, two, that's coming up on lease expiration with the existing tenant in the next like 24 to 36 months. And we're starting to push those sites nowdown to the franchisees. We didn't do that 12, 18 months ago, and we're doing much more of that today.",True,False

It's an ever -- it's an evolution, and it will be as we learn and fine-tune over the years ahead of how we use it andhow we enhance member's experience.

But certainly today, to have the ability to pretty easily then link our systems in to some partnership with somebody on a loyalty programas an example, whereas, today, it would take us months, if not, years to be able to build something like that.

I mean, are you really beginning to see a certain type of store really rise to the top maybe in '16 and '17?

1801,64390002,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,Dorvin Donald Lively,"Planet Fitness, Inc.","Yes. I would say there's always outliers, John, a little bit. I mean, the extremes could be, say, a high urban area, is an example, corporate store inOakland, California over indexes in members and monthly EFT and certainly, EBITDA to more rural markets or markets outside of a metropolitanarea that might decile down a bit. We built a few more smaller stores in the last 12 months than we did the previous 12 months. And when I saysmaller, smaller on a square footage basis, not significantly but a little bit smaller. Sometimes that's because the only space you can get andsometimes it's because it's a little bit of a smaller market. But in terms of -- the way I look at it, John, is how our franchisees' portfolio doing, knowingthey're not going to hit a grand slam on every single one and knowing they might, to a certain extent, maybe do what we kind of call a fill-in toget a store into a market where you can -- you want to get one in there, maybe get it before the competition might get there. But it might be asmaller store. And it might be one that you might not even expect to be up to your kind of average. But from talking to our franchisees, looking atour corporate store portfolio, we opened 4 stores in Q4 last year, there's no major outliers out there. And with our Black Card percentage beingslightly higher with the $2 price point being higher, albeit it just started October 1 with new member sign-ups on the Black Card perspective, wecontinue to see very good profitabilities at the four-wall basis.",True,False

And certainly, a lot of systems that I covered, you have some different economic performance across geographies. I mean, it's alot of different reasons that markets can perform materially different from, if not, an average unit volume perspective but from a profitabilityperspective. Have you seen any real surprises, whether on the high side or on the low side that you're seeing as you're really -- you're kind ofcontinuing this fully national expansion?",True,False
1804,64390002,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,Dorvin Donald Lively,"Planet Fitness, Inc.","John, there really isn't any -- I mean, there are -- there -- the ends of the spectrum could be a higher urban area with higher rent that, for somereason, might not draw the higher volume to offset it. Many do. But whether you're in a Dallas, Chicago or Orlando, a Phoenix, a Denver, you goacross these different geographies where you might say the ethnicities in the market might be different. You might say the income levels mightbe different. The weather might be -- you can go through all those, and John, we really don't see that. Now as I said earlier, there's always outliersthat might perform a bit different but not in the kinds of percentages that ever worry us whatsoever. So what we see is that you will have somemore rural markets or smaller population markets. But then they typically have very low rents. And so you might have 10%, 15% less in membersbut you may be paying, instead of high teens or $20 square foot rent all in, you may be paying $5, $6 or $7. And so there are some of those markets     that actually generate a higher EBITDA in dollar wise than a store in another market that have more members and more EFT.

I think our operators are much better today than they've ever been, and I think that as they've gotten larger, they havegotten more sophisticated with their operations team and their marketing teams and real estate. I mean, you go back 4, 5 years ago, Rafe, we didn'thave hardly any of our franchisees that had a -- head of real estate, a CMO, a CFO and frankly, probably an operator outside of the franchisee.

1817,64390002,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,James Lloyd Hardiman,"Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I wanted to touch on the cash impact of tax reform. You gave us the impact that's going to have on your income statement, non-GAAP of 39.5%to maybe 25.5%. Maybe walk us through how your cash tax rate changes before and after tax reform and then the TRA impact if there is any. I knowthat's a delayed impact. Would you give us a schedule? Just curious how that schedule is going to change as a result of different tax rates. Andthen maybe talk a little bit about your franchisees, how tax reform is affecting them. I guess, I don't even know if they're mainly paying the corporaterate or if a lot of these guys are paying the pass-through rate. But ultimately, what do you expect them to do with those savings? And does any ofthat benefit you?",True,False
1818,64390002,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,Dorvin Donald Lively,"Planet Fitness, Inc.","Sure. So previous to the tax reform, our adjusted tax rate of, call it, 39% to 40% was based upon assuming all of our shares were Class A shares andall those shares -- so therefore, all of the income was taxed at the Planet Fitness, Inc. level. And today, we're roughly about, call it, 90%. 89%, 90%of our income is taxed at Planet Fitness, Inc. because we have about, call it, 10%, 11% of our shares are class B shares. So at a 39% to 40% tax rate,we were getting a tax deduction from the step-up basis from those stock sales, most of which were from TSG as they sold out. And we were getting     that benefit at, call it, $0.40 on the dollar. And of that $0.40 on the dollar, then which reduced our cash taxes to the government, 85% of thosesavings of that benefit went to the TRA holders, and then 15% of it stayed in the company. So the way I've always talked about it is think aboutthat our 39% tax rate was roughly because of the step-up -- we got about a 15% reduction off of that. So that was kind of the benefit to the companyby having this upstate tax structure in place. So now if you fast forward to, call it, 25%, 26% tax rate now with our Federal state and local tax ratethat we're estimating will be our full rate for 2018, now then those deductions, which that's why there was that huge deferred tax expense, whichI talked about that went through our P&L, is that we, in essence, then we remeasured that future benefit because it's no longer worth $0.40 on thedollar. It's only worth, call it, $0.25 on the dollar. But we'll be paying a lower cash tax rate using that 25%, 26%. So the way to think about it then isbecause that we will -- with the taxable income we have, albeit reduced by this tax basis deduction that we get at a 25% rate, we'll pay significantlyless in cash taxes to the IRS. But we'll still pay 85% of those savings at that 25% tax rate. We'll pay those to the TRA holders. So again, it's about a15% benefit to Planet Fitness, Inc. off of that 25% to 26% tax rate. So let me pause there and see if that is clear in the way that the -- kind of, inessence, cash taxes and the adjusted tax rates as I just walked through, if that makes sense.",True,False
1819,64390002,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,James Lloyd Hardiman,"Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","It does. But I guess bottom line it for me. From a free cash flow -- after-tax free cash flow, how is that being affected by the new rates?",True,False
1820,64390002,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,Dorvin Donald Lively,"Planet Fitness, Inc.","Yes. So if you look at our free cash flow, what you still have to look at is the TRA payment because it's not in your P&L because you're only taxed at,call it, a 25% tax rate on lower income because of the tax deduction. But you'll go to the cash flow statement, and you'll see a payment that goesto the TRA holders, albeit in the following year. So for example, in 2018, when we take a tax deduction that's only worth $0.25 on the dollar, I'llreduce my taxes that I pay throughout this year because you have to make quarterly payments. I'll pay less taxes to the IRS, so less cash taxes, andthen in 2019, I'll pay 85% of those savings out to the TRA holders. But that will go through the cash flow statement, and so you'll need to look, inessence, at free cash flow less the taxes paid under the tax benefit arrangement, i.e., the TRA.",True,False

1823,64390002,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,James Lloyd Hardiman,"Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then on the franchisee side, any thoughts there?",True,False
1824,64390002,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Planet Fitness Inc Earnings Call,Dorvin Donald Lively,"Planet Fitness, Inc.","Yes. I think a couple things is -- and obviously, we'll get this on a corporate basis as well, where capital assets outside of leaseholds, you'll get a100% deduction if they are placed in service. And so we'll get that as a corporate entity. And then a franchisee, whether they're a LLC entity or acorporate entity, will get immediate deduction of their CapEx assets less leaseholds. And then in addition, there's about 20% of their income thatis, if they're an LLC entity, that gets passed through at a 0 tax rate, subject to a limitation that's 50% of their W-2 wages. So the idea there, if you go     back and you think about what the Trump tax reform act did is it basically said we're going to incent you to invest in building assets and generatingjobs. In essence, that's what, I believe, they're doing by this immediate write-off of an asset. But they're saying that you -- what you got to do is yougot to be employing people. So if you employ people, you're paying them wages. So we're going to give you a 0 tax on 20% of your income butonly if you have W-2 wages. And so they put that limitation of 50% of your W-2 wages in there. So that's -- I don't know what percentage of thesedid, James, have LLCs. I'd say a fairly high percentage do, particularly the smaller guys. So I think the net of it is there is going to be incentive tobuild stores. There's going to be incentive to replace equipment with the stores that are coming up to -- that need to have their reequips done,and they'll be able to save taxes at the end of the day by doing so. So I -- net-net to our business from a franchisee perspective, I think it's positive,win-win.",True,False

1833,64388867,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Iridium Communications Inc Earnings Call,Matthew J. Desch,Iridium Communications Inc.,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Well we just completed a really great year, both in terms of our subscriber growth and the early successof our Iridium NEXT program. We're halfway through the launch program and the new satellite activations continue to go very well. To date wehave launched 40 satellites which represents 61% of the 66 new operational satellites we need for full service and we'll be launching the final 35satellites over the next few months to complete the constellation. Our NEXT Launch has moved around a bit, primarily due to the delays in the[Pause] Mission that should be launching this morning from Vandenberg. Right now, it looks like our NEXT launch will be the morning of Thursday,March 29, essentially 5 weeks from now, though we're still confirming that date. The 10 satellites for that launch are shipping to Vandenberg now     start for Iridium Certus than we originally expected, Certus is arguably one of the most anticipated global product launches for many of our existingand new partners in years. Our offering makes iridium a great standalone service or a perfect complement for KU and K-Band (inaudible) services,especially for distributors seeking to pair the Iridium Certus service with other technologies for safety and reliability. With maritime terminalsavailable in the second quarter, our VAMs and channel partners are actively promoting the service globally today. We announced our initial distribution partners for land mobile and maritime earlier this month and they are a strong group. We will also beannouncing our first aviation distribution partners very soon. Across all industry segments we have aligned with premier business partners whoare excited to roll out this broadband offering. We expect Iridium Certus to set a new benchmark for global L-Band services. Our enduring service to the US government is a great source of pride here at Iridium. Government subscribers grew 19% in 2017 illustrating thecontinued importance of Iridium voice and data services to the USG and we ended the year with a record 100,000 government subscribers. Ourlongstanding relationship with the US government has provided significant value for both of us. The government has enjoyed broader and morecost-effective use of Iridium's unique global services. Since our fixed price contract was initiated in 2013, the average cost per subscriber has fallenby 24% for the government, while its subscriber base has nearly doubled. We continue to engage in constructive dialogue with this valued partnerbut don't expect to have much to report on a new deal until it's completed either later this year or in 2019 if they choose to extend the currentcontract, the additional 6 months it allows. Aireon continued to make progress in singing new customers and addressing their capital funding needs as they move to commercial service.They signed 7 new MOUs in 2017 and earlier this year finalized a long-term data services contract with ASECNA, the air navigation service providermanaging traffic in 17 states in West Africa. We expect the company to announce additional meaningful data service contracts in the comingmoments. As you know, Aireon is creating a unique and powerful air traffic surveillance system that will revolutionize air traffic management. The FFA's andEurope's deadline for compliance with their ADS-B equipage mandates are less than 2 years away, and aircraft installations are accelerating. WithA&SPs managing the busiest North Atlantic tracts already signed up, along with 9 other ANSPs around the world, we are seeing the FFA continueits testing of the effectiveness of Aireon's satellite-based system. Most recently, the FAA and NavCanada each completed additional successfulflight tests on the growing number of new payloads in space. Aireon tells us the performance they are achieving is surpassing expectations,particularly with messages they've received from the test aircraft with very high fidelity. That's given Aireon and their customers a lot of confidencein the capability and quality of their service to provide better air traffic management around the world. Now on a final but very important note, we have made significant progress with our credit facility lenders that should take the topic of liquidity offthe table as we complete the iridium NEXT mission. Tom is going to go into this in more detail about the transaction. Needless to say, I'm reallypleased with this resolution and where it leaves us as we enter the home stretch on Iridium NEXT. Momentum is an appropriate word to describethe state of our business today. I'm very excited about the strong progress we made on launching Iridium NEXT this past year and seeing the energythat continues to fuel our business and operational success. 2018 is off to a great start. I feel very good about the underlying strength of our business,the new broadband services that we'll soon launch in the satellite industry, and our positioning, the ability to build new relationships with premierchannel partners that can drive incremental subscriber revenue for iridium. Even with the financial goals we have set this year, I am more confidentthan ever in our business prospects and my team's ability to deliver on these commitments as we complete the Iridium NEXT mission. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for a review of our financials. Tom?",False,True
1834,64388867,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Iridium Communications Inc Earnings Call,Thomas J. Fitzpatrick,Iridium Communications Inc.,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. With my remarks today, I'd like to start by summarizing Iridium's key financial metrics for the full yearand provide some color on the fourth quarter results. Then I'll walk through the 2018 financial targets we issued this morning, review our updatedlong-range guidance, and wrap up with a discussion of our liquidity position and recent activities there. We were pleased to deliver another year of good growth in 2017. Total service revenue grew 4% and operational EBITDA exceeded our full yearguidance, rising to $265.6 million. This performance was driven by continued momentum in IoT and in part field by acceleration of business with     plans, we can now complete the launch program with no concerns about liquidity. This expected debt raise would not materially impact our netleverage because the proceeds of the offering will pay down existing debt and the remainder will increase our cash balance. As of December 31, 2017, Iridium had a cash and marketable securities balance of approximately $298 million. We anticipate total capital spendingof approximately $500 million in 2018.

You know, it's really more around spectrum and applications that people provide. Sotoday, we compete with a GEO, a major GEO network today, and LEO, I mean excuse me, OneWeb, SpaceX, those are all KU and KA-Band providerswho really are going to compete for those commodity broadband applications that are currently what today's KU and K-Band GEO operations areinvolved in. So I look at those as potential partners. L-Band has a very unique place in the industry. It has a lot of advantages, particularly a globalone like us. For example, an easy example is on aircraft where L-Band is used primarily for cockpit operational communications for the airlines andKU K-Band is used in the cabin. When any kind of new networks come along, I think they're going to compete for the cabin but they really can't beregulated and provide servicing the cockpit. So it really doesn't change the competitive dynamics. SpaceX has a very interesting network. I knowthat they're going to take some time to develop it. I think that they are really going to compete against wire line and cable operations. They needto if they're going to generate the kind of revenues they has. So that's not our area.

I think it has almost everything to do with our latest view of how the market willramp up. Based upon the slightly later deployments of Certus than we originally hoped. When we originally provided that guidance, the broaderrange of guidance, we have expectations that there would be 40 to 50 satellites in operation sometime in late last year. And that Certus would beready and developed and tested and that we'd be really ramping throughout all of 2018 for Certus. And 2019 would be a big year. Now with thenumber of satellites we had in operation only now getting to here in the next month or two and Certus launching here in n the second quarter,it's going to be only a partial year in 2018 of ramp. And really more of the ramp is going to be start gathering momentum more in 2019. But we'renot -- we're happy with the devices that we've seen developed so far by our VAMs. We think they' are going to be really well received.

We've announced thosein the last couple of weeks, it's a great list. It's only the initial list, there will be more that we're announcing. I think you're going to be real pleasedwhen you see the aviation partners who are going to roll this out soon and that's an impressive list as well.

As you remember, we had some quality issueswith that a number of years ago. Those have by far been addressed to the extent that that product is, I hate to use the word bullet proof, but it'svery, very reliable and it's seen that way in the market right now. And we continue to have had strong shipments and kind of consistent netactivations each year for the last 2 or 3 years. Some of those, a number of those are standalone applications on what I'd call the value sort of platersthat look for instead of an always-on connection, really want to pay as they go. A lot of them are being installed as companion vehicles to VSATproviders to ensure they week where VDAT doesn't work or in regulatory environments like ports where they're not able to be turned on. Certainly,in polar kind of regions and actually getting a lot of services. The ARPUS have been pretty stable in the last year, probably in a slight decline justas prices have improved and as business service is stabilized to what I think the level that that service can provide. It can only go up to 128 kilobytesper second. What the new Certus devices going from 352 to 704 pretty quickly here in 2019, I think we're going to see ARPUS increase with thatproduct more applications, more standalone applications and of course it will continue to be a great companion device.

Really 100%for the planet eventual is the market and that's quite substantial. A lot of those have been waiting until it gets closer to commercial deploymentto commit, but I'm really impressed I think their pipeline in 2018. There is a really significant group of customers who are in discussions right towardsdata service contracts including some very large ANSPs.

1866,64388867,"FEBRUARY 22, 2018",Q4 2017 Iridium Communications Inc Earnings Call,Thomas J. Fitzpatrick,Iridium Communications Inc.,"Sure. So I'm not going to parse out all the elements that make up our guidance, but we did indicate that hosted payloads is $25 million. A littlemore background on the Aireon data fee which is charged and paid monthly, it's based on a fee for each of the 66 NEXT satellites in operation. Thefee is impacted by a customer contract milestone which when cleared causes the monthly fee for operating satellite to increase form approximately$16,000 per month to approximately $28,500 per month per operating satellite. So our guidance assumes the lower rate in 2018, thus arriving atthe approximately $8 million number. And the higher number for the majority of 2019. So that's pretty detailed guidance on what we're thinkingas far as hosted payloads. You would observe as the IoT business grew 13%, grew revenue=s 13% and we don't see that stopping, so that's certainlygoing to be helpful. We think the Talus revenues will be up materially. We see stability in our commercial voice and data ARPU, you saw that in themost recent quarter. We view commercial voice and data ARPU as quite firm. And so that's kind of the analysis going into the guide. I would saywhat gives us confidence that we're going to get a government renewal is our sort of 20-year history with the US government. The fact that they'regrowing their subs at 19%, we think the outcome, as I said in my prepared remarks, will be a win for us and will be a win for them.

There is roomthere to sort of recover a little bit of that in an unlimited environment which we continue to billion there will be. A lot of other positive things havehappened recently too. As you know, we just started shipping the first new secure handset that they've had in quite a number of years. Smaller,lighter, better. The distributed tactical communication services global is moving and there are more tactical radios on different platforms. Youmight have seen the announcement yesterday of a new platform for all of the basically aviation raised that the government uses called the RapidCones R210. Their ability to expand that. And then IoT is really expanding broadly in a whole bunch of areas in Blue Force tracking kind of applications,vehicle tracking, fuel monitoring, all kinds of other applications. So on all that basis we're not projecting large growth necessarily in this area, butsome growth is appropriate and still ends up bringing a lot of value to the government.

It could still turn out differently, but the general feeling between us is that what we've been doing for thelast 5 years obviously has worked very well. So maintaining that structure for kind of unlimited service for a very specific narrow band applicationsmakes the most sense. And the government really procures broadband services in a different way anyway. And that really shouldn't be an unlimitedservice, so it's going to be a more pay for use. Comsat by the way was the perfect choice. They are the primary vehicle today for providing broadbandto the, L-Band broadband to the US government. And given when you move into the broadband space, applications care more important thanthey are on the narrow banc side. Expertise and service, for security and all kinds of other applications are real important. So Comsat is a greatvehicle for that and an ideal way to move quickly into the government. Who by the way, is already deploying, is really planning on in 2018 deploying     Certus information at their gateway.

We've been by far, as the premium and I think highest quality and furthest reachingsolution, have done better than anyone else over the years. But as you know, people have made runs at us in the past with low cost devices thinkingthey'd kind of peel away a lot of customers and that hasn't been very successful. The floor though is shrinking. Certainly, we know one has kind ofmoved into becoming a spectrum arbitrager. And in fact, I'm not even sure they have new handsets anymore. It doesn't look like they've investedin a new handset. They're announced nothing nor do the channels know of anything. I don't believe they even have new handsets to sell. Another,as you know, a regional operator in the Middle East has not figured out what its future is. And really, the partner abase ad customer base knowsthat they may be timing out. So I think their revenues are declining as people are afraid to make major new commitments to them for handsets.So essentially the floor has shrunk to 2 and that environment is well understood and we don't see anybody else kind of coming along there. Evenas we've been adding new company. Push-to-Talk has been a new adder in the last couple of years and there's a really pretty broad pipeline aroundthe world for lots of -- Department of Emergency Services and MODs and others who like PPT and we see the aviation segment just introduced aproduct for PTT, Latitude is going to provide it for like medevac and other kind of applications in aviation where Push-to-Talk makes sense. So allthat kind of goes to say that why we're seeing so much stability wright now in that space as opposed to couple of years ago where it was slightdecline over time.

You'd have to bet that everything went fine with the launchesand just as soon as you got done, you'd refinance. And that was little too close for our comfort.
